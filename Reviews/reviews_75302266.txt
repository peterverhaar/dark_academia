5953392308	Anything can be taken from you, at any moment. Even the past isn’t guaranteed. You can lose that too, slowly, like water eating away at stone.Video version of this review that I totally make it through without crying can be found here.There is a lot going on in A Study in Drowning. It’s about institutional sexism in academia; about how young women are simultaneously treated as too insipid and frivolous to be of any consequence and yet also held responsible for the predation of the men who demand power over them. It’s about stories and the relationship between author and reader; about who really owns a story and decides what it means. It’s about all the ways your voice can be taken from you - both by others and eaten away at within yourself - and what it takes to get it back, if you can. All of this is wrapped within a Dark Academia tale of mystery and romance (of the academic rivals variety) in a rotting old house on a cliff, intertwined with themes of the disconnect between religious, superstitious folklore and academic agnosticism. This book will have you questioning perceptions of reality and not knowing who or what to believe. And all of it works so beautifully. A seamless blend of narrative, characters I absolutely loved, mysteries to unravel, and an ambiguously fantastical setting that you will question again and again. I loved this book so very much. On the note of characters, I can’t not speak about the main character, Effy.You don’t have to take up a sword. Survival is bravery, too.Effy Sayre is for the soft girls. The anxiety girls. The “I’ve been rehearsing my Starbucks order since I got in line” girls. The “life has made my fight or flight response heavily weighted toward flight for my own survival” girls. I love her. She’s not going to pick up a sword and get a training montage to defeat her enemies on a battlefield, she’s not always going to have the right quip at just the right time, and she’s not always going to have the right answers, but she shows that there’s a strength in softness. That it’s strength enough to survive and that the ways we find to make it through the day are valid. She’s not a perfect character, she has very real flaws beyond the sometimes trite “quirks that a romantic partner will find cute,” and it’s part of what makes her authentic and leaves room through the writing for real growth. Almost as soon as I started this book I knew there was no chance that I was going to be Normal about it. Effy, has my whole heart. I love her, I feel protective of her, and I will lay down my life for her. (Remember, not going to be Normal about this). She distinctly puts this in the rare category of books that make me feel Seen as a human being, alongside others like VE Schwab’s The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue and John Green’s Turtles All The Way Down. This is personal, it feels very singular (though it definitionally is not), and it absolutely elevates the experience of an already fantastic book. This idea is reflected in the story as well. To paraphrase, “Writing [a book is] like shining a beacon from a lighthouse…Are there any ships on the horizon? Will they signal back…?” It reminds me of the Kazuo Ishiguro quote “In the end, stories are about one person saying to another: This is the way it feels to me. Can you understand what I’m saying? Does it feel this way to you?” And so, yes, I am the ship on the horizon signaling back. It feels this way to me too. And for that, A Study in Drowning holds a very special place in my heart. Five Stars.

6312828937	You could not have paid me to care, this was so boring.Also, if you're going to have enemies to lovers, maybe make the love interest an actual 'enemy' and not just having the MC be prejudiced against him because he's from a different country. Is the 'enemies to lovers' in the room with us? For example, Preston asks her to put a seat belt on, and Effy cynically tells us that he is treating her like a child. Preston checks out books from the library, and Effy felt entitled to them first.So again I ask - where was the enemy? A one-sided prejudiced rivalry does not an enemies-to-lovers make.
5953392334	A Study in Drowning is a swirling tempest of hope, love, and finding a way forward against all odds.

She finds a literature scholar, Preston got there ahead of her and is investigating a mystery that is going to question and possibly destroy the longtime admiration that Effy has for her literary hero as well as this author's legacy.***OMFGGHGGGGG- a good friend of mine bought me a copy and had it delivered as a surprise so it reasons that i have read it rtfn 😭😭🔫
5838968641	The writing and atmospheric vibes were NICE.The story was MID The two MC's were BLANDI'll elaborate more later 🫡
5953392374	This fascinating gothic mansion/haunted house theme has a twisty mystery and powerful feminist vibes! The horror, mystery, enemies-to-lovers romance, paranormal, and psychological thriller genres are perfectly blended at the same portal. The riveting mystery makes you guess until the end as the spine-tingling, eerie, drowning house pushes you to hide under blankets. You're drawn into the unreliable narration of the traumatized heroine and complex storytelling. But this book is more than a dark academia, paranormal fantasy, or bone-chilling horror novel! This is also a thought-provoking, bold, profound, and empowering story about women with #MeToo movement representation. That's what makes it unique, brave, and more powerful! I devoured it in a few hours! The execution of the story was well-crafted. The myths, folklore, urban legend parts, and shocking, challenging backstory make the book extra captivating and unputdownable!The story revolves around young Effy Sayre, who is delicate and dealing with hallucinations of the Fairy King since her childhood. She is the only woman student in the architecture department, even though she dreamed of focusing her studies on literature: she can recite the entire words of Emrys Myrddin's Angharad. She is socially outcasted after rumors about her involvement with her adviser professor. She is so close to getting dropped from the faculty, failing from classes, and her neglectful, alcoholic mother has no intention of doing anything with her. Her favorite author, Myrddin's death, also affected her deeply. The book he has written is the only thing that can empower her to fight against her nighttime terrors.When she applied with her project to redesign Myrddin's estate, Hiraeth Manor, which resides in a very dangerous part of the country, she didn't expect to be chosen for this impossible task. But she gets an invitation telling her that all of her expenses will be covered for six weeks, including her travel fees.When she arrives at the dilapidated house, which is hardly affected by the last drowning and crumbling into pieces, she not only meets Myrddin's eccentric son, but she also finds out that a literature scholar, Preston Heloury, also works with the letters and manuscripts of the late author with a secret agenda.He rubs her the wrong way because this condescending, stubborn, pragmatic boy is a literature scholar even though he's Argentinean, while she was rejected from the same faculty because she's female! When she finds out Preston is conducting a secret investigation to prove that Myrddin is a fraud because there are inconsistencies with his signature on the letters written for the publisher, and he didn't have a background as an uneducated fisherman's boy to write an epic masterpiece, Effy becomes livid.But Effy's nightmares about the Fairy King increase. The awkward manners of Myrddin's son, the ill widow who is locked in her room they didn't see, and the secret passages of the manor increase her suspicions as well. She teams up with Preston to find out the truth about the manor and Myrddin, not only for her curiosity but also to end her misery about her biggest childhood mystery!Overall, this book is scary, ominous, intense, moving, bold, and one of the best reads I've had lately!Many thanks to NetGalley and HarperCollins Children's Books/HarperTeen for sharing this amazing book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter
5943285063	"i will love you to ruination." this is exactly how i feel about this book.
5831822932	"i will love you to ruination.""yours or mine?"ava reid is just one of those authors where i feel like i'm falling slowly into the book, enveloped by my own senses as the her masterful imagery illustrates her story. it's a slow lull that draws you in, like waves rising on the shore that before you know it, you've reached high tide."it began as all things did: a girl on the shore, terrified and desirous."effy sayre is timid, unassuming, and afraid. she desperately wants to break out of her shell, to spill out the words and dreams inside her, but is paralyzed by fear. she yearns to be a writer, but is resigned as a woman to study architecture instead (as the only woman in her college, it was enough of a fight for that alone). reid cleverly likens the dissociation one may experience post-trauma to being underwater - effy struggles to swim, and her anxiety comes in waves.the story is about her finding her voice again and breaking to surface, learning to not let herself drown.the only enemy is the sea."it's terrifying.""most beautiful things are."reid's use of the sea as a supernatural force, an ever-present threat, a means of escape, and, later, a symbol of peace is poetic and powerful. the storms make for an ominous atmosphere, with saltwater's ability to erode land, ships, and man. but there is also a mystical element, a way of cocooning or stepping out of reality when effy disconnects. the idea of drowning - how one can suffer, silently. "it can take 10 minutes to drown" ianto tells her. that sometimes people pass away weeks later from the after effects of drowning. but some people drown for a whole lifetime.i didn't know how to do anything but wait and drown.she wondered if you could love something out of ruination, reverse that drowning process, make it all new again.perhaps a romance is a story with no end at all; where the end is but a wardrobe with a false back, leading to stranger and more merciful worlds.the romance between effy and preston was a delightful surprise for me. i went into this book as blind as i could be, though i had some preconceived notions about the tone and vibes from art and just seeing posts around. but i hadn't realized there would be such friction between the two of them from the start, effy rebuffed at being stuck in proximity with a literature student (and the envy she felt, only doubled by the fact he borrowed all the books she wanted lol). their banter was delightful, the small seeds and buds of effy effortlessly blooming back into herself. she's never afraid to speak up around him, and the gentleness preston provides her lets her continue to grow and build trust with him. he's the only character who really sees her."you'd be surprised how much cognitive dissonance people are capable of."he hadn't touched her, but saints, she wanted him to."you took away all other wanting from me."ava loves motif and imagery. preston and his glasses, the indents. his cigarettes. the fairy king's dark hair, echoed on master corbenic's arms, as well as ianto's. corbenic's large hands to preston's slim, smooth fingers. angharad's blond hair mixing into the fairy king's dark locks. clear eyes, murky eyes. and water, the ever-present sea. the ceilings leak. the water rises. effy's stomach churns like a violent riptide. reid leaves breadcrumbs for you to trail and mull over. the wavering connection between reality and fable keeps you guessing at what is the truth - and what exactly is truth.i was a woman when it was convenient to blame me, and a girl when they wanted to use me.it's very hard to believe something when it feels like the whole world is trying to convince you otherwise.at the heart of this story is a feminist commentary on academics, literature, and society as a whole. women are expected to be meek and unassuming, they are thought to be too capricious and silly for deep thinking, philosophizing, and even storytelling. they are not listened to and when they are, not believed. they are thought to be too childish, but also too tempting. this is a fantasy piece that follows in the footsteps of the #MeToo movement and its lasting effects during the years since.effy and her story is one that resonated greatly with me. after ASID and lady macbeth, reid is well on their way to securing themselves as a spot as one of my favorite authors.but if fairies and monsters were real, so were the women who defeated them.
5912091185	✎𓂃 “I will love you to ruination” Well.This book WAS my ruination. TY my friends for sticking with me through it all 🫠 ☆1: This felt unnecessarily long These chapters. Ugh I am not a long chapter person at all. HATE them with every fiber of my being!! Each one in this book was about 20-30min on my kindle, and if I’m not excited about a book? It draaaaaaags. 373 pages ended up feeling more like 600. 😴 Honestly still surprised I didn't DNF! Every other page had me goin, "IMMA DNF (but maybe the next page will be ok)". Nope. It wasn't. ☆2: Found it lacking all the things From the characters, to the plot, to the world this book is set, there was no depth across the board. There is a whole lotta misogyny, AND they need to research this famous author, AND there’s a Fairy King Effy may or may not be able to see? All of these plot points were battling for my attention, and not a single one broke the surface level. It severely needed direction, and a more seamless way to get there. Also was the Fairy King even needed????Effy could have been a much stronger character. And yes, she has her moment towards the end, but her unreliability as a main character got on my nerves. Is what she’s seeing real, or not? Is she just naive? What is her fascination with older men with a hell of a lot of arm hair??? (Yes, that last one I get, but I couldn’t get over how it’s the first thing she notices. Don't mind me over here gagging from the thought 🤢). Between the lack of depth and the writing style (on the side of poetic, but The Sheperd King series does it so much better), I felt like this book didn’t stir any sort of emotion in me. I promise it doesn’t take much–I LOVE to scream at a book when characters are wronged or are being stupid, when the twist is dropped, or esp. when the leads *finally* get to the action. But even the romance wasn’t romantic! There was such a slow build (like everything else) and then BAM. It wasn’t earned, and tbh along with the rest of the book, it was just boring. I never want to leave a book feeling indifferent, but here I am…A Study in Drowning had so much potential to be so much more. Effy and Preston’s banter, the overall intrigue, even the gothic creepiness of Ianto and the house, it all needed the dial RAMPED UP on drama meter. Then, and only then would I give this book a try. ☆3: But my fav part? Effy’s roommate names all the spiders they find in their dorm after men. After someone asks her roomie why, this is her response: “Because then it feels more satisfying to squish them.” (Not me using this strategy from now on and naming all spiders after my shitty exes)OKAY MATT I SEE YOU ON THE WALL THERE 👀
5963020001	this had potential but it relied too heavily on pretty writing and vibes. the plot dragged as the mystery of the manor and myrddin’s legacy should have been exciting but the pacing was slow. when the answers did reveal themselves, it just felt underwhelming rather than shocking. preston and effy had the beginnings of an enemies to allies dynamic but it lacked spark as the tension never built up and their connection felt more convenient.
7782599249	A gothic fever dream wrapped in feminist fire—haunting, lyrical and defiantly sharp. 02:40 ━━━━●───── 04:47Now playing- Chemtrails over the Country Club- Lana Del Reyㅤ ㅤ ◁ㅤ ❚❚ ㅤ▷It was like conjuring a tempest!! This was my first time reading anything by Ava Reid. And oh my God! What did I just read!In A Study in Drowning, she crafts this tale that feels like it was dredged from the depths of a storm-tossed sea and stitched together with ink and bone.Dark Academia x Fairy Tale- where the ghosts of literature are just as dangerous as the ones that haunt the cliffs of Hiraeth Manor.Effy Sayre, our brilliant and bruised protagonist, is the only female architecture student at a university that bars women from studying literature. Her escape? A contest to design the crumbling estate of her literary idol, Emrys Myrddin. But what begins as a dream project quickly unravels into a gothic mystery, as Effy and her reluctant rival Preston Héloury dig into the mythos surrounding Myrddin’s most famous work, Angharad—a tale of a mortal woman and a cruel Fairy King. What if the fairy tale was never fiction? What if the author was never honest?The prose was extremely lush and lyrical, like ivy creeping over stone!! Ahhh!! The Welsh-inspired setting was so vividly rendered that I could almost taste the salt in the air. But, sadly, beneath the beauty lies a blade- this is a story about erasure, about who gets to write history and who gets buried beneath it. Effy’s journey is not just one of uncovering literary fraud— it’s a reclamation of voice, of agency of truth.Spoiler warning!!!However, there were some flaws with the characters. (view spoiler)[I did not like Effy's initial hatred towards Preston. I understand and it's completely relatable about the sexism part. I get that the country is in war but it annoyed me when she constantly brought up Preston's ethnicity. Like dude! Yes, he’s from another country but that doesn’t mean he has some secret agenda. But then again I understand, trust issues:(Another thing!!What the hell was the relationship between Effy and her mother? Like, yes, it was later on revealed. But no child deserves that toxic environment!!! (hide spoiler)]Spoiler ends!!The rom between Effy and Preston simmered with tension and wit, a slow-burn that felt earned and electric!! Their dynamic—rivals (Well, the rivalry was one sided) turned reluctant allies—mirrors, the collision between myth and reality, power and vulnerability, silence and speech... so wonderful!!A heroine who refuses to drown quietly!!Lastly, I'm so glad that we could buddy read this together, MY DEAREST MINZILLA!!!

7048807879	1⭐️Sigh...what an utter disappointment 🙂 I was not expecting to dislike this book as much as I did. On every level of execution, it failed...in my eyes. Please keep in mind that this review will go over how *I* viewed the book. I always feel I need to explain that when I rate a book so low. 😭Let's start off with the characters, shall we? I could not connect with them at all. Effy, the FMC, ended up feeling so shallow and her character and personality wasn't fleshed out at ALL. I think that is something that would have really helped, as the history with her parents and the story of The Fairy King (iykyk) COULD have been so good. We get a few pieces of info here and there and I was begging, screaming for more information. It kinda got swept under the rug. The relationship between Effy and Preston was meh. Again, very surface level. However, I didn't mind the "academic" rivals to lovers trope.Now, the plot...oh my god was this book so boring. Like I stated about the characters, I wanted so much more from this book. The pacing was uneven and the plot is not very clear. When I tell you I was genuinely confused for a majority of this book...I wouldn't even say that it's because I'm not as well versed in this overall genre. I think it's a matter of writing style and clarity. The clarity was piss poor and the explanation for everything was just atrocious. Everything about this book has screamed SHALLOW! It had so much potential, but it severely lacked in almost every department.The one thing I did like about this was the world and Ava Reid's ability to describe a beautiful scene. I found the writing to be more simplistic at times that shouldn't have mattered and too complex in those that should have.Overall, I inevitably liked one thing about this book and it was the part that didn't add much to the plot or story. I expected so much more; I cannot tell you how sad and disappointed I am that this ended up missing the mark so bad. It's safe to say I will not be reading the next book when it comes out, as I don't think this series is for me. As for Ava Reid's other books? Well, that's to be determined. All I know is that I hated this and can see why there are so many mixed reviews for it.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ready for something a bit...✨different✨I don't know much about historical, gothic fantasy but I'm itching to find out 🩶

At first it was annoying because I’m going to admit I love a confident badass FMC. However, after learning about her trauma and past I completely understood and felt sorry for her. When she stood up for herself at the end of the book I was so clapping and jumping up and down 👏🏼👏🏼 She discovers her voice and starts feeling comfortable in her own skin.. I was so happy to watch the transformation.Preston is so sweet and caring. I loved the care he took with Effy. It warmed my heart 🥹🥹 I have no words. I loved how he supported her and stood by her side..He shows a real man doesn’t have to be always be macho or broody.Their romance was sweet and tender which I think is different from what I normally read but I loved them for each other. Overall thoughts: I would recommend this book. It’s not fast paced and it’s a lot going on even though it’s not much happening.. trust the process. It’s a story that will stay with me and I will think about in the future. Questions still on my mind:Was the fairy king real or did he represent the evil/envy in some men?Are ghosts real or are they figments of our imagination, trauma and/or fears? If you read feel free to message me… I think this is a book that has many layers

5953392425	“You don’t have to take up a sword. Survival is bravery, too.” this is an dark academia story, set in a historical but different world than our own, where two regional factions (north and south) are at war with one another, and two students who are from different sides (and who attend the same university) are tasked with different academic missions at a very remote sea side manor that is falling into the sea. this is also a story about storytelling and finding safety and comfort and escapism in words and tales and myths. even if this story at the heart of this is about a fae king who will stop at nothing to take and take and take what his entitled self views as his. this is very atmospheric and the writing is so very good. i loved the themes of this story and the emphasis on power in regards to reclaiming your life and agency and voice after really horrible things happen to you. and how there is so much power in knowing you aren’t alone, and that there is power in giving a voice to not only yourself but the others who were silenced before you, and the power of just knowing that people believe you. but sadly, i just didn’t love the actual story of this one, even though it had so much that i did love. it felt very long and tedious to read, and it was so very predictable in every way. i don’t want to call this book boring, because it just seems wrong with all the aspects that i enjoyed, but i really had to force myself to pick this one up each night for some reason. maybe i just had too high of hopes for it and it really hindered my reading experience? ultimately, i just couldn’t connect with this story or the characters, even if i really respect the themes of this book and the care the author put into this story. but i also know this book will be very powerful to a lot of readers, so please know that i still recommend this and very much implore you to look at other reviews! i just want to also note - the last line of this book is very powerful. i think it’s been a long while since the last sentence of a book made me pause the way this one did (and then the last acknowledgement being to zelda… was everything). very powerful, and i hope everyone reading this can feel lighter and safer and drown all their demons, too. trigger + content warnings: predatory behavior, abuse of power, power imbalances, grooming, gaslighting, mentions of sexual assault, unwanted touching, sexism + misogyny, panic attacks, ptsd, nightmares, mention of war, spider mention, death, blood mentions, mention of loss of parent in past, car accident in past, abandonment, grief, incorrect medical diagonis, bad parenting, mention of parent abusing alcohol, a lot of talk of medication, a lot of smoking, blood mentions, mention of a dead animal, torture descriptions in past, talk of child death/sacrifice in past in a myth/story, and drowningblog | instagram | youtube | kofi | spotify | amazon
5797937143	“I will love you to ruination.”This book was so good! This was a mysterious and dark historical fantasy about power, misogyny, love, and finding yourself. A Study in Drowning follows Effy, is an architecture student at a prestigious college who has a chance to redesign her favorite author's estate. When she arrives Preston, a student from the literature school is trying to find evidence that her favorite author is a fraud. Effy soon discovers dangerous secrets that will change her view on the world."You're not just one thing. Survival is something you do, not something you are. You're brave and brilliant. You're the most real, full person I've ever met."It took me a little while to become immersed in this book, but once I did I fell in love with the characters and the gothic world. The writing is beautiful and very lyrical. The plot was interesting and engaging, although it was predicable. I loved the gothic and dark academic vibes, it's the perfect read for a rainy fall day. The world building was very interesting, but it was confusing to me at first. I enjoyed the incorporation of a fairy tale into the story. The author did an excellent job of discussing misogyny and showing that women are not treated fairly compared to men. This book's message of inequality is very important and relatable in the real world. I really enjoyed the ending, it resolved the story and made me proud. I appreciated how the author discussed anxiety, several people in my family have anxiety and the author showed it in a realistic way. I love Effy, she is brave, smart, resilient, ambitious and kind. I just wanted to protect her and I was so proud of her for standing up for herself. I can relate to Effy, I have a softer side and I can get anxious when meeting new people. Effy's character development was excellent, Effy became more confident in herself throughout the book. I really liked Preston, he is smart, ambitious, hardworking and helpful. I liked how he treated Effy, he was kind to her and wasn't overbearing. I felt that the chemistry between Effy and Preston was lacking, I didn't feel their connection till the very end of the book. I liked that academic rivalry, but I was hoping for more banter. I did like that both Effy and Preston could be themselves around each other and neither tried to change the other person.

Almost none of my friends liked this, so I avoided it for a long time, but the cover is so gorgeous and it sounded so good that I had to give in and read it– and I was immediately sucked in. The author paints the rich dark academic city and the dreary cliffside manor settings beautifully. I was blown away by how lovely the writing was, not to mention the way it gracefully tackles the themes of sexism and even a little bit of SA.🪞 ii. character study :effy ༄.° I loved her so much! I wasn’t expecting her character to be so deep. I loved how the effect of her slowly feeling like she was drowning was portrayed. I also loved how driven she was. She had amazing character development!preston ༄.° very much a cutie patootie. He had glasses, was a little awkward, a nerd, but a gentleman <3 I loved how he helped effy heal from her trauma. They were so precious!📜iii. fav quotes : “There was an intimacy to all violence, she supposed; the better you knew someone, the more terribly you could hurt them.”“You can never be too cautious. People have died in much more banal ways.”“Thank you for giving me the chance to die of something interesting, then.”“That was the truth at the center of everything, the truth she had tried for so long to evade: there were no fairies, no magic, and the world was just ordinary and cruel.”“The ephemerality of things is what gives them meaning. That things are only beautiful because they don’t last. Full moons, flowers, you.”“I was a woman when it was convenient to blame me, and a girl when they wanted to use me.”
5961151277	“I was a woman when it was convenient to blame me, and a girl when they wanted to use me.” That quote is very good, even as I was trudging to the end, I really felt it. Ugh, I'm so conflicted about this book. On one hand, I was intrigued throughout the book, I never got very bored, but on another hand, that didn't really help me actually like the book. And oh boy, the romance was a yikes.The concept was interesting, and I kept getting House of Salt and Sorrow vibes, which is funny because the author wrote a blurb for this book.The PlotAs I said, the book follows an intriguing premise, which is the whole reason I picked the book up in the first place, but the execution just wasn't as well as I'd liked it to have been. The beginning was just completely rushed and there was just so much background information, some of which we had to find out throughout the book, which I had because then it just makes me irritated that I don't understand something, and some things I still don't understand, if they were explained. Like what's a Sleeper? It was probably explained at one point and I missed it, but there was no other reference in the rest of the book as to what they could be, unless they're just famous authors? I really don't know.I did really like the overall vibes to the book, like a dark fantasy almost, always gray and dreary in my mind. But this book really needed a map, because there were so many different locations in the book and everything would've just been much simpler if there was a map 😭It also felt like there was just so much going on, that the book needed to be bigger. It's only a bit over 300 pages, so it felt like certain things were rushed and just not fleshed out well enough, and some reveals were far too casual, and I had to do a double take and flip back a few pages as if I'd missed something.Away from the negatives, I was truly interested in what was happening in this book, like the whole lore and mystery of finding out more about the mysterious author and diving into his secrets, it was very entertaining. I also really like how the author handled the subject of the extreme misogyny occurring in the book against Effy and all women, it was very nice to read about.Also, I feel like the ending is supposed to mean something but I honestly have no idea what it's supposed to mean, and it cut off so abruptly and ended so oddly.“That was the cruelest irony: the more you did to save yourself, the less you became a person worth saving.”The CharactersInitially, I was completely indifferent towards Effy, but as the store went on, oh my, she started getting on my nerves. She was so prejudiced towards Preston just because he was Argantian, and she acted as if just because she was Llyrian she had more of a right to certain things than he did, which is crazy. There was a lot of trauma that she had to go through, from her childhood to when she was in university, and I feel for her, but it just felt so confusing to truly process what she'd been through, since certain things are just revealed to us throughout the story that I think we would've already known since we're in her perspective (though it is in third person if I remember correctly), so it just didn't feel well drawn out. Her character also felt very staggered, because at some points she was terrified of certain things, then other times she was incredibly fearless.I suppose those could also be because of all of the medications she had to take, but it just felt very abrupt for me. I do appreciate that Preston wasn't like all the other guy characters I've read about recently, but he was also just so bland. There was no factor about him that would have him stand out at all if I put him next to other male main characters from other books. He just didn't seem very developed, and didn't really change in my opinion throughout the book to make himself more interesting. “I will love you to ruination.”The Romance😀Now if you know me, you know that for me, the romance in a book is crucial, and if it is not well executed, I will automatically hate the book, or at least dislike it for that aspect. I did not enjoy the romance in this book.It was a pitiful attempt at an enemies to lovers sort of thing, and it just makes it worse because that's my favorite trope, and it was not very good in this case 😭The tension between them was supposed to be immediate, since Effy hated Preston for taking her books, which I thought was weird in the first place, like it's really not that deep, girl, and then she began to go off on him about him being Argantian and that just did not sit well with me, like they were trying to base the 'enemies' to lovers based off of Effy's one-sided hatred for Preston because of his background and what ethnicity he was. Besides that, the two fell in 'love' way too fast. As I said, the book is only like 300 pages long, which is definitely not enough time to fully flesh out a whole relationship, and I'm pretty sure the book was not that long of a time frame, meaning they said their I love you's so so fast. They just had no tension, and I get the attraction at first sight, I'll believe that, but Effy went from hating him so quickly to being friends with him, and then to the love. It just was not written out properly, and I'm really sad that it just wasn't good. “But stories were devious things, things with agendas. They could cheat and steal and lie to your face. They could crumble away under your feet.”Wow I really need to start writing reviews right after I read books, because this is like the first actually in depth review I've written in a while and I'm honestly proud of myself 😭Anyways, overall, the concept of this book was really interesting, but I just did not find it enjoyable 😬3 stars ““How terrible, to navigate the world without a story to comfort you.” <><><><><><><>I'm torn between giving this book 2 stars or 3. Like it wasn't inherently bad, but it was not very good imo😭 I also feel like the ending is supposed to mean something but I have no idea what 🫠this is a book that needs a map in the frontrtc
6913667652	renaming the book a study in boring, TREES WERE WASTED ON THIS BOOK
6786990539	2,8 *Fantasy ibrido narrato da un punto di vista solido - si tratta di una protagonista con uno sviluppo credibile e intelligente - che si accompagna a una trama e un'ambientazione affascinante, brumosa, molto vicina al new gothic. Al centro c'è una ricerca filologica che potrebbe furbescamente rimandare all'ambito dark academia. Lo sviluppo del mondo creato, però, è parecchio scricchiolante (non è ben chiaro il livello tecnologico della società e risulta debole anche l'esplorazione politica). In generale, c'è troppa faciloneria per i miei gusti, soprattutto nella parte sentimentale (che comunque scritta in maniera più sottile avrebbe funzionato bene). Manca un po' di spessore nell'impianto stilistico ma rimane una lettura titillante per chi ama il folklore cupo - siamo distanti anni luce dalle fatine di Maas - e le storie di rivalsa.

Survival is bravery, too.” ༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･In case you didn't see my pre-read, I made my brother pick a random book from my physical TBR for me to start because I didn't know what to read next after finishing my last read. I think my rating and not liking the book was lowkey payback/karma for me telling him his favorite local burger place was closing.There were some things I liked about the story; however, there were so many other things--some minor issues that built up and some bigger ones--that didn't sit right with me as I was reading. Over time, all those issues built up and made my reading experience much less enjoyable.Let's start with the good. I think it's better to list them out in this review:1. The atmosphere: Ava Reid did such a good job at creating a dark academia/gothic atmosphere. Think dark, gloomy, autumn days, rain, everyone smoking cigarettes or drinking coffee, the setting is at a manor/mansion set by the water or at an arts university where everyone is a literature, architecture, or music major (at least as far as we know based on Effy and her friends). It's the perfect autumn read on a rainy day. Curl up in a blanket and light a candle, drink some coffee or tea, and read this book on a rainy autumn day if you want the full atmospheric experience!2. How the topics of sexual harassment and sexual assault were handled and discussed: Without going into too much detail, the topic of SA is a major part of Effy, our FMC's, backstory. As someone who is a victim of SA myself--it's not something I talk about or bring up but I thought it was important to in this scenario--I appreciated how Ava Reid approached the topic with care. She did a great job writing about how that affected Effy in her everyday life and I loved Effy for being able to find her voice and become stronger throughout the story. I can see how people like myself can read about Effy and relate to parts of her character and maybe even find her story and character arc comforting in some aspects, even if she is just a fictional character. Victims of SA have to live the rest of their lives knowing what's happened to them and it can leave a long-lasting impact on their mental and emotional health and well-being, and I think Effy's character did a great job at showing that.There is also a lot of misogynistic dialogue from some male side characters throughout the story, and though it is a fictional fantasy world, it seems to be based around what would be equivalent to the late 1800s to early-mid 1900s or so in the real world. It seems to be period-typical, but I liked how Effy continued to defy those societal norms and Preston kept supporting her throughout the story.3. Preston and Effy: I liked how Preston challenged Effy to see things from a different perspective and vice versa. Their banter was mostly academic banter and then going back and forth, but they were willing to learn from each other and grow intellectually and emotionally. They grew with each other and I think that's the best way to grow in a relationship with someone.Now, the bad. (***I'm going to mention some scenes from the book but none are spoilers for the overall plot. Just wanted to put this here as a disclaimer***)I'm sure lots of other reviewers pointed this out already, but it rubbed me the wrong way that Effy and Preston are probably considered "enemies to lovers" or "academic rivals to lovers." Effy initially hates Preston solely because he is from a bordering country (Argant) that's currently in a war with hers (Llyr). The real kicker is that Preston's mom is FROM Llyr, so he's half Argantian on his dad's side. Her hatred was...something else. Like, she felt entitled to a bunch of books HE borrowed from the library because he’s a LITERATURE MAJOR writing a paper/thesis on it just because the books were about HER country’s beloved author and he has no right to read them….even though his mom is from Llyr and his dad is from Argant, he's the one writing a paper on it, and frankly, he got to the books before she did. Like, that’s the main reason why she doesn’t like him at first. Her thoughts were along the lines of, "He has NO right to study MY country's literature in MY country and learn about MY country's authors and how they impacted MY country's culture and history. He has NO right to check out books from a PUBLIC LIBRARY because the books are about MY country's beloved author and he's not from here. He's not allowed to read them or check them out before I get to read them even though I had NO idea he even existed until I found out he checked them out of the library." That's like saying that a person can't study abroad and immerse themselves in that country's culture while they live there because they don't live there and aren't from there so they "wouldn't understand or fully appreciate the culture." Be so for real. I think that's also partly why I didn't feel any real romance between Effy and Preston. Sure, they challenged each other academically and I loved that about their relationship and overall dynamic, but knowing that Effy holds that prejudice against Preston deep down rubbed me the wrong way.I felt the climax of the story was somewhat anticlimactic? I can't go into it any further without spoiling the book, but there is a certain scene that I thought would go down way differently but a character does a simple, mundane move and it's all over. It started filled with tension and I sort of expected that people would be putting up a fight the entire way through and wouldn't go down as easily as they did. The ending of the story tied things up pretty nicely, in my opinion, and I'm honestly not sure why a second book needs to be written but I'll be along for the ride and reading the second book when it comes out this summer.Also, I need to say this as a pharmacist. It's a super minor thing that probably wouldn't bug most people beyond the fact it's mentioned SO many times throughout the book, but Effy constantly swallowing her meds dry (AKA with no water) made the pharmacist in me CRINGE. I was banging my head against the book every time Ava Reid wrote something about Effy taking her meds dry. Fun fact for those who aren't aware: taking your meds with water actually helps the drug kick into your system more efficiently when your body starts to absorb and metabolize the drug and can prevent unwanted side effects. So, don't forget to take your meds with water! Overall, while I enjoyed the atmosphere of the book and the way Effy grows and overcomes her past, the bad outweighed the good in this story. It wasn't fantastic, but I also don't feel like it was downright horrible to deserve a 1-star rating. I'll be picking up A Theory of Dreaming in July to see what happens with Effy and Preston next so hopefully things will be better in the next one!2.5 stars༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･༄˖°.🍂.ೃ࿔*:･Trigger warnings (thank you to Trigger Warnings Database for this list!): Ableism/internalized ableism, sexual harassment & sexual assault mentioned, alcohol consumption & abuse, drug use (smoking), PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks, nightmares, amputation (protagonist is missing her finger), death of a parent mentioned, torture recounted, car accident recounted, drowning/attempted drowning, flood recounted, animal death mentioned𝒫𝓇𝑒-𝓇𝑒𝒶𝒹: I'm not gonna lie, I didn't choose this book to read next (I was undecided after I finished reading The Familiar and typical mood reader things lol).

The beginning was slow and confusing — just random pieces of information here and there that didn’t make much sense . And Effy? She annoyed me a lot at first 🥴. She cried too much, felt fragile and unstable, and I had to remind myself more than once that she was in university, not high school.But once she went to Myrddin’s hometown and met Preston, things started to shift. The story became more engaging, even though it kept that mysterious vibe (which I think was the point).

Smart, stubborn, bold, a little arrogant — but in the best way. I especially loved how careful he was with Effy, always afraid she’d misinterpret his actions as taking advantage of her. Instead of mocking her struggles, he praised her intelligence and courage. He saw in her what she couldn’t see in herself. He was her safe space 🫶🏻, the one who distracted her from the Fairy King and helped her rest without relying on medication.

7368086005	Перша книжка весни 🌿✅ після атмосферного «Дому Голлоу» захотілося ще чогось подібного і рука потягнулася до «Дослідження утоплення» Ави Рід (до речі, ви знали, що у неї українське коріння?) Я не прогадала саме з атмосферою та повним зануренням в історію, однак все-таки вона не справила на мене неймовірне враження і також викликала декілька запитань, головним з яких є чому авторка вирішила зробити це саме фентезі? Я вважаю, що історія могла бути тільки у виграші, якби це була сучасна проза з можливими нотками містики чи магічного реалізму. В цілому, 5⭐️ за атмосферу, 5⭐️ за ідею та проблематику, 4⭐️ за фінал і 2,5⭐️ за виконання (так мало, бо десь першу 1/3 мені було жахливо нудно і якби не аудіо книжка - ж вірогідність, я б призупинила читання, або мучила її дуже довго). Кого зацікавить такий мікс - темна академія + жорстокий принц + казки братів Грімм - сміливо беріть, не пошкодуєте!

7004241786	4,5⭐️! Es gibt diese Bücher, denen ich es nicht leicht mache, mich zu überzeugen. An "A Study in drowning" bin ich voreingenommen herangegangen - fest in dem Glauben, dass es nicht meinen Geschmack treffen wird. Das Erzähltempo ist in diesem Buch langsam, folglich ebenso die Handlung. Der Stil poetisch, melancholisch, aber eben auch detailversessen: Gerade zu Anfang nehmen die reinen Beschreibungen viel Raum ein. Dadurch wird die Atmosphäre unglaublich greifbar, gleichzeitig trägt dies nicht zum Ereignisreichtum bei. Obwohl diese Elemente normalerweise nicht meins wären, dieses Buch eigentlich nicht meins sein sollte, hat es mich am Ende doch so sehr überzeugt. Gerade aufgrund meiner einstigen Einstellung gegenüber dem Buch bedeutet es wirklich viel, wie sehr ich noch vom Storytelling mitgerissen wurde. Die Protagonisten haben sich besonders durch diese Details bezüglich ihrer Charaktereigenheiten (ja auch fehlerhafte Züge) in mein Herz geschlichen. Auch die Handlung konnte mich soweit fesseln, dass ich Theorien aufgestellt habe & unbedingt weiterlesen musste. Eine Wendung habe ich sehr früh vorhergesehen, was die Botschaft dahinter nicht schmälert - anderes konnte mich weiterhin überraschen. Besonders die Umsetzung des Misogynie- sowie Literatur-Themas waren für mich echt bewegend. Für mich vielleicht die größte Überraschung in diesem Lesejahr🤭!

5953392542	3.5 starsA Study in Drowning is a haunting gothic tale of strength and perseverance that blurs the lines between fairytale and reality. I enjoyed many aspects of this book and I respect what it contributes to the genre, but, unfortunately, I was left wanting more from the story. The gothic atmosphere is easily the strongest element of the book. Hiraeth Manor is a fascinating setting and I was obsessed with the idea of a house that is, quite literally, falling into the sea. “Everything ancient must decay”The crumbling estate and its many dark mysteries create a pervasive sense of wrongness and unease. This feeling is heightened by Effy’s self-reported status as an unreliable narrator. Ava Reid’s writing and repeated references to the metaphor of drowning further enhanced the gothic atmosphere making A Study in Drowning a quick and intriguing read. Ava Reid specializes in crafting powerful stories of female trauma and rage. A Study in Drowning captures the many conflicting ways that women are treated by society and the tendency for their voices to be lost. Effy proves that there is strength in softness and perseverance. Her experience was so raw and emotional and I know that it will resonate with many readers. I was really impressed by how Ava Reid presented these complex topics for a YA audience. “You don't have to take up a sword. Survival is bravery, too.” The gothic atmosphere and Effy’s trauma are both the book's main focus and its strengths. However, many other parts of the story felt underdeveloped in comparison. The untapped potential of the world-building and character development left me wanting more. Outside of Hiraeth Manor, the world-building is incredibly sparse. As this is a character-focused, gothic story I normally wouldn't have cared about the minimal world-building. However, Ava Reid presents so many intriguing concepts that go completely unexplained. The war only serves as a justification for Effy’s horrible behavior towards Preston when they first meet (side note: I was quite disappointed that Effy never had to confront her prejudice). I never understood the two countries’ history and relationship. There was some discussion of religious differences but I would have loved a bit more context. The Sleepers were criminally underexplored. The concept of authors who are believed to provide magical protection for an entire country is absolutely fascinating. Given the focus on the late author Emrys Myrddin and the importance of stories to both main characters, I expected this concept to be more fleshed out. But other than the occasional discussion of how Effy and Preston’s investigation would be viewed by the Sleeper Museum, the concept is never developed. Between the gothic atmosphere, Preston and Effy, and the mysteries of Hiraeth Manor, A Study in Drowning had plenty of interesting concepts. But these false starts in the world-building left the story feeling incomplete and drew my attention away from the main focus. Effy is a really interesting main character and her soft strength makes her stand out from other characters in the genre. But I wanted a bit more from her character development and from the other characters. I did not expect Effy to overcome all of her trauma in such a short book. The way she slowly built trust with Preston was really beautiful. But then she had a very sudden character shift at the very, very end of the story that felt really random. Preston is a cardboard cutout of a character whose only personality trait was being the one not shitty man in this entire story. I love his type of character so the fact that I thought he was boring says a lot. The dedication to this book reads: “This is a love story” and, respectfully, no it's not. I am not one to complain about a fantasy book having too little romance, but this dedication really sets the wrong expectations for the book. Effy and Preston’s romance is incredibly underdeveloped and is certainly not “rivals to lovers.” The entire conflict between them is Effy’s one-sided anger over something kind of stupid. Then she gets over it, they have a few scenes that were probably supposed to have romantic tension, and suddenly they're together. My final critique is that the ending felt a bit awkward. The issue of the Faerie King is resolved way too easily, especially given everything he represents and what a significant figure he was in Effy’s life. The mystery was glaringly obvious from the second it was introduced. Which is fine. This is a YA novel and I can accept some level of in-world explanation for Effy and Preston’s ignorance. But it was really strange how the story walked the reader through each individual element of the reveal in one sit-down conversation. That amount of hand-holding for the reader was completely unnecessary as the mystery was extremely simple and it made the ending feel stilted and unnatural. Amidst an excellent gothic atmosphere, A Study in Drowning gave me glimpses of untapped potential that left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. Unfortunately, I think this is my least favorite Ava Reid so far. I will probably stay away from any of their future YA releases but I would happily read more books along the lines of Juniper and Thorn. I would highly recommend this book to fans of Divine Rivals.Thank you NetGalley and HarperCollins for the eARCLinks to my TikTok | Instagram

5953392568	Haunting and elegantly rendered, A STUDY IN DROWNING is a lyrical examination of stories told, cherished myths, and an unraveling of truths held dear. Darkly romantic and unsettlingly eerie, I will be thinking about this book for a long time to come.

6091403387	"But if fairies and monsters were real, so were the women who defeated them." Equal parts whimsical and haunting, where the narrator blurs the line between fact and fiction. The prose was beautiful (frequent highlighting was happening all throughout.) During my reading experience, I continued to think "This sounds like Jane Eyre with perverts." Not to discredit either book, because I admire them both. But the story is certainly unsettling, as the word drowning in the title is interpreted as a metaphor for the psychological effects of trauma - specifically trauma inflicted on young, vulnerable girls by older men. My one note is that I don't think it necessarily needed the romantic subplot. Some stories are better left without. (Although I did have a little swoon when I saw that he wrote her name over and over 🤭)If you enjoy a gothic atmosphere, generally good writing, and a plot that deals with heavy topics this one is worth the read. What is a mermaid but a woman half-drowned, What a selkie but an unwilling wife, What a tale but a sea-net, snatching up both From the gentle tumult of dark waves?

5785670196	4.25 stars “It began as all things did: a girl on the shore, terrified and desirous.”Unfortunately not this review though. This review is actually beginning in an old rocking chair next to a window while it’s raining outside which is actually very fitting considering this book is about drowning.Anyway, this wonderful little story follows a young architecture student named Effy Sayre who lives in some far off magical island (think 1940s Guernsey but with fae and spirits) and has some issues. First of all, Effy kind of sucks at architecture but can’t go study off at the literature college (specifically fairytales) because she’s a woman. Second, Effy sees things she can’t explain and has to take these pink pills to sleep (don’t worry, it’s probably not drugs…). Third, Effy is constantly sexually harassed and was recently abused by one of her professors (this is awful, we’ll talk more abt it later). Basically, Effy kind of hates her life so when she sees this offer to go patch up some dead guy’s (who happens to be her favorite author of fairy tales) house on the other side of the country, she’s all in. Oh, and did I mention that her country is at war? So Effy goes off to this place called Hiraeth (spelling is hard) and meets this lovely writer (and literature student from her rival country) named Roman Kitt. Or, no. His name is actually Preston Heloury, sorry. So right off the bat Effy doesn’t really like this guy but that’s okay because we love enemies (?) to lovers especially in a dark academia setting. Long story short, Effy and Preston end up finding lots of secrets about this depressing rich guy’s mansion on a hill and… now we have a book (if you couldn’t tell).Anyway, the book was so much fun and very atmospheric. The world building was nice but that was the only place where I thought it was lacking some. Technically Effy’s country was supposed to be at war with Preston’s home country but that wasn’t even mentioned very much except for when Effy (and others) were hating on Preston for being Argantian. I did really love the vibe though and it was nice to have a book with fae that didn’t include young human girls falling in love with hot fae men with bat wings. Speaking of the romance, it was so good. Kind of similar to Divine Rivals (if I haven’t made that abundantly clear) yet maybe not as much a focus to the main storyline. I also really loved how Ava Reid used this relationship to give Effy some healing from her passed sexual abuse which was a big underlying theme throughout the book (trigger warning). Characters were lovely although I would’ve liked to see a little bit more backstory on Preston and maybe some of the side characters too. In the end, I loved it and think that it’s probably even better than my other favorite fantasy standalone A Sorcery of Thorns (although better world building there). Perfect weekend read and extra points for those feminist themes. 4.25 stars.🎶 cardigan 🎶
5461562006	hey siri play "mad woman" by taylor swifti loved this book so much. first – the atmosphere. this book was drenched in atmosphere. the sea-spray, rotting cliffs, collapsing stone walls, gothic darkness, murky waters, drowning, drowning, drowning... it's written gorgeously. ava reid's writing is so beautiful.and the story itself is beautiful, too. it tackles themes like rape culture, misogyny, and whose stories are told in history, but it doesn't get preachy or prioritize its themes over the characters or story. effy sayre is a lovable protagonist – a broken girl, taken advantage of by society, doubting her own sanity, doing everything she can to stay above water, always looking for her next escape. it was a joy to read her story of strengthening, of learning to see herself clearly, of creating a foundation on which to build her life.effy's prey-instinct survival and escapist tendencies are balanced perfectly by the infuriatingly rational, surprisingly kind young man that effy is forced to collaborate with – preston héloury. i loved preston and effy together so much. i absolutely despise broody, possessive, "you're mine" kinds of love interests in books, and preston is nowhere near that. he's incredibly respectful, kind, and sweet, and i love how he's so soft with effy. his literary passion was adorable and also a cool element of his character. he kind of reminds me of a slightly less sanctimonious, more allosexual version of emmett from the little thieves series by margaret owen, which is absolutely a compliment.their relationship was so sweet. it wasn't too sudden, they had great banter, and i could feel the chemistry. but it took a backseat to effy's trauma, to the ocean-soaked world, to the fairy king and the mystery of myrddin and the blur between reality and fairytale. i think it was all balanced excellently.so, why wasn't this a five-star? the plot was rather predictable, and although it wasn't intended to be a crazy, twisty kind of plot, that aspect wasn't outstanding. also, i would've liked to know more about llyr and argant and why they were at war, and to delve deeper into effy's prejudice against argantians and really dissect both her prejudice and how she learned to see past it to the truth.but all in all, this was a wonderful standalone fantasy with lovable characters, a gorgeous writing style, an intense ocean-gothic (is that a thing? now it is) atmosphere and an exploration of rape culture. i highly recommend it.

5853888633	4 stars🌟🌟🌟🌟 this was everything i could want from a gothic, atmospheric, feminist story. this is THE fall book to read.
5852996041	REREAD - This book read even better second time around = bumping it up to a full 5 🌟 Bring on the sequel 🙇🏻‍♀️ ——————————————————-4.5 🌟 Love love LOVED this super eerie and mysterious YA novelFULL REVIEW bellow 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼 🌟🌟🌟🌟💫“When man fall into the sea, they drown. When women meet the water, they transform. It becomes vital to ask: is this a metamorphosis, or a homecoming?”I was honestly confused whether this was fantasy or reality (and still am lol) 😂 I think it was because Effy has always believed in fairy tales, so much so she convinces the reader, or maybe just me, that they are real. Since childhood she was haunted by dreams of the fairy king whom she says ‘represents the very epitome of humanity, in all its viciousness and vulgar fragility.’. The only place she found comfort was in the pages of Angharad, which is an epic about a mortal girl who falls in love with the Fairy King before destroying him. Effy has read and re-read it constantly since childhood and brings her worn out copy to her first semester at a prestigious college where she studies architecture. During her first year at the college, the author’s family announce a contest to design his house!!!!! Effy knows this is her DESTINY and she wins the prize to complete this impossible task. The descriptions of the lead up to the house and the surrounding grounds are very similar to how Daphne du maurier described the landscape in Rebecca, except this estate is more decrepit and crumbling by the minute. I loved the gothic mystery setting - it was perfectly executed! And saying that, Ava’s writing in general was fantastic especially for a debut novel. I was extremely impressed throughout the novel. She also finds another character who has found a temporary home at this house; Preston Heloury. He is a young literature scholar who is studying Myddin’s papers. The two start off as rivals but through investigations of the crumbling house, soon become friends, piecing clues together to discover deep dark secrets of the buildings and those who have called it home. The question is will they get away with it or will it bring them to ruin, as the fairy tale says: “I will love you to ruination.” And will this be a rivals to lovers story?Meanwhile, Effy fights her own internal battles and “She was far more concerned about the things she could only see out of the corner of her eye, the voices she heard when no one else was listening.”. These internal mental battles of hers added yet another layer to the overall dark academia genre of the book. Plus Effy’s vulnerability shows a soft and intimate side to her character. I found both Effy and Preston to both be very likeable characters which made the book even more exciting and compelling to read, particularly in the second half. Furthermore, despite the seriousness of many of the scenes there were a few funny moments that I totally connected with. Many of these showed a feminist side to the novel including comments such as as: “How come all the spiders are men?””Because then it feels more satisfying to squish them.”Overall, I really enjoyed this read. It wasn’t at all what I was expecting but it was a pleasant surprise. My favourite thing about this book was the atmosphere Ava created. I love gothic literature and dark academia and Ava seemed to create something in the middle. The plot flowed at a perfect pace, allowing the reader to take in all the various elements that made up the mystery. My only slight criticism is that it was marginally too long but not by much. Brilliant book that is far deeper than the synopsis can ever explain.
5935762610	I was addicted to the themes and the dark academia of it all, I just felt the story was predictable. However, the prose was BEAUTIFUL. As a fantasy lover, even I get a bit bored if the descriptions of setting feel overdone or excessive, but her writing had me enthralled! I wish we got a little more background for Effy and Preston’s characters besides what was included, but it was enough to drive the story forward and keep me interested in their fate. Overall, this is a 3.25 star read and Reid’s writing style is definitely for me!
5953392611	”I will love you to ruination.” THIS. This is why I love fantasy. The symbolism, the message, the emotion put into this story… no words. Not to mention the atmosphere?! I’ve never read anything as unique as this. Thank you Ava Reid for writing such a powerful story of being reborn.And that last sentence?! Shook. 😯Easily added to my list of favorites this year!
5772616128	Out now! “You don’t have to take up a sword. Survival is bravery too”Thank you Ava Reid, I’ve felt seen.I am truly impressed with this book, it was very different and had much more depth than I was expecting.”It was an eternal feeling, this sense of being unwelcome. No matter where she was, Effy was always afraid she was not wanted.”I entered into A Study in Drowning expecting a fantasy novel based on folklore and mid 20th century England/ Wales, happening in a dark academia setting with a bit of mystery to move story forward. We’ve get all this, and it is great. However, what I feel this books accomplishes best, is describing and validating experiences of abuse (sexual and parental abuse) and panic, dealing with trauma, misogyny and sexism, and finding agency and a new sense of self.The prose is expertly crafted, giving a murky feeling to the story, and easily showing what I imagine to be the feeling of drowning. My senses were overwhelmed with the descriptions from the start until the end.I’ve felt the romance was a bit rushed, especially given the circumstances. However, I believe it was an important piece of the healing process and I wouldn’t change the length of the book. As a fantasy, I wished we had a bit more worldbuilding and context regarding the hate, war and the drownings. A map would have been nice as well, I don’t know if the final version has it or not. I enjoyed it and I wish I had the opportunity to read something like this when I was younger. I wish Effy was less relatable and that her experiences were conscripted to the past. However, this is still an accurate reality, fairytale beauty or not. I’m glad this is going to be on Illumicrate box and that I get to have a pretty Edition of it. I would like to thanks The Fairy King, Random House UK, Cornerstone, Del Rey and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this ARC in exchange for an honest review.TW - sexual harassment, sexual and parental abuse, panic attacks, mental illness, sexism, misogyny, death of a parent
8011824858	a study in mediocrity
5784788501	✔️dark academia with evil professors✔️gothic horror in the rotting ruin of a once stately mansion✔️ adversaries to allies romance 🌶️Yup it's in there and this was the scariest book I read this year, including those advertised as Horror.The world building was a bit of a mess. The heroine cries more than any character I've encountered in years and she has a palpable anxiety disorder, just to warn you. Lots of poetry. Lots of discussions of literature. Lots of really miserable, cold, damp weather Based on the above, I can see some readers hating this book. I could see some readers DNF-ing this around 25%. I could see other readers hating the characters or the world (or both.) There is lots of misogyny. There is little representation.The writing however is outstanding and I enjoyed it.
7694592622	Une romantasy captivante .Je ne connaissais pas cette autrice mais j’ai beaucoup aimé sa plume. Ce roman est un mélange de plusieurs genre nous avons de la romance dans un décor tout droit sorti d’un manoir gothique au bord d’une falaise, un mystère à résoudre et une ambiance dark academia. Ce fut une lecture agréable et facile. Je recommande à tous les fans de romantasy.
6231536314	Absolutely fantastic. I think this book is underrated and mis-marketed. I have a lot of thoughts on this book but most would be a spoiler so...My spoiler-free thoughts are this...This is a dark, academia, atmospheric fantasy novel, that yes, does have a romantic subplot but this book explores a real world topic in a unique way. I absolutely loved the vibes and thought the parallel the author draws between said topic and (that one character) was really well done. Again for those in the back (imho)This is not a romantasy - yes there is a romance and yes its fantasy but the romance is such a small portion of this book and not the main theme. The only thing I wished I'd known before going into this book is that it is pretty heavy and should have a SA trigger warning.Reread via audio May25: Just as good. I think I enjoyed the romance a bit more this time. Narrator did a great job!4.5⭐️ | IG | TikTok |
6888250319	Beautiful, with well-written protagonists and an interesting plot. The perfect book to read as a university student in the fall 🍂
5140138029	4/5 The mariner's hubris isn't necessarily in his belief that he won't die, but his belief that the worst the sea can do is kill him. Thank you Del Rey for providing me with an arc in exchange for an honest review.I enjoyed this book immensely, this is my first Ava Reid book and I cannot wait to read their adult works as well. The writing in this book was astoundingly beautiful. Every word bleeds with emotion, I kept stopping so that I could admire the words I was reading in depth.It's an incredibly atmospheric book, every moment feels alive, as if the wind will wrench you from this world and place you anew upon the cliffs. Every creak of the dilapidated house, every lash of rain on the characters' cheeks, it was all so vivid. The writing was truly phenomenal. The sea took and took and took, thousands of little deaths, and they endured it all because they knew nothing else. They didn't think to fear the Drowning until the water was lapping at their door. I adored the themes throughout the story. I could tell where the story was heading and was correct in my theories, and I loved how these darker themes were explored both delicately and deeply. The exploration of misogyny of all kinds—of the commodification of women, of women's roles within stories and the roles women have played within mythologies and folklore—was fascinating. I loved how intrinsically this exploration was paired with the folklore of the world, I loved how connected they were to the various stories within stories. But didn't all drownings begin with a harmless dribble of water? Our main character, Effy, loves the book 'Angharad' more than anything, it connects with her on a level deeper than the male scholars could ever possibly understand. It's a story that sings to her truth, it provides her shelter and comfort from the storm of her reality, and it gives her courage to rewrite her own history. I think every book lover can relate to the feeling of having that one book that speaks to you, that one story that feels like it was written just for you (mine is He Who Drowned the World by Shelley Parker-Chan). This story will appeal to you if you like books about books, but it is also so much more than that. It's quite a difficult book to summarise as it explores so many different themes, with great nuance, that are interwoven with such complexity. It's also, on the surface, a mystery (or, at least, very mysterious) and so I fear saying too much in case I give something away. But at its heart this book is about the characters.Effy is the perfect main character to follow, she's vibrant and brave and rears up against the forced narrative she is often shunted in, yet she is also scared and vulnerable, succumbing to the waves of the never-ending sea, swallowing down the salt water of her fears and drowning in the very place the world's narrative has left her. Her story is a constant battle; for sanity, for peace, for autonomy, for freedom, for greatness. It often appears that the entire world is against her, but she finds an undaunted strength within herself that she wields to face each struggle. I loved watching Effy grow throughout the story. You don't have to take up a sword. Survival is bravery, too. I did like how soft and sweet the romance in this book was and I did like the other character in the romance a lot, however I was never as gripped by this aspect I was by many of the others. But I did appreciate how caring and gentle and always kind it was, I thought it a brilliant contrast to the cruelty of the surrounding world and characters. She wondered if you could love something out of ruination, reverse that drowning process, make it all new again. I'm incredibly excited to read Ava Reid's other works (I've been wanting to read Juniper and Thorn for so long)! I'm interested to see how much this book differs from their usual writing and storytelling as A Study in Drowning is YA whereas their other works are adult. I can see how a lot of the themes within this book could be taken and explored in darker and more gory ways. I absolutely cannot wait to read more! Centuries later, it was the stuff of fairy tales and legends, as if no conquest had ever occurred. As if whole villages had not been slaughtered in a quest to eradicate those unseemly traditions. As if stories were not spoils of war.
6566387532	4.5/5 stars I love Gothic novels so much, and this one did a fantastic job of capturing the spirit of the genre! Reid skilfully and compellingly depicts the settings and ideas that are iconic to the Gothic genre, from the big, eerie, crumbling home to the loneliness of the Myrddin family to the vastness and peril of the sea. Reid goes one step further, incorporating myths, poetry, magic, and stories focused around faeries into this Gothic tale and viewing it all through a feminist lens.The plot takes a while to get going, and some of the plot points are a little too predictable but, the book doesn't aim for shocking twists. Instead, its strength lies in its layered narrative, unexpectedly delving into profound themes like institutional sexism, abuse of power by men, and the myriad ways in which women have been marginalized and silenced to conform to powerful men's narratives. It explores the dynamics of storytelling, examining the roles of authors and readers, and how narratives shape personal and national identities. Ultimately, the novel questions the repercussions of shattered identities and underscores the power of stories in defining our sense of self. These themes are explored with a touch of magical realism, blurring the boundaries between reality and fiction, adding depth beyond my initial expectations.It is obvious that a great deal of attention went into creating this world. There is a religion system based on folklore and the deification of famous artists, there is war between Effy and Preston's countries, and there is a terrible history of vast tracts of land being abruptly engulfed by the sea. Even while I like each of these arenas separately, I still felt like I could have gotten a little bit more from them altogether. Since this is never really addressed in the story, I'm not exactly clear what function the warring nations played. Even if the religion and folklore were given more consideration, towards the end I still had some unanswered questions.I found Effy to be deeply relatable; she grapples with mental health challenges, battling anxiety by retreating into her beloved stories to cope with trauma. Her journey of self-discovery and healing unfolds beautifully, revealing her growth. I also think that the character of Effy is resonating with a lot of people, because she exists as an outsider both in society and within her own life. She stands apart from typical Young Adult protagonists as she’s not characterized by her sarcastic remakes or how strong she is, but rather, she embodies resilience as a survivor. Her relationship with Preston was very adorable, but I wouldn't say it's rivals-to-lovers because they're not really rivals, and Effy's initial hate is largely unwarranted and essentially the result of her prejudice. However, I really enjoyed how they developed over the narrative and how I began to care about them as a couple because I enjoyed their banter and exchanges, particularly when they had intimate and vulnerable times together. So, if you go into this book expecting rivals to lovers, I think you’ll be disappointed.In the end, A Study in Drowning is a brilliantly written, suspenseful, and poignant novel that offers its audience an endlessly readable blend of historical fiction, gothic mystery, and fantasy romance that will captivate you time and time again.
5881580532	“𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞, 𝐭𝐨 𝐧𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐚 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮.”This book.I honestly don't know where to begin or what to say because it exceeded all my expectations.I've been excited about it since I found out it's part of my September box from Illumicrate, and I'm so glad I decided to read it right away. A Study in Drowning has everything a dark academia fan would want in a book - poetry, a crumbling mansion, two students with strong opinions, superstitions, and a little bit of magic. I've been invested from the very beginning.Effy and Preston don't get along at first, and there's even a bit of rivalry going on, but they work past that very quickly, and from then on, it only gets better. The powerful feminist vibes and Effy's background story were a surprise but one I immensely welcomed. It gave the book so much more meaning.It rightly deserves its spot on my all-time favorites list, and I will undoubtedly come back for a reread.
5953392637	** spoiler alert ** Once again an Ava Reid book sounds like it will be a 100% Perfect Fit for me, and once again there are some things about the final product that I really love but a number of others that just don't quite work for me.The element that I have the most to say about is here definitely the romance. For starters, I would reeeeeally hesitate to categorize this as enemies-to-lovers. For the first third of the book, Effy is just petty, spiteful and rude to Preston because he represents everything that she is being denied at college due to gender discrimination and Preston just kind of…takes it. She also makes a number of prejudiced/stereotyped comments about him being part Argantian (from the country that her country is currently at war with). My problem with this, to be clear, is not just that it *happens*. I’m fine with a story where a character who has been through a lot lashes out at someone who it’s safe to lash out at! Where it fails to work for me, though, is the way that the relationship then randomly and kind of awkwardly transitions from all the nasty, petty sniping to what is clearly supposed to be a deeply delicate, tender and respectful romance that is all about trauma sensitivity and support.Effy apologizes to Preston eventually, but for me it feels like far too little, too late because the relationship has already inexplicably developed way past the enemies-to-lovers point without any of it being addressed. Also, his responses to her apologies are really bizarre and funny? She’s like “Uh, sorry that I was deeply unkind to you without knowing you at all and continuously stereotyped your identity in the most uncharitable way possible. I guess that was kind of awful of me.” And then he’s just like “No, babe, [One Direction voice] I wish you could see yourself the way that I see you. You were just challenging me intellectually (note: that is definitely not all she was doing lol) and also I know you’ve been stereotyped too as a girl at college.” That element of Effy’s own prejudice is never meaningfully unpacked, and while it could have been a great chance to look at how someone struggling with their own oppression can still judge and hurt others in similar ways (and may even do so because of how they are being hurt just like Effy does at the start!), it just doesn’t quite ever go there. Otherwise, the romance is more substantial than the one in Juniper & Thorn, but another big problem for me is that Preston just seems so vague and lifeless - I never really felt a true sense of what made him distinct or complex or interesting as a character at all. He’s a cynic who loves talking about his academic theories and he is kind and respectful to Effy when literally every other man in the book is a lascivious slobbering monster. There is one scene where he tells Effy about his father’s death, and that’s pretty much the most significant spotlight moment that he gets throughout the book. The other thing that I feel obligated to mention about the romance is that Effy and Preston choose the absolute worst time possible to have sex and then leisurely whisper sweet nothings/ fall asleep afterwards!!!! There is a terrifying weirdo skulking around a house that’s being ripped apart by a massive sea storm, and if they don’t drive away quickly enough, the roads will wash out and they’ll be stuck with said terrifying weirdo and said house that’s being ripped apart by a massive sea storm!! And they just have sex and peacefully fall asleep with all this going on!!! (Edit: also I'm perpetually haunted by Preston saying "I'll be kind to you" pre-sex. HAUNTED I SAY) In conclusion: while there were certainly some sweet moments, the romance really, really did not work for me overall. Effy’s perspective as a trauma survivor and someone struggling with intense mental health issues is viscerally depicted in a way that definitely feels extremely raw, powerful and familiar to me. This was one of my favorite things about Juniper & Thorn, and it absolutely stands here, too. You really feel her sense of ever-present anxiety, how every moment precariously teeters on the verge of panic and disaster. She constantly doubts what she experiences and blames and denigrates herself because that is what the world has done to her as it has forced to her survive through misogyny and abuse. While she ends the book in a place that is empowered and moving towards healing and happiness and I LOVE that, I do wish that those changes could have emerged more gradually over the course of the book. I don’t really feel that there is much of a substantial developmental arc in this direction until she dives for the hidden chest and then defeats the Fairy King (quick detour to say that the final reveal/confrontation with the Fairy King happens and then resolves soo incredibly quickly! [Edit 2: honestly, the more I think about everything with the Fairy King, the less sense it all makes and the more disappointing it is]). In fact, what arc there is seems to be largely about her deciding not to trust/believe in herself until she suddenly finds out that the Fairy King is real. The book also states explicitly during the climax that her romance with Preston is the thing that primarily changes her and gives her something to fight for, which isn't a trope that I love but ymmv.I predicted the plot twist about Angharad’s authorship in either the first or second chapter but I’m undecided about whether I should pat myself on the back for that since it’s a YA mystery!!! I do really, really, really love the eventual outcome with Angharad becoming free after a lifetime of fighting and entrapment and the truth of her authorship finally out in the world. Effy is able to break the cycle of women’s lives and stories getting taken over by ruthless men, and both women are able to move into the future with hope and autonomy and power. You just KNOW that’s Charlotte Catnip, and the final pages of the book absolutely made me all weepy and heart-full. There’s a bit where Angharad says this: “I wanted one girl, only one, to read my book and feel that she was understood, and I would be understood in return.” It’s a beautiful line and a beautiful message - it’s one that fully resonates for me, and I would be surprised if Angaharad wasn’t speaking a bit for Reid in this moment too. A Study in Drowning is definitely a “love letter to books” book and I can feel the author’s passion in showing how stories can help us survive reality and how important it is for us to be able to truly own our stories and voices. As for the writing itself, I stand by what I said in my review of Juniper & Thorn: I mostly think Reid’s language is quite strong and evocative. But MY GOD there is a crazy amount of repetition that totally could have been edited out. You could die of alcohol poisoning halfway through the book if you decided to take a shot every time Effy blushes - I swear I’m not exaggerating when I say that I noticed it happening almost every page. Preston is also quite the blusher as the romance kicks into gear. As far as the similes and metaphors go, there seem to be a lot less semi-questionable ones here than there were in Juniper & Thorn, but there are still quite a lot of them. I don’t know the actual Rules of Good Prose but my general feeling is that an author’s writing should always try to serve the story, so if it’s repetitive or jarring enough to break immersion, it might not be doing its job as well as possible. Who knows if I’m right about that though ha ha! I don’t think it’s up for debate that this book is absolutely dripping with atmosphere, and I think that is another place where Reid truly excels. You’ve got crumbling cliffside manors, waterlogged chests, secret rooms, cryptic hidden journals, melancholic poetry, isolated villages, the raging sea, wicked fairies, thick sweaters, foggy roads, pounding rain, hot drinks and pie - everything a girl could want as far as vibes go. At least for me, though, too many other things just didn’t land quite right, and I’m genuinely sad to say that.
5784511745	I will love bore you to ruination.One star because I was able to finish it after all.One star because of the cover.And one more star because it really carries its name. Seriously. Bravo. The whole book felt like drowning. Not because of the setting or the world, but because it was so dull I felt like I was drowning. Three stars in total.Welcome to another episode of ‘Cyra is never satisfied!’ In today’s episode, I’ll trash this book!I will start by saying this book tackles some incredibly heavy yet equally important topics. These are the topics almost every woman faces each and every day in our world. So, kudos to the author for shining light on them as well as handling them with respect and sincerity. If there is a reason for me not to DNF this book after failing to finish it in almost two months, it’s this. The quote, “You don’t have to take up a sword. Survival is bravery, too.” alone is a very valid reason to pick up this book as it can be moving to so many of us.The author clearly cared deeply about this book and the characters within it. The love she poured into her work was notable and admirable on every page. I will definitely be following her work from now on. But anyway, let’s be real. This book has hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews, talking about how this work changed the trajectory of their lives and how Jesus saved humanity so this masterpiece could be born. But you are not reading those, you are reading this review. So now, why I disliked this book! *cue the applause*I would put a spoiler warning here but everything in this book was just so damn predictable that you’ll spoil everything for yourself if you are as smart as a sponge. (Jokes aside this portion is spoiler-free, you are safe!)This book was so focused on the message it was trying to get across it sacrificed the depth and the characters along the way. I couldn’t get myself to like Effy or care for her. I feel for her deeply as I can relate to her about her experiences but that’s about it. She was nothing but her traumas. She had no character and she did not have a development at all. The same goes for the love interest, Preston.Speaking of Preston… He was so bland he could make white bread seem interesting. Seriously. Reading about him made me feel as empty as Bella Swan in New Moon. You know what scene I’m talking about, There’s a possibiliiiiiiiity…And those two… First of all, they weren’t “academic rivals to lovers.” They were ‘I’ll dislike you for the dumbest reason because the plot needs it’ to ‘fuck it, let’s make out.’ The disgrace! Honestly, I am pretty sure I hated the first part of the book especially because I couldn’t wrap my head around why Effy was being petty literally over nothing! Now I understand romance took a backseat in this story because it was a rather less important topic. My issue is how the author not only put it on the backseat but drove the car to a tree before setting it on fire. Chemistry? Nope. Tension? Fuck no. Sparks? How dare you speak of such a thing.I’m a firm believer that they fell in love because they were like rabbits in spring and the only option was to either hump on each other or one of the rotten columns of the house. You can’t convince me that these two liked each other. I actually liked the world and myths but it’s mostly because I hardly understood anything so I kind of went with the whole vibe. Also, I believe there was a war going on, which is very irrelevant to the story anyway so I couldn’t care less about it. It was one of those things added to create a more complex setting but was forgotten at the end. Despite what I said earlier, I am not a dick, and I don’t want to be hunted down by the readers, so I will indeed put a spoiler warning for this paragraph despite the fact that even a person with severe astigmatism could see it from miles away. So Ianto turns out to be the Fairy King, which was no surprise at all. I really would’ve been surprised if he turned out not to be the Fairy King. It was just so obvious that I figured we all already knew that he was in fact the Fairy King from the beginning, so when Effy was shocked, I was shocked too because girl? How could you not see that coming? Preston does not need glasses, you do!Anyway, I can still go on and on about my issues with this book but I won’t tell you not to read this book as it seems like it worked out well for many readers and even though the main character has an IQ level of a pot, it is somehow empowering. If a girl like that, who I suspect would touch the boiling water to know if it was indeed boiling, can survive the world and do good, so can you!
7059668082	My soul feels wrinkly and puny, as if I was just soaking in the ocean for too long and I’m now lying on the beach to dry. I had this weird urge to quietly weep the entire time I read this. Just little tears welling in the back of my eyes for seemingly no reason. But I almost think that was the point of the melancholy melodic, lyrical writing.This book is written in a way that makes you feel like the author is not just taking you on a journey. She is on your back for a piggyback ride, holding your chin in her freshly painted nails, guiding your chin left right up and down, forcing your nose into the flowers . Shoving your face into clear pools of water so that you might see the reflection of your trauma back at you. Whispering in your ear intrinsic therapy sessions between the pages and yourself. And there’s more to it there are two stories here three if you count the one that you go on with yourself. One is a story about a book and two students uncovering the truth with fairies and magic and what not but that’s not really the core of the story core of the story is about women, and the love letter between authors and readers, and also a profound ballot of love to the sea and all of these things become one, subtly and not so subtly woven between lines of fiction and nonfiction. I just feel like I want people to read this, but I also don’t think you should read this unless you have a therapist on standby at the same time. I also have never annotated such deeply personal things in a book before but I had some things I had written years past that fit so well between the margins giving a resting place for feelings that once haunted me I don’t usually read books quite on this side of the scale of fantasy because while they are perfectly well written, almost too perfect I almost feel like the author does not leave room for the readers own imagination. TWs - SA (not described but very present in the story)- child abuse (not violent but still heavy)
5732592797	Ava Reid, you’ve gained a new fan with this book.I had my copy sitting on the shelf for months, and I can't believe I waited so long to read it. I had been missing out on Ava Reid’s captivating world of beautiful writing.This book is filled with exquisite prose and incredibly vivid, atmospheric descriptions. As someone who loves gothic novels, I’m often disappointed by modern attempts that miss the mark. But Reid gets it. She understands the very essence of gothic fiction. The grand manor on the dark, stormy hill, the brooding weather, the eerie inhabitants, the mysterious visions of the protagonist, the supernatural elements, and, of course, the romance—all of it is perfectly executed.While the main plot is somewhat predictable, what truly elevates this novel are the layers of depth woven through it. It’s emotional, melancholic, and yet has a sweet, satisfying ending that ties everything together beautifully.At the heart of the story is Effy, the protagonist, grappling with the question of her own sanity. Her visions and experiences are constantly dismissed by others, and eventually, she begins to doubt herself. Effy’s internal struggle—her fight to hold onto reality while doubting her own mind—is deeply heartbreaking. The novel explores themes of isolation, being misunderstood, and feeling alone in a way that resonates on an emotional level.One of the most powerful aspects of Reid’s writing is how she portrays the idea of self-doubt. When Effy's reality is questioned and dismissed, she begins to second-guess her own experiences. Reid masterfully captures the creeping feeling of uncertainty, likening it to slowly drowning without realizing it until it’s too late.The prose is stunning, offering a beautiful reading experience on every page. From start to finish, I was immersed in the haunting atmosphere and transported into a world of dark beauty. If I had one critique, it would be that it took me a little time to fully connect with Effy. Her emotions and inner turmoil are central to the novel, but I didn’t feel that strong emotional bond with her right away, which made the beginning feel slower. However, as the story progressed, that hesitation faded, and I became completely engrossed in her journey.If you love a dark, beautifully written gothic novel, this book is an excellent choice.
5015514769	me, humming that one line from all too well 10-minute version: f♥ck the patriarchy
5921680010	Wow, what a painful struggle to finish. I'm stubborn, so I forced myself to read the whole thing, but by god, I hated it. Effie's racism dies down by the end of the book after she realizes she's being, you know, racist- but it feels less like she's done so out of the goodness of her heart and moreso that she's doing so specifically because she "fell in love with one of the savages" as it were. And it takes forever for her to get there. So much of her initial dislike stems from the fact that she thinks she deserves the position he has as a literature student. And not because of the obvious sexism in being denied for being a woman. Rather, she thinks she deserves his spot because obviously a Llyrian like her deserves it more than an Argantian like him, and Argantians can't truly appreciate the works of a Llyrian author. And you have to hear about her thinly veiled racism for like half the book. So I really couldn't get behind Preston and Effie as a romance. As a main character, Effie is just annoying as hell to read about. On the one hand, I feel bad for her due to the sexism and parental abuse she's faced. On the other hand, she drives me nuts for reasons I can't quite figure out. Maybe it's the way she spends 90% of the book so paralyzed with fear that she does nothing, and the other 10% acting in the most insane ways imaginable that's only tolerable because it moves along the plot. Also, I have to say, I spent the majority of the book wondering if magic and the fairy king was real or not, and not in a fun way. Effie's constantly swallowing pink pills to fight off hallucinations and nightmares, and combined with her tremulous mental state, it doesn't paint the picture of someone telling a story I would believe. Perhaps that's part of the point, and this book just wasn't for me.

5682790202	‼️‼️‼️‼️maybe (definitely) my favourite Ava ReidThank you DelRey / The Fairy King for the ARC!A Study in Drowning is, not an exaggeration, a masterpiece. I’ve been an Ava Reid fan since The Wolf and the Woodsman but their newest instalment has made it extremely obviously that she will forever be one of my favourite authors. Their ability to meld together folklore, tender romance, a truly gripping plot and a nuanced portrayal of trauma and recovery is absolutely masterful. A Study in Drowning hit me right in the stomach, drawing up feelings around growing up as a girl trying to proof herself, of wishing to take up space, and of navigating the dangerous waters of who to trust— including yourself.Drawing from Welsh folklore, ASID follows the story of Effy, a young student of architecture, though her true passion lies in literature even if the school doesn’t permit women. When she gets the chance to design a home for her favourite author Myrddin‘s son at their ancestral home, she jumps at the chance despite her fear of what she might uncover while she’s there. At Hiraeth, Effy encounters a smug and mercurial fellow academic, a boy called Preston, and Myrddin’s son. Soon, Effy and Preston join forces to investigate the mysterious author’s legacy, especially around Effy’s favourite story Angharad, or the story of a young woman and the fabled Fairy King. As Effy and Preston draw closer to the truth and myth comes to life, they realise the origin to the story might be far closer than they ever could’ve imagined.Gothic and sea worn, Hiraeth provided a wonderful backdrop to the story and added a great sense of foreboding reminiscent of some of the best ‘house’ novels I’ve ever read. The Welsh scenery really came through and I liked the modern touches as well. Ava is truly talented at creating atmosphere and driving up the tension with the environment. I loved Effy and Preston’s story, and Effy’s slow acceptance that she was indeed in a romance. She’s anxious and soft, eager to please and desperate to be understood. I resonated with her so much and she’s made her way to one of my favourite characters of all time.Like all of Ava’s work, ASID is raw and vulnerable, dark but yet carrying an unassailable torch of light that leaves you feeling hopeful at the end of it. I absolutely adored this story and feel truly honoured to continue to see how Ava develops as an author!
6453143419	Doy mi opinión sincera siempre desde el respeto, eso por delante. No ha sido para mí. Para NADA. En absoluto. Me ha costado horrores acabarlo y cada vez que intentaba avanzar me quedaba dormida. Terriblemente soporífero, lento y carente de interés. Siento que si no tiene magia, fantasía o algún elemento que pueda destacar en la trama, a mí ya no me llena. Por lo tanto esta es una opinión totalmente subjetiva y basada en mis gustos fantasiosos. Esta historia no tiene esos elementos. Para mí es que no ha tenido nada relevante 😭😭😭😭También debo decir que de dark academia he visto un 1% como mucho.De ambientación oscura... pues para mi gusto no es oscura, es sin más.Y siento que la autora eligió el título del libro antes de escribirlo, haciendo referencias a ello bastante manidas, como muy "intento de justificar"Lo siento de veras, quería que me gustara el título, la portada, la ambientación prometida... pero no.Lo único bueno que destaco es una defensa feminista en la literatura y el mundo universitario, pero de nuevo me ha parecido muy muy esquematizada y guionizada.
6186249381	i loved the beautiful writing and the setting/vibes. even though i found myself confused and slightly bored for a good portion of the beginning, i just needed to trust the process. once everything started to click for me, i was obsessed and unable to put it down. it really hit me out of nowhere and became one of my fav reads of the year. i adore effy. i felt so bad for her and really formed a deep connection to her character. i think that’s a major factor as to why i kept reading until the story got interesting for me. she’s so strong, yet she still had her struggles. i love how she fought for her place in a world rampant with misogyny. she would’ve been seen as a “hysterical woman” but she still kept pushing and fighting. love her. we really need to bring back yearning! preston is so patient and caring with her and i absolutely adore the way the relationship between them unfolded. the romance was definitely a sub-plot, but sometimes i find that preferable. it makes me appreciate all the little scraps we’re given. Ava Reid’s writing is enchanting. so many stunning quotes. “Well—I was a woman when it was convenient to blame me, and a girl when they wanted to use me.”“She found it funny that he was so preoccupied with the technicalities. Effy’s mind always skipped over those details. She let those small things slough off her; the small things were never what ruined you. If she were kneeling and examining the shells on the beach, she wouldn’t see the titanic wave rising over her head. What sort of things would she wonder about, if she weren’t always waiting for the next wave to come?”“Anything can be taken from you, at any moment. Even the past isn’t guaranteed. You can lose that, too, slowly, like water eating away at stone.”“But if fairies and monsters were real, so were the women who defeated them.”“‘I just wanted to tell you,” he said, “when this is over, I’ll take care of you, too. If you want me to.’”and there’s so many more i could have included. i’ll say it again: i can’t wait to read more of her work. p.s.: if you ever see me complaining about a book before giving it time to cook and then rating it 4-5 stars when i finish it, no you didn’t. i have a tendency to do that and i don’t wanna talk about it.
5330445134	4.5 stars. Containing an examination of the ways in which women have been erased in literature and higher education and an achingly well-written romance, A Study in Drowning is an English major's Gothic dream of a YA, dark academia fantasy.
5863573813	This was an engaging gothic mystery, I was sucked straight into the story, the real feel of dread was great and had me on the edge of my seat for most of the book.The vibes were perfect and eerie especially when I read this at night, I could feel my heart racing and could picture the cliffs, sea and rainy days perfectly.Effy wasn’t a particularly good FMC, she was rude and quite prejudiced towards Preston but this was chalked up to jealousy but it didn’t make it easy to like her. Shes also a unreliable narrator so it had me guessing what was real and what was hallucinations The ending also wasn’t my favourite, it felt too easy, I can’t say more with spoilers But for mystery and vibes alone it was an enjoyable read

This book has been on my tbr for forever, and it didn't disappoint! It did drag at times, but I still liked it a lot. This review is going to be half rant half yap sesh, so lets jump into it hehe :) ◟📜: 𝒲𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝐼 𝒹𝒾𝒹𝓃'𝓉 𝓁𝑜𝓋𝑒 ˎˊ˗ Might I just say how rude and prejudiced Effy is at the beginning of the book? She meets Preston and is like "He's from another country, and he goes to the literature school, so he's my rival and is the reason of all my problems." Like girl stawp what in the discrimination. Like yes, I know the two countries are in a war, but Effy was so prejudiced against Preston because of his ethnicity like what in the hypocrisy. She preaches feminism but then is racism like what???? It lowkey pissed me off so bad when Effy kept bringing up Preston's background, because whyyyyyyyyy does his race matter? Girl stfu (respectfully) Preston does not deserve the hate. But dw she gets redemption. At first the romance between Preston and Effy was a bit forced because Preston is Effy's one sided rival and the whole racist thing and there wasn't really chemistry, but I'll elaborate more on the romance later. The reviews I've read for this book all say that this book is really really boring. I actually disagree. There were times in the book where it was a little boring but not nearly as "deathly boring" as the other reviews say (imo). Some sketchy characters in this book...(view spoiler)[*cough* Ianto being bipolar *cough* (hide spoiler)] Also this girl Effy is lowk brainwashed by hope but I can't blame her..Anyways lets get into the good parts of the book <3 ◟📜: 𝒲𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝐼 𝒹𝒾𝒹 𝓁𝒾𝓀𝑒 ˎˊ˗ I know I complained a bit (lot ooops) about Effy previously, but she got redemption trust. While she was discriminant at the beginning, as she starts to develop a connection with Preston, she does grow and admit her faults. The romance in the book was forced at first but it evolved into something sweet and precious, and I actually really like the relationship between Effy and Preston. Preston is sooo sweet! I also liked the overall plot of the story. Girl goes to crumbling house of recently deceased renowned author to rebuild it and meets a boy from the literature college there. My favorite part of the novel was how the author incorporated fairy tales and a fantasy world crossing into reality. The book revolved around Angharad, a famous fairytale book from A Study in Drowning's world. I loved the references from Angharad into A Study in Drowning. Effy as a person likes to escape reality by reading books, and I, and many other readers, can totally relate to that. She's so real for it. I loved the themes of feminism and speaking up when others try to silence your voice. Those themes, along with the importance and the search for truth, are central themes to this novel. ◟📜: 𝐸𝓍𝓉𝓇𝒶 𝒞𝑜𝓂𝓂𝑒𝓃𝓉𝓈 ˎˊ˗ ᝰ.⋆ For some reason, this book really gives Divine Rivals vibes, although obviously its not as good ᝰ.⋆ Help because that one scene where Preston is trying to be Cardan like 😭 ᝰ.⋆ I actually love the world of this book its so vivid and lush ᝰ.⋆ Effy's arc was sooo good. It's about voice, truth, feminism, and growth. ᝰ.⋆ The writing was atmospheric and lyrical, and the description of scenes was so (for lack of better descriptive words) lush and vivid.

Hoping its not as boring as the reviews say it is!
5478051572	“We must discuss, then, the relationship between women and water. When men fall into the sea, they drown. When women meet the water, they transform. It becomes vital to ask: is this a metamorphosis, or a homecoming?”“I was a woman when it was convenient to blame me, and a girl when they wanted to use me.”“I know you think I am a little girl, and what could a little girl know about eternity? But I do know this: whether you survive the ocean or you don’t, whether you are lost or whether the waves deliver you back to the shore—every story is told in the language of water, in tongues of salt and foam. And the sea, the sea, it whispers the secret of how all things end.”Excuse me while I go and read everything Ava Reid has ever written, because this was phenomenal.
6006387654	“I wished he would be a serpent, a cloven-footed creature, a winged beast—anything but a man.”That quote was the best thing in the book. This is going to be messy so bear with me lol. This was so boring. The chapters were long. Everything was lacking and bland. The ending was so anti-climactic like what was the real point of this Fairy King? Nothing.The fmc, Effy, got on my nerves. She was so shallow and rude to the mmc in the beginning. She was constantly complaining, and whining. This certain character called her a “mewling little girl” and she was lol. I am also NOT talking about the trauma she had when I talk about her whining. In the book we follow her trying to figure out more about her favorite author. The love she had for this author clouded her judgement. Girl it is right in front of you and you still somehow deny it. She refused to believe this author could be a bad person. Even with all the misogynistic things he wrote. I also think Effy is racist. It is a bold claim but hear me out. So there are these two countries which is Llyr and Argant. Apparently the mmc is Argantian. Effy is constantly belittling him, insulting him, and assuming stereotypes. It is repeated on much she doesn't like certain groups of people or people from the country. She literally says at some point him being Argantian is something he can’t change. So why is she still so rude to him? It made me super uncomfortable that I almost dnf’ed. She disrespected him and his country. Constantly saying he can’t do the things he was doing because he was Argantian. Called him a carpetbagger. She never changes her views either or grows. She apologizes but not hugely because he accepted it so easily. She was so icky. The only thing about the mmc, Preston, was the fact that he was scared of everything. I didn't care for him. I do have to say he deserved better. There was no build-up for the romance and randomly they just kissed and said “I love you”.
5924770996	A generous 1.5 stars for pretty cover and for the MMC wearing glasses. This is one of the WORST fantasy books I've ever read. Where was the world building? What is Llyr and Argant? Are they clans? Races? Countries? Cultures? WHAT IS IT? How are you going to write a fantasy book and not build on the world? Not explain the world that you have created? It's lazy, to say the least. Let's talk about the story. Boring, predictable and almost comical. The ending made me laugh because that's all? He died because of a mirror? A normal mirror? The GREAT Fairy King who takes young women away (also, why? Don't you have better things to do?) is defeated because he looked into a mirror? You have got to be joking. At least make it a special KIND of mirror? Lazy again. The ending and the story in general was disappointing and uninteresting. The letters were found UNDER THE BED? It was THAT easy? That was so stupid. Nope. Now the characters. Again, boring and bland. Preston was boring and absolutely nothing about him was interesting except maybe the fact that we were told he is smart and wears glasses. BORING. Effy, oh dear lord, give the girl some justice? how are you gonna give every single problem in the world to her and then not do justice to ANY? Her SA story was really mishandled and the grooming part for her and the other woman was weirdly handled and it just... it felt like she was given this much trauma for the sake of giving her trauma. No justice to any themes. The "mad woman in the attic" which I assume was inspired by Jane Eyre was poorly executed and it was just... weird. The entire book was badly done. The premise was interesting but badly executed. Now, the writing. It wasn't bad, it was actually decent but the story was so bland and stupid that not even the writing could save it.
