2333208391	ARC provided by Tor in exchange for an honest review. “The more you struggle against the Ninth, Nav, the deeper it takes you; the louder you curse it, the louder they’ll have you scream.” Hi, my name is Melanie, and this was a really hard review to write for many reasons. First, I think I have hyped this book for all of 2019, and I have been very vocal about it being my favorite book of the year, and the best debut I’ve ever had the privilege of reading. Next, how do you write a review on the book of your heart? The book that feels like it was crafted for you? The book that has lit up the darkest places of your soul? It’s hard, friends. Truly. Lastly, I know nothing I say here will do this book justice. But I suppose I should give it a try regardless, aye?Gideon the Ninth is a book about a swordfighter named Gideon who is my favorite literary character of all time. Gideon is so witty, so funny, so charming, and such a thorn in Harrowhark’s side. Harrowhark is a necromancer, while also being the main ruler of the Ninth’s planet. Both of these characters are harboring a few secrets of their own, but they are both so unsure of their pasts and their futures for so very many reasons.That is, until one day the Emperor has invited all eight necromancer heirs, from all eight loyal Houses, to compete in unknown trails to possibly ascend into something that will make them immortal, but the costs of losing can very well be their lives. No necromancer can compete without a skilled cavalier by their side, and Harrowhark has no choice but to get Gideon to help her and save the future of the Ninth House. “You are the honoured heirs and guardians of the eight Houses. Great duties await you. If you do not find yourself a galaxy, it is not so bad to find yourself a star, nor to have the Emperor know that the both of you attempted this great ordeal.” But once Gideon and Harrowhark arrive on the Emperor’s planet, they soon realize that the tasks are going to be much more mysterious and much more difficult than anyone could have predicted. Especially when cavaliers and necromancers from the other houses start getting murdered. Gideon is not only tasked to help Harrowhark, she also has to ensure that she keeps breathing herself, while also trying to figure out who is doing the unspeakable things to other competitors.Tamsyn then leads us on this beautiful adventure, where twist after twist occurs so seamlessly that you can’t help but feel completely enthralled. The writing is so beautiful, so intelligent, and so very impressive. And the way the entire story is told is so very transportive! I mean, this book has one of the scariest settings I’ve read all year, but I felt like I was right there battling for my life, with a goofy smile on my face. And the atmosphere and constant chill while reading? It’s unparalleled and truly an experience like no other. “Maybe it’s that I find the idea comforting . . . that thousands of years after you’re gone . . . is when you really live. That your echo is louder than your voice.” I love this book for many reasons, but I also love it because it’s over the top, and has so many one-liners, and it’s painfully romantic, and the girl gets the girl at the end. And it’s what’s I’ve been waiting my whole reading life for. This is a better, and way more unique, and 100% more impressive version of what straight, white dudes have been publishing in SFF forever. I keep seeing people say that they feel this book is too confusing, the characters too over the top, and the world too complex, but I just don’t feel that way at all. This is the story my sapphic loving heart has been searching for in epic fantasy my whole life. Gideon the Ninth is my queer, literary loving heart’s anthem, and I plan to play it on repeat forever.This book has the best enemies to lovers romance I’ve ever read in all of my years. Yeah, you read that right. In my whole freaking life, this is my favorite. I’m talking OTP for the rest of my days. I didn’t exist before this ship sailed in this first book. And this book also has such a central theme of trust, and what it means to put your trust in another. Also, what it means to be trustful, and the privilege of having someone put their trust in you, unconditionally. And this book also has an amazing discussion on power dynamics and imbalances, and how important it is to be aware of these things while putting your trust in yourself and in someone else, simultaneously. “You are my only friend. I am undone without you.” Overall, this really just felt like the book I’ve been waiting my own personal eternity for. This felt like the book of my dreams and my hopes. All I want is ownvoices queer books, with f/f relationships, with cutthroat girls putting themselves first, but allowing themselves to be vulnerable enough to maybe let someone else get to see a softer side of them. Almost like I’ve been reviewing books for five years now, preparing myself to read and review Gideon the Ninth, even though I know no word combination or sentence structure I could ever come up with could do it justice for this story. Basically, I know this book isn’t going to be for everyone, but if you feel like you have similar reading taste to me, then I implore you to give this one a try. I mean, if the tagline “Lesbian Necromancers in Space” isn’t going to sell you, hopefully my emotional, bleeding heart self can. This book means everything to me, and I hope you enjoy if you pick it up.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Youtube | TwitchThe quotes above were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.Content and Trigger Warnings: graphic violence, gore, murder, mass murder, human sacrifice, many conversations about suicide, death, death of children, talk of depression, grief depiction, trauma depiction, loss of a loved one, lots of blood depiction, self-harm to get blood, and mentions of cancer.Also, I was so blessed, and I was able to meet Tamsyn at BookExpo and she is honestly the sweetest necromancer in the world, and she truly made my entire convention! 🖤⚔️
2333072082	“One flesh, one end, bitch.” I genuinely think about this book all the time, and I just need to say that this is the most upset I’ve been by an ending to a book in several years. When I completed it I started yelling audibly and my roommate, who was also awake, I believe may have become genuinely concerned for my sanity. Gideon the Ninth looked at me and said I could make her worse, and then it did, and it’s incurable. The gay people at my college own four collective copies of this and we pass it around to first years like a mini cult indoctrination and you now the worst part? It works. I cannot talk about the things about this book that make me genuinely crazy without getting into spoilers, so here is my short pitch: Lesbian necromancers in space, except the space part isn’t that relevant. In reality, it’s a And-Then-There-Were-None-esque murder mystery in which the two main characters are a buff lesbian with a sword and the most fucked up woman you have ever seen in your life. You will not solve the murder mystery. Gideon, the main character, makes the worst puns I have ever heard and it’s fantastic. I cannot even begin to explain how compelled I am by Harrow. No one in this book can be normal for more than ten seconds at a time. At least one meme will be quoted per book. I have never read anything more homoerotic in my life than the pool scene. I laughed. I also cried a lot. You should read it. Here are a few more detailed thoughts that I can give: Tamsyn Muir is genuinely fantastic at crafting a building narrative. You do not know how invested you are in Gideon the Ninth until the hits start coming, and by then Muir is ready to hit you with a punch. The first half is solid and interesting, but the last hundred pages are fully the best hundred pages of any book I have read in my life. (And it helps that her action writing is fantastic.)The main characters and side characters alike are so interesting. Harrow has the single most compelling backstory of any character I have had the delight of reading about. She has so many problems and I love her. Some highlights of the wider cast include Judith of the Second House; Ianthe and Coronabeth, incredibly abnormal twin heirs to the Third House; Palamedes and Camilla of the Sixth House, the latter of whom is honestly the most normal person in this book; and Dulcinea and Protesilaus, also normal people of the Seventh House. I am also obsessed with Gideon because she has just… the funniest narrative voice. Some examples? “I need to be inside you,” Harrowhark bellowed over the din.“Okay, you’re not even trying,” said Gideon.“Did you know that if you put the first three letters of your last name with the first three letters of your first name, you get ‘Sex Pal’?” Speaking of which I am. Embarrassingly invested. In the dynamic between Gideon and Harrowhark. I think about them all the time, by which I mean I’ve spent several days of my life consumed by thinking about them. I cannot say anything else at this time for legal reasons but just now that as if we are ever speaking I am pretending to be invested in our conversation but I am actually thinking about Gideon and Harrow. ___SPOILER SECTIONgay people: (view spoiler)[“I’ve lived my whole wretched life at your mercy, yours alone, and God knows I deserve to die at your hand. You are my only friend. I am undone without you.”Okay. Listen. I think there might be something wrong with me but this dynamic genuinely kills me. The desire in my heart for them to tenderly kiss on the lips is like a physical urge it’s tearing me apart. This might have been my joker origin story. (hide spoiler)]about harrow: (view spoiler)[I think “born a war crime” is a genuinely fascinating allegory for childhood trauma. Harrow has essentially been carrying the guilt for seventeen years of knowing her existence means the death of 200 innocents, and she blames herself totally and utterly, but she does not have a choice in that. (hide spoiler)]the twists: (view spoiler)[The true nature of lyctors genuinely haunts me I think about that reveal all the time. And also Dulcinea being Cytherea is truly a banger. I love Ianthe being duplicitous, I love how many moving parts there are to this book, I love that you don’t really suspect the right people and when you do it’s never for the right things. (hide spoiler)]spoilers for harrow the ninth: (view spoiler)[“I have spent your life trying to make you regret that you weren’t dead, all because—I regretted I wasn’t! I ate you alive, and you have the temerity to tell me that you’re sorry?”HNNNG I just noticed the foreshadowing of this. Harrow I don’t know how to tell you this but in the next book she is going to fully on page say that all she ever wanted you to do was eat her. which is by the way one of the absolute craziest lines I’ve ever read in my life I cannot stop thinking about it. (hide spoiler)]In conclusion. I think about this book all the time. I have been getting all of my friends to obsess over it and I think you should hop on this train, personally.

2994599035	“Maybe it’s that I find the idea comforting . . . that thousands of years after you’re gone . . . is when you really live. That your echo is louder than your voice.” Ugh, I wish I hadn't taken so long to sit down and write a review of this. I prefer writing a review when everything is fresh in my mind, but I do actually have things I want to say about this dark, dense, totally unique fantasy.One thing I think it might be helpful to know when starting this book is: you're going to just have to make peace with not totally "getting" it for a while. If you're anything like me, when you read something you don't really understand, you read it again and again until it makes sense. In my experience this can lead to book slumps, and I just don't think it's that helpful when it comes to Gideon the Ninth. Things get painted in over the course of the whole novel, so just accepting I didn't understand it at first made it much more palatable.Because this world is dense and complex and, with a little patience, absolutely fascinating. Nobody can accuse Muir of a lack of imagination. This surely has to be one of the most detailed and unique necromancer fantasies ever written (though connoisseurs of that niche might be able to tell me different). In this world, the Emperor has a representative of each of the nine houses (with their accompanying cavalier) compete in a series of weird and dangerous trials in order to determine those most worthy of being a servant of the Resurrection, complete with power and immortality.The plot is simple; the world-building and writing are anything but. However, more than either of those, what made this book shine so so much for me was Gideon. Well, really, a number of the characters, but mostly Gideon. How to explain her... She's a snarky lovable badass but with none of the standard heroine, fits-a-perfect-mold kind of badassery that I've grown so tired of. She's just really cool and funny. And somehow relatable, even though I can honestly say I've never been a swordswoman in space (no, really).Honestly, as a character she really stands out as someone unique. Which is saying a lot because I've read a ton of fantasy books and most of them are obviously recycling characters at this point. Here, working through the author's challenging prose and world-building was easier because I cared so much about Gideon. This book really proves how much characters make or break a book. Without Gideon, I am sure this would have gone to my mental "not for me" pile.Muir's ending hit me in the feels, too. The book surprised me by having a bunch of sad and sweet moments amid the darkness. I'm almost afraid to read Harrow the Ninth, but hell am I going to.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
4214573454	I am late in reviewing this, as I finished it over a year ago, but it's a sign of the book's strength that I am still thinking about it! Muir has created a galactic empire upheld by necromancy: Nine houses, each of which governs it own world and specializes in its own form of death magic, all bound together by the Emperor, the immortal Necrolord Prime and his band of super-powerful, undying "necrosaints" -- the Lyctors. The emperor has held power for ten thousand years, but despite his godlike abilities, all is not well in his galactic death cult. Wars are being waged against faraway enemies. Battles are being lost. Attrition is high. Then a strange call goes out from the First House, the emperor's own: We need more Lyctors. Each house is invited to send their heir apparent and cavalier (elite bodyguard) to the First House for a set of mysterious trials. Those who survive and prove themselves worthy will ascend to Lyctorhood, gaining immortality and powers almost equal to the emperor himself. A hard invitation to refuse, right?Meanwhile, in the gloomy Ninth House, Gideon Nav wants to run away from her horrible life. She has no one in the dreary world of the Ninth, where undead skeletons are much more common than living folk and the average age of the nuns and priests who guard the Locked Tomb is about 85. The only other person Gideon's age is the heir apparent, the Reverend Daughter Harrowhark, who treats Gideon like a personal whipping post. When the Emperor's call goes out, however, the two are forced to work together. Harrow is the heir and the best necromancer on the planet, adept at crafting with the bones of the dead. Gideon is the best sword-fighter, especially since the house's actual cavalier fled to planet. The two young women strike a bargain: If Gideon pretends to be Harrow's cavalier and goes to the First House trials, Harrow will grant her her freedom, assuming Harrow is able to become a Lyctor and save the honor of her dying home world. What follows is part Dune (dueling royal houses in space), part Nico di Angelo (snarky queer death demigods) and part Agatha Christie locked-room mystery (Locked Tomb mystery?). Gideon and Harrow have to learn to work together, or at least not kill each other, while all around them in the creepy halls and secret laboratories of the First House, people start disappearing . . . The secret to becoming a Lyctor might be worse than any of them ever imagined. Muir's writing is a sheer delight, sparkling with zinger dialogue and bone-dry humor. Gideon is just my kind of narrator: irreverent, irrepressible, and lovably grumpy. Her relationship with Harrow is wonderfully depicted: with frenemies like this, who needs . . . uh, frenemies? There are a lot of characters to keep up with once we reach the First House, and the story unfolds in multiple layers that can be a challenge to track, but wow, the pay-off! Once you hit those last hundred pages, I defy you to set this story down. Fortunately, this is the first book in a trilogy, and I can't wait to see what happens in the follow-up Harrow the Ninth!
2972653294	I cannot actually believe my hands declared their independence from the auto-control of my brain and gave 3.5 stars and rounded it down to three stars! I can shout at my hands and tell them they are ungrateful! They should have clapped this author’s creativity for this controversial, unique, fantastic plot and good characterization but well, my hands made the right decision! You know why! Okay keep reading and stop yawning in front of me! I already started my happy dance and dropped this book several times as I performed Travolta’s classic hip and point move because I started one of the most anticipated books of the year and it deserved to be celebrated with my over exaggerated dance moves (at least I gave an quiet amazing show to the neighbor’s kids who got bored from their Fifa tournaments on play station)How can you resist to a plot about necromancers and well rounded, intriguing badass heroine characters. But when I started to flip pages, my thoughts completely changed. I read 150 pages…Nothing happened…I treated this book as patient as I could (I’m aries, patience is not my best virtue) and I read 50 pages more. Nada… Another 50 pages more…Still nothing… I started to think maybe Jerry Seinfield used a different pen name and wrote this book about nothingness as he’d done with his TV show “Seinfield” Well 50 pages later…Still nothing happened and I cuddled with the book and took a break because I got also lost with the technical terms of the book. I even tried to order a dictionary about necromancers to understand their terminology. But no publishing companies released this useful source! I also had hard time to understand true natures, attributes, motives, back stories of characters because they were more 15! There are nine houses and I prepared schematic to match the characters with its houses like I’d done with the time tables of character’s aging when I was watching enigmatic German Netflix series named Dark! I was so bored and suffering from lack of energy. I couldn’t even lift my glass so my husband helped me drink my Chardonnay with a straw (I know, I disgusted with myself, too!) And after 300 pages later, something magically happened! THE STORY’S PACE SUDDENLY FASTENED! The story turned into a great combination of space opera, thriller, mystery and sci-fi. It was sad, funny some parts are too edgy, gothic and irritating. Actually I appreciated writer’s effort to create this amazing and extraordinary concept. However the creativity and visualization defeated by complex, long, slow-paced writing and unlikable characters. Especially heroine acted so immature and annoying little brat who deserved my tones of slaps. If it wasn’t for the first 300 torture, I could give this book 5 stars for the author’s success to bring out something different, shiny, capturing, special but in my opinion, book was needed reductions and polishing of characterizations before the release date! I still enjoyed so many parts but I felt like I watched three times the first 28 minutes of Saving Private Ryan! I got really exhausted as if I ran 10K marathon or 10 bottle Chardonnay drinkathon! Intentions, originality, high efforts of the author but maybe I lately read too long books and my timing was not right to start something needs to much energy, concentration. So unfortunately this one didn’t work for me,too.

3466794985	"While we were developing common sense, she studied the blade." Gideon the Ninth comes from an universe seeped in necromancy.Her home planet, the Ninth planet, is by far the most isolated but when the Emperor calls for representatives from all of the Houses to a series of trials to determine the worthiest to inherit unimaginable power.Harrow is the heir of the Ninth and the strongest necromancer of their planet and she needs....a sword. And Gideon just-so-happens to know the sword. "But Gideon was experiencing one powerful emotion: being sick of everyone’s shit." Gideon and Harrow have hated each other ever since they could remember. But when Harrow dangles Gideon's freedom...Gideon knows that no matter what she will have to follow this through...to the very end itself. “just had a near-death experience,” she said, “let me have my little moment.” Oh. My. Gosh.This book. Holy crap. I'm so dead. I'm ruined for any and all future books.And that's keeping in mind that I struggled to follow this book.There's an absolute ton of lore and terms thrown at you from the very first page.The plot starts going and absolutely refuses to back up and explain. And the characters? Whip smart and leagues ahead of me.And yet...all the confusion and absolute chaos worked so incredibly perfect.. Gideon was so freaking hilarious, Harrow was stunning and their world was horrifyingly cruel. I couldn't look away.The world was so wholly complete and truly stunning. The necromantic magic was so well-thought out and fascinating. I really do believe that I need to reread this one to pick up a few more things but I honestly can't wait.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
4573173065	Check out my YouTube channel where I show my instant reactions upon finishing reading fantasy books. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.Did not finish at 95% completion. I just couldn't punish myself any longer.I really should have seen this one coming, as the book has so many features that do not work for me as a reader. While there are exceptions to all of these genres, in general I'm not usually a big science fiction fan, nor a horror fan, nor a mystery fan. But the book is so highly rated in the fantasy book community and many reviewers who I usually agree with said positive things about this book that I decided to give it a try. But I should have listened to my gut because not only did all of these things add up to a very bad tasting cocktail of a book, but I found the writing style and characters to be...and I say this trying to be as kind as I possibly can...absolutely abysmal.The plot of this book revolved around a "whodunit", and while on it's own this isn't horrible, the central plot has so little tension that it ended up being a severe bore for me. People are randomly dying and everyone is blaming each other, and the feeling the author is trying to convey is one of tension, but for me I just didn't end up caring and hoping it would get revealed earlier so the book could hurry up and finish.The worldbuilding is extremely shallow, which was especially frustrating because the foundation that is lain out at the beginning of the book had a lot of promise. I wanted to know about the world the characters were living on, why there are different schools of necromany, the details of the ongoing war and the reason for the collapsing empire. I got none of that, and was rather quickly thrown into a game of "Clue" instead.Aside from Gideon and her necromancer Harrowhark from the 9th house, there are seven other "houses" of people competing to solve the mystery. But those characters don't get much depth, and are mostly referred to by their house titles (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.). This ends up needlessly confusing, and makes the characters entirely forgettable.Gideon herself is most certainly in my top 3 least favorite POV characters in fantasy that I've ever read. While she has a compelling backstory that gets revelations later in the book, her personality can best be described as extremely edgy teenager. Everything she says is either sarcastic, full of contempt, trying to be too cool (get ready for plenty of uses of "dope", and other similar uses of complex vocabulary), or some combination of the above.I could go on, and on - but I'm going to stop here so I can just stop thinking about this book and move on to something else. This book may be right up your alley, especially if you are into science fiction and mysteries - but it's definitely not for me.
4922771263	taking years to read popular books only to ultimately dislike them so i can feel unique.https://emmareadstoomuch.substack.com...to be fair, that wasn't the intention. i have put this book on and taken this book off my tbr many times, hearing again and again that this "wasn't like other fantasy books" and "is sharp and dark and funny" and contains a violence and cruelty that for me can only be a green flag.so in august 2022, i put it there to stay.even though i did still have a gut feeling, in spite of all those trusted opinions, that i wouldn't like it.and then 3 years passed.i picked it up for a post specifically targeting the oldest books on my tbr.and i really, really didn't like it.from page one this reveals itself to have an overpowering style and tumblr humor i can only describe as aggressively published in 2019. i am not an audiobook reader but before the 25% mark i tried to see if my library had an available copy so i could switch. i call this "the gentleman's DNF."it is just…not my writing style (words used for sounds instead of meaning) or my sense of humor (quirky 2010s i did a thing) or my genre preference (i don’t read fantasy often and when i do i prefer it to have a plot). overall it gives the vibe of overwritten in the hopes of disguising all the ways it’s underwritten.by the time i was barely halfway through (somehow) i was crying for mercy on the dialogue alone. was this worth the wait? well, if you don’t have anything nice to say you're not supposed to say anything at all. but i already said a bunch of mean stuff and it’s not like i’m going to delete it, so…bottom line: no. it’s not.
2987716891	ARC & Review copy provided by the publisher—Tor.com—in exchange for an honest review. Gideon the Ninth is a damn fine example of why readers’ reviews are incredibly important. If you have been active on bookish social media, you should know by now that Gideon the Ninth, Tamsyn Muir’s debut and the first installment in The Locked Tomb (or The Ninth House in the past) Trilogy, has been tor.com's most hyped book of the year. The buzz and praise for Gideon the Ninth has been immense to say the least. Knowing nothing other than the fact that “Lesbian necromancers in space” was stamped on the front of the gorgeous cover art (illustrated by Tommy Arnold), I gave the ARC a try a few months ago only to find myself disappointed by how much it didn’t work for me back then. If I may be brutally honest, I DNFed the novel around 120 pages in on my first read-through. Since then, readers’ reviews have started pouring in, usually resulting in absolute love or disappointment; there’s almost no in-between. But there’s one common consensus shared by both factions: the second half improved significantly. After receiving another copy of this book, a limited edition with black sprayed edges and many goodies, it was only fair that I give it one more try. The result? I enjoyed it remarkably more than I did on my first try. I truly believe that knowing the right things to expect out of this book ahead of reading it will improve the reader’s enjoyment so much more. Picture: The book and the goodies I received! Gideon Nav—or Gideon the Ninth—prepares to escape again but she can’t do it without doing one last service for her childhood nemesis: Harrowhark Nonagesimus. The Emperor of the First House has sent an invitation to all the heirs of each one of his Houses to attend a trial of wit and skill; the winner will become a Lyctor—an immortal and a direct all-powerful servant of the Emperor. Each heir needs a cavalier, a bodyguard, to help them win the trial and this is where Gideon comes in, serving as Harrow’s cavalier. Gideon the Ninth isn’t an easy book for me to review because of the opposite reaction I had in the reading experience of the first half and the second half. Several readers—myself included—have mentioned that the first half of the book was difficult to get through and I really can’t blame them. In my opinion, the first half was a struggle to read because of how annoying and tiring Gideon’s voice can be to read, which became even more intolerable when the vow of silence was put on Gideon by Harrow and Harrow herself wasn’t in the scenes to act as a counterbalance against Gideon’s attitudes for almost 100 pages. Gideon acted and talked like a juvenile trying way too hard to be funny and edgy and it became annoying quickly. The side characters—excluding Harrow—also took a while to remember and warm up to. Please remember that there’s a character glossary at the beginning of the book to help you remember who’s who more easily; put it to good use. But here’s the important thing, these minor complaints from me, somehow, existed only within the first half; the second half turned the book completely around and headed into a significantly better direction for me. I honestly didn’t think a turnaround was possible. However, once the story entered Act 3, and the genre shifted more to a murder mystery, I found every single aspect of the book so much better to read. Gideon the Ninth is a bizarre book that doesn’t fall into one specific genre properly; it’s like a hybrid between sci-fi, fantasy, and mystery. I highly enjoyed reading the second half of Gideon the Ninth, because the murder mysteries elements were captivating, Muir’s prose became much easier to follow, the action sequences were awesome, and most importantly the character development—especially for Gideon and Harrow—was terrific. A huge part of why the sudden positive change in reading enjoyment was possible is due to Harrow’s role in the story. I loved Harrow and personally think she’s a much better character than Gideon. What made this even more incredible is that Harrow doesn’t even have a POV to follow; the narrative was told entirely from Gideon’s perspective and yet, Harrow stole the spotlight for me. “Anyone can learn to fight. Hardly anyone learns to think.” Also, I have to give tons of praise to Muir’s imaginative action scenes. The deathly army of bones and visceral swordplay unleashed throughout the novel were darkly delightful to read, but the final 40 pages exceeded everything that came before; it was simply glorious. I’m not kidding, a maelstrom of bones, gripping revelations, and cinematic scenes full of twists and turns, flashy swordplay, and extraordinary necromancy created a memorable final sequence that made me incredibly excited to continue to the next book as soon as possible. I want to read more of this necromantic whirlwind. Picture: Construct by Tommy Arnold As you can probably guess, I have a contrasting opinion regarding the first and second halves of the novel. However, and this is very important, it’s worth noting that the superbly thrilling second half won admiration and my utmost interest to continue to the sequel, Harrow the Ninth, which obviously will feature Harrow (yay!!!) as the main focus of the story. Imbued with intriguing mysteries, terrifically written swordplay, explosive final sequences, and a lasting impression, needless to say Gideon the Ninth has become one of the most original SFF debuts I’ve read so far. It’s bizarre, complex, imaginative, genres-defying, and distinctively memorable; I am very much looking forward to reading the continuation of Muir’s imagination in Harrow the Ninth.You can order the book from: Amazon UK | Amazon US | Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions
2836376308	oooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for BEST SCIENCE FICTION and BEST DEBUT NOVEL 2019! what will happen?”You want to fight it.”“Yep.”“Because it looked…a little like swords.””Yop.” okay. so. usually when i write a review, i am writing it for some nameless, faceless reader who is deciding whether or not to read a book and looking for some information to help them make that decision, so i’ll do the whole plot-point, pull-quote thing—giving an overview of the book so they know what to expect, to know if it’s their kind of thing or not. those are the reviews i find the most helpful to me, so that’s what i put out there. this time…just, no. there’s no way i can explain the premise of this book. i envy and respect anyone who attempts it, but i can’t be that girl this time. this book is…a lot. it’s got a ton of characters, a complexly-constructed world, and a genre mash made up of space opera, murder mystery, horror, and whatever the literary term is for where it’s like a magic-and-science-based scavenger hunt at the olympics, but where some people are expected to die. i’m not gonna lie, i got lost a couple of times. helpful dramatis personae pages are helpful but i would also suggest you bookmark the page where the characters gather for the first time, to memory-refresh the personality details of the eighteen competitors, because some of them got blurry for me. there are a lot of working parts here, and the worldbuilding is thick, but like the House of the First itself, it’s a little bit ramshackle, with unexplained bits and leftover pieces. but just go with it, plow right into the whole bone-cladded thicket of it, because it’s a romp of a book, and it’s propulsive enough to carry you through the story without understanding every little thing. in fact, the lingering mysteries will only add to your appreciation. it’s a ridiculously fun book, sad and funny and irreverent and suspenseful, with all the dramatically satisfying themes of honor and heroism, loyalty and betrayal, piloted by gideon, a snarky firecracker of a heroine who declares “that’s what she said,” not once, but TWICE, which is—to me—the height of comedy and a phrase certain to win my love. try it, you'll like it! i'm already hungering for books 2 and 3!oh, and someone give danny elfman a copy of this book. and, since you’re already there, tell him i need an oingo boingo reunion tour.********************************thank you, i DID!********************************okay, let's do this.**********************************my stack of "books i am drooling over and need to read immediately" is the cursiest blessing...come to my blog!
3685104293	Wow-I loved this! Gideon the Ninth is a unique take on speculative fiction with a fascinating world, vivid characters, compelling relationship dynamics, and a bit of a closed-room mystery, all injected with a lot of humour. I love the casual queerness of several characters, and I found Gideon, our protagonist, hugely entertaining. While it took me a little while to warm up to her, I really adored her once I did. I loved seeing a little more of the vulnerability underneath her standoffish, sarcastic exterior, and I enjoyed seeing her develop a variety of different types of relationships with the characters she meets, finding connection, friendship, and belonging in a way she had never felt before. This was also paced very well, in my opinion. I was invested from the first chapter and intrigued the whole way through, and while the plot moved along at a steady pace, it never felt rushed. I will say that this book does have one of my series' pet peeves: Muir ends this first instalment a bit abruptly, abandoning too many threads to be picked up in subsequent books, leaving me feeling like there wasn't a true conclusion to the first part of the story or any of the character arcs of the first book. In this case, Gideon is our protagonist, and while we have a fantastic beginning and middle for her character arc, we don't really get an end to her journey of internal growth. I would have, at the very least, appreciated a strong hint at her origins, and though I'm sure this will be addressed in future books in the series, I can't help but feel that reveal belonged here as the button to her story, even if there was more to learn or more to be revealed later on.I also realize that not all characters with dynamic chemistry have to end up together romantically. Still, I must admit I was a bit disappointed that we didn't see (view spoiler)[Harrow and Gideon (hide spoiler)] start a romantic relationship. I do quite enjoy their dynamic throughout the whole book as it evolves and changes; and I especially appreciated how their relationship solidified by the end of the book. I thought it was wholesome, heartwarming, and lovely. But, I am such a romantic at heart that I really wanted them to fall in love romantically. Then again, friendship is fantastic; we love friendship, and this book is, in many ways, an exploration of the many faces of platonic intimacy, so this is not really a drawback. I simply must admit that I was hoping for that throughout the entire book and was kind of sad that it didn't happen!I was able to foresee many of the twists and reveals here, but there was still enough that surprised me throughout the story that I didn't feel that it was too predictable. There was a nice balance between giving us enough hints to figure out the mysteries ahead of time while still keeping the upper hand as the author to surprise us, and I feel, in general, that Muir did a fantastic job managing all of the mysterious twists and turns!Anyway, I loved this book, and while the ending did bug me *just* a little bit, I can't help but give it five stars. It is fantastic overall, and I enjoyed the experience of reading it so much that I immediately wanted to jump into the sequel - so I can't be too mad about the loose threads at the end of this installment. I trust Muir to tie them all up through the rest of the series, and in general, I'm excited about this world and his characters and love how unique this story is!Representation: multiple sapphic characters, including a lesbian MCTrigger/Content Warnings: violence, blood, death, loss of parents, body horror, suicide, infant and child murderThis was one of my favourite books of 2024!

2915200131	I've been sitting on this DNF for a couple months now. For those of you who are avid YouTube watchers of mine, you know I could not get through this book. I wasn't going to rate it but I feel SO strongly about this 1 star rating. This book suffers from the Tor hype as did The Ruin of Kings by Jenn Lyons which I also highly disliked. The writing is a mess. Characters names are "neiowhgiewongow"..The main character is an absolute ass. She gets the chance to get off the planet and her literal response is “go suck a dick”This book tried so hard to be edgy and goth, with skellies and DEAD DEAD DEAD and absolutely failed.
2917255118	Well, I finished. If nothing else, at least I received closure that it wasn't the timing that was off for me surrounding this story. I could go through a long list of why this book didn't work for me, but instead I'll just leave it at that, it didn't work for me. Chaima wrote a fantastic review that expresses my thoughts 100% HERE, so if you'd like an alternative, unpopular opinion that is well written and fairly offered, please check it out. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.
2883586038	Star Rating: —> 5 [GLORIOUS] Stars!🌟⭐️🌟⭐️🌟My heart hurts. It ACHES. SO INCREDIBLE. I literally cried when it was over & as it was ending. I mean that ending? And this whole damn novel? Brutal AF!Perfection. Truly. Im so confused as to some readers’ complaints that this was extremely confusing & didn’t follow a solid plot line (incl. subplots) that made sense... hmm. (You can skip over this part if you aren’t interested!)***BUT! before I go into any more detail... I have stumbled upon the PERFECT way to experience this novel. Through suffering the flu & needing something to sub for physically reading when i felt too sick to, I found that the audiobook (which is one of the best I’ve ever listened to, btw, EVER) is an absolute necessity as a companion to READING the book! I know it isn’t the most cost effective way to read, BUT, it is SO. WORTH. IT WITH THIS BOOK; GUYS... It was SO WELL DONE & captures everything perfectly. Plus, I don’t think I would’ve truly gotten to know Gideon, or Harrow, for that matter & be able to honestly say that I TRULY understand either of them as their unique selves, without listening to it! Plus if you’re someone who was or is having any sort of trouble with the book, I say give it a second chance with “my” method! 😉***ANYWAY; I felt that the novel was SOLID. The main storyline is pretty straight forward; Necromancer & Heir to the Ninth House, Reverend Daughter Harrowhark Nonagesimus, & her Cavalier Gideon Nav, answer the call of the Emperor to compete against the other Houses heirs for a chance to win the place of Lyctor, an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection. The events that occur within & around this are yes, complex & messy, but they’re messy in the best way possible... with a fascinating arcane-like, necromantic science that is so original & interesting. There are secrets & mysteries abound in the palace (GOTHIC PALACE IN FRIGGIN SPACE!). The story was beautifully executed & extremely, extremely creative, but purposefully messy, sort of like a Picasso painting, but with more secrets held within, like a Van Gogh.It screams out, as if to remind us that writers are artists, too, without trying too hard. The imaginative, eccentric, anything goes, artistic aesthetic of this science fantasy novel has IMO, proven without a doubt that it is a TRUE piece of art! It presents itself effortlessly.The character development was incredible. I was so incredibly impressed! There are SO MANY characters, and all are so FULLY & RICHLY developed, which makes this that much more of a feat! But this DOES mean if you aren’t paying full attention you might (probably will) get lost!I loved Gideon Nav from freakin start to freakin finish (I sometimes had to listen to the audiobook when i was busy... and it. WAS. FRICKIN. FANTASTIC ! I recommend 100%... you truly get a taste of who Gideon is... they do SUCH a good job. I adored it), and she has, and this does not at all do her justice, a CRAZY. ASS. personality. She exists on just... another plane!I ended up LOVING Harrowhark as well. She isn’t who she seems at first per se, and i think this really did well by her, prepping us for her being the lead in the second book of the quartet ! I can’t wait; I really just LOVE HER SO MUCH! They are the PERFECT PAIR! Above all else this was just FUN AF. It never takes itself too seriously, and is so over the top that its just a joy to read. Absolutely hilarious, as well... it had me laughing my ass off for most of the novel. [The audiobook intensifies the hilarity ENDLESSLY ! ...and i actually just had an epiphany! This needs to be talked about as an opening, because it could really solve some readers’ issues w/ the novel... ]...So; by now you’ve already read what i have to say regarding the audiobook, above. Haha. AND you got you witness just when i had my epiphany haha. Omg what history you’ve gotten to experience 😂😂😂.Just a reminder... you’re missing out without listening to at least some of it! BUT although I do WAY prefer reading to listening to audiobooks, this book imo was meant to be an *experience* & the switching between reading & listening really added that extra something. the narrator did SUCH AN EXCELLENT JOB! If you’re one of those who’s not yet read it but knows they will start out super critical of the book due to negative reviews... use the audiobook a lot throughout the beginning of the book, as the characters are being introduced, and then switch back and forth as you please. But I truly think ANYONE would have their best Gideon The Ninth experience with a little audiobook added in! Sorry if this was repetitive, i don’t know yet because, well, I quite literally haven’t written the edit up top yet 😉! *time warp!* ;-)Anyway... I recommend 100%. This book made me FEEL. It had me completely enthralled; I loved it so, so, much.Also, to those of you who’ve read:Anyone else notice MAJOR hinting at & foreshadowing regarding Gideon that I am absolutely (sort of) sure will develop into something that will make (most of) us extremely happy! I don’t understand it completely yet, because anything goes in this crazy universe... BUT in addition to hints fresh in my mind, when reflecting on my reading experience, i ended up recalling quite a few clues & puzzle pieces that were scattered throughout the novel, as well. They make me hope that something... bigger will happen. I certainly know SOMETHING will occur, the comments made are certainly not nonsense, they’re there for us to speculate !(Trying not to say too much, lol, sorry if that wasn’t... particularly... coherent 😉).100% recommend— but perhaps not to readers who value simplicity & straightforwardness... because this is just... NOT that. Lol.
3215297868	Tor free ebook of the month, if you join their book club. https://www.tor.com/2021/10/05/downlo... Sale ends midnight E.T., Friday Oct. 8, 2021. This one won't be every reader's cuppa tea - read the reviews and decide for yourself - but those who like it tend to REALLY like it.4.5 stars, rounding up. This is one of those books that gets better the more I think about it! Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature: Necromancers and their sword-fighting cavaliers star in Gideon the Ninth, Tamsyn Muir’s radically original debut novel, which has been nominated for the 2019 Nebula Award. This science fantasy novel, steeped in an atmosphere of decay and decrepitude, is a mix of space opera and a gruesome treasure hunt that takes place in a spooky, crumbling castle. At the same time, it’s set in an interstellar empire consisting of nine planets, each one ruled by a different House of necromancers.Eighteen-year-old Gideon Nav is trying to escape her forced servitude in the particularly moribund Ninth House, where she’s surrounded by living skeletons and corpses and near-dead nobles and nuns who pray on knucklebones. Gideon’s escape plan involves sneaking off the entire Ninth planet in a space shuttle that she secretly ordered to come pick her up. Her flight is foiled at the last moment by Harrowhark, a young woman who is the powerful heir of the Ninth House, able to animate skeletons and corpses with a gesture … and Gideon’s lifelong enemy and nemesis. But Harrow offers Gideon a possible alternative way out of her miserable life.The Emperor has summoned the heirs of the other eight Houses and their prime cavaliers (noble courtiers trained in rapier fighting) to come to the planet of the First House to compete to become the Emperor’s new Lyctors, semi-immortal elite necromancer knights. If Gideon will act as Harrow’s prime cavalier — the actual cavalier of the Ninth House being unable and unwilling to take on the obligation — Harrow promises that she will give Gideon her freedom afterwards. Gideon is an indentured servant, not a courtier, and she’s trained in fighting with a two-handed infantry sword, not a rapier, so it will be a massive challenge. Still, the emperor’s contest presents a life-changing opportunity for both Gideon and Harrow … if they survive.Gideon the Ninth starts off a little slow but picks up steam steadily, becoming increasingly multi-layered and compelling as it propels the reader toward an intense, heart-pounding ending. The turning point for me was about a third of the way in, when it began to be clear how brilliantly Muir has woven science and future technology into a plot that initially seemed overwhelmingly fantasy. The worldbuilding is stellar, a gore-soaked, moldering edifice that’s eminently suited to the necromancy that is its center.At the same time, it also became apparent that both the characters and the torturous challenges they were facing were far more complex than they at first appeared. The various ordeals that the necromancers and their cavaliers have to go through to earn certain keys actually have substantive significance. Gideon and Harrow have a complicated relationship built on mutual hatred and snarky insults, but there are guilty feelings and more hiding beneath the skull paint they put on their faces every day. The secondary characters were so numerous – fifteen other heir/necromancers and cavaliers for the other seven competing Houses — that I was having difficulty keeping them all straight, though they each specialize in a different aspect of necromancy and there are several vividly drawn characters among them. (Protip: there’s an enormously helpful list of the Nine Houses and the characters that belong to each of the Houses at the beginning of the book, that I somehow managed to overlook until I was finished with the book.) This is the type of book where a second reading would be really enjoyable and illuminating, where you catch a lot of significant details and nuances that you overlooked on first read.Gideon the Ninth combines unique worldbuilding, some fascinating twists and turns in the plot, intriguing and unique main characters, and an engaging writing style. I’m excited to dive into the sequel, Harrow the Ninth, which will be published in June 2020.Initial post: This one just landed on my doorstep! Actually I asked the publicist for it since (a) it's a Nebula nominee, and (b) they'd already sent me the sequel, Harrow the Ninth (unasked for), and I've got this general rule about not reading sequels if I haven't read the first book. So here we go!Content notes: quite a few F-bombs, lots of gore. The main character is lesbian, but there are no explicit sex scenes.

2740858568	“Gideon, don’t be sorry for the dead. I think death must be an absolute triumph.”The first thing you need to know about this book is that a lot of people are going to hate it.I’ve already seen several reviewers complain about how weird, confusing, and slow it is. I’ve heard people rant about the protagonist’s smartassery and complete inability to refrain from cracking jokes at the most inconvenient times. Believe me, I get it.This book is unlike anything you’ve ever read. It’s more or less a gritty fantasy story made out of memes, except the memes in question are set in a crumbling palace in space complete with an aggressively goth aesthetic, some creepy mysteries, and a slow burn enemies-to-lovers lesbian romance. Does that sound appealing to you? If the answer is yes, you’ll probably enjoy Gideon the Ninth as much as I did.In case you’re still not convinced (again, I get it) be aware that the first eight chapters are available for free on Tor.com: it’s probably a good idea to read them before buying the book. You’ll get a good grasp of the author’s writing style and sense of humor, which I personally loved, but other readers may find aggravating.As for the story itself...let’s just say it’s not your typical good-versus-evil epic fantasy adventure. There’s certainly some good, some more evil, and a shit ton of creepy-borderline-horror stuff. Apparently Muir started her career as a horror writer and likes to mingle different genres in her works, so don’t expect Gideon the Ninth to strictly adhere to sci-fi conventions: sure, it’s set in space, but characters use magic and fight with swords. And if you’re wondering why the people in this book know how to fly spaceships but not how to use guns, well...that’s kind of the Big Mystery of the series. Or at least, I think it is: the author confirmed that the world building will be revealed as the story progresses and that the origin of the Houses is a crucial plot point, so I can only assume every seemingly incoherent detail has a logical explanation behind it. In any case, I had the impression that the narrative was giving me exactly the amount of information I needed to understand what was going on at any given point — no more, no less.I should also mention that this is a very slow story filled with mysteries and obscure details, so the pacing can sometimes lag. There’s actually quite a lot of action too, just it’s diluted throughout the novel (much to Gideon’s chagrin) and interspersed with magical/scientific challenges and murder mysteries. Speaking of which, I loved the magic system in this world. All magicians are necromancers, but there are so many different types of necromancy that you never know what they’re going to pull out of their hat. Muir decided to approach magic from a scientific perspective and basically turn necromancers into death scientists, which...if that doesn’t sound awesome to you, don’t get anywhere close to this book (and also, what are you doing on my profile?). Another element I really enjoyed were the characters. Gideon is a ridiculously endearing protagonist with a big heart and an irresistible sense of humor, and Harrow...well, Harrow has more or less become my new role model. I mean, just look at how she’s introduced into the story:“The Lady of the Ninth House stood before the drillshaft, wearing black and sneering. Reverend Daughter Harrowhark Nonagesimus had pretty much cornered the market on wearing black and sneering. It comprised 100 percent of her personality.”How could you possibly not love her?To be honest, I think the single biggest strength of this book — besides its originality — is the fact that it doesn’t take itself too seriously: the tone is intentionally irreverent and tongue-in-cheek, balancing what would otherwise be a very dark and grim story. Ultimately, I think your enjoyment of Gideon the Ninth will vary based on whether or not you like the writing style and whimsical setting.As for me, I can’t wait to get my hands on the next installment of this fresh, innovative, and deeply emotional series...especially after that ending nearly broke my heart!
2681637886	4.5 stars TW: everything that comes with death magic; blood; bones; gore; body horror; cancer; suicide I might bump this up to 5 but my brain is a little overwhelmed to think with everything that happened at the very end of this book. This is what is says on the tin (“lesbian necromancer and her lesbian guard and other necromancer nobles explore a haunted gothic palace in space”) and much more. This book is incredibly hard to explain and that’s why it’s so polarizing. It’s eerie at times. Funny (depending on your sense of humor). Bizarre. Complicated. Tragic. There’s even a clue like who-done-it mystery because people start dying while trapped in this potentially haunted gothic mansion! It’s a lot. Also, true enemies to... something? There’s continuous banter and not what I’d call a romance but there is something there for those wanting some wlw goodness. The last 50 or so pages of this are intense with a LOT of body horror so be warned. I have no idea what direction the rest of the series will go in! I’ll be posting a review and discussion on my channel.
2571465439	Stunningly good. A brilliant and original mash-up of genres, the story is brimming with memorable characters, acerbic dark humor, a unique magic system, space travel, decaying technology and layers upon layers of mystery. It is the Gothic space adventure I didn't know I needed.
4834398376	4.5 starsMan, this was good!I loved Gideon and Harrowhark's snarky hateful love for each other. Fast pace, great dialogue, lots of humor, and an incredible setting. It feels like some kind of crazy mash-up of fantasy and science fiction. Necromancers in space with nothing but their (semi) faithful sword-wielding guards to protect them or something.That ending! What?! I want more. I've got such a good feeling about whatever that more consists of that I'm really excited to get my hands on the next book.The audiobook with Moira Quirk as the narrator was wonderful! If you're into audiobooks, go for it.Good stuff, especially if you're looking for something a little outside the box.Recommended.
4236727565	okay i am in love with Gideon like i have a crush on her. i was a bit confused reading the book which usually is fine but i just feel like a bit more could’ve been explained. Hopefully in Harrow’s book that is fixed because i really intrigued with the book.
3171722044	Buddy read with BBNNever have I ever seen such a misleading publicity, I know its petty cause the book delivered half but its still a lie, We picked this book to read in one of my book clubs because its about Lesbian Necromancer but the book only delivered on the necromancer part. Gideon who is the supposed queer character isn't even a necromancer so how, she just had a crush on a necromancer which in my opinion wasn't returned, she also thought Niberius a guy was hot but that doesn't make her straight so its all confusing.I also disliked the writing style used in this book, the info dump was just too much. There was a part where the author was describing the environment for 10 pages straight, who does that. If the author isn't describing the environment for the millionth time we're stuck in Gideon's internal monologue. I don't even like Gideon the protagonist, I disliked all the characters except Sextus. I was in Gideon's head throughout the book and I still didn't understand her, she went was hating Harrow's gut to whatever that ending is. It makes absolutely no sense, I was in her head so I should know if she was pretending or changed her opinion, but alas I don't know what happened there.This book is more like a horror, some bunch of teenagers and like three adults or so went to a planet for a test to become a Lyctor which is a name for the emperor's advisers/elite necromancers. The house they were in was hunted by creatures they know nothing about. Just like a horror movie they were killed off one by one. So a murder mystery.If not that they were on different planets and there was electricity and other modern things this book is more fantasy than sci-fi, I think that is why the author took the pains to depict the world but she did a terrible job. The final battle that everyone is raving about got tiring after the first five pages to read. When a book is written from only a one character's perspective its hard to imagine that person fighting for their life and still know what is happening with others. One part during that fight scene that annoyed me was when Gideon pick up her favourite type of sword and instead of fighting her foe she was reminiscing about the first time she used that sword and how awesome with the sword she is.The explanation of the necromancer sucks, we don't need that much details, there was no forward that explained the terms and the author didn't explain it in the book, words like thernagy and the rest, even Gideon the narrator was confused. I don't know about most of you but I only know the names of few of my bones, the author was using the names of the bones which was confusing.All in all this book was a disappointment, The Bone Witch did a better depiction of necromancer. Even the little depicted in Malazan was better than this whole book. This book is more about animating bones and less about bringing the dead back to life which I think is what necromancy is. The bones don't even remember their previous lives. Maybe the second book will explore more parts of necromancer but I doubt that.
3002129006	Poor characterization and an obnoxiously edgy narrative voice told within a mashup fantasy/sci fi setting with a hopelessly flimsy plot come together to showcase a terrible waste of a talented author's skills.Tamsyn Muir is a talented author, that much is clear. She is very clever with word craft and pithy dialogue to set up pretty fun scenes. I was pleased often to see how she used words in ways that I've never seen. She is quite skilled when it comes to describing characters or situations in round about ways that really make it pop in the reader's mind. I'm sorry to say the Gideon the Ninth is a waste of her talents.Having stated that I like a lot of her prose, the narrative voice in this work is obnoxious, too cool and overtly millennial. I understand it's is written this way to characterize Gideon. Well, job well done because it made me immediately dislike the protagonist. Just two quick examples: Gideon didn't like something to "which she could not have noped at harder." That kind of stuff is everywhere. There is literally a "that's what she said" joke in this book. Beyond being irritating, this narration creates a huge problem: it takes me completely out of the world building. On to my next point, the world building...The reader has no idea what this world is and where it takes place. I'm sure this is intentional. There are necromancers, rapiers used for duels, guns are obsolete for some reason, there is a big haunted fortress, tombs, magazines, comic books, temples, animated skeletons... Let this sink in: this is a world where the main character doesn't bat an eye at flying in a spaceship to another world but has literally never taken a bath. There's a scene where she doesn't know what to do with a bath tub. This is all terribly anachronistic or the world building is very flawed. Either way, doesn't work. I'm all for creative world building but it must be internally logical. Gideon the Ninth is a frenetic mashup of different genres. It doesn't work. There are too many characters brought right up front with almost no characterization. As the reader I'm supposed to keep track of nine houses and their heirs and guards? That's not happening without a little better conditioning and characterization. Muir puts in no work to differentiate these characters for me. This is even a bigger problem when it's not a plot driven story, but a character driven story like Gideon the Ninth. I was bored and confused. A lot. Gideon herself is well characterized because she has the benefit of being the only POV in the entire book. Here's the worst part: the plot is paper thin. Things only pick up when you're like 75% through. That is faaar to late. What even is the main plot? What is the story focus? It changes constantly. This starts out as some sort of origin story of a slave, an aristocracy and then its a small space faring adventure and then onto to some sort of tournament of Houses with sword battles and then... a murder mystery? What??This book is not good. I'm sorry to say it. I rarely give two stars and I really didn't want to but this was a waste of time for me. It's a shame because Muir is clearly a very talented writer. A strong story teller, she is not.
2842073891	This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionARC provided by the publisher in exchange of an honest review :D “Two is for discipline, heedless of trial; Three for the gleam of a jewel or a smile; Four for fidelity, facing ahead; Five for tradition and debts to the dead; Six for the truth over solace in lies; Seven for beauty that blossoms and dies; Eight for salvation no matter the cost; Nine for the Tomb, and for all that was lost.” 🌟 I am pretty sure this will be a huge hit when it is out. I can already see the Which House do you belong to quizzes, people getting tattoos according to their house and quotes being shared too! I developed a hunch over the last 4 years of which books work and which don’t. And although this one did not work for me, it will for many readers! That’s why you may want to take this review with a grain of salt!Here is some salt to do so 😛🌟 So let me get straight to the point, what determines whether you like this book or not is the writing style. A friend who I BR this was (He’s a real expert at Fantasy) could not relate to the story and DNF it early. I did not like it either but it was not bad as to make me DNF so I pushed through and after 300 pages, I could finally get into the story! If you like the writing style from the start then I assure you that it will be a very fun ride.Also is this supposed to be funny? I saw some attempts at that and knew I was supposed to laugh but I just… didn’t? I don’t easily laugh but I didn’t even smile. I can see some readers laughing so that should be good.🌟 The characters were also hard to relate to for me, I did care about a couple of characters and at the end I did care about the MC somehow! There are 9 houses and hence the name of the series and in each house there are at least 2 characters. That means a lot of characters!! I appreciate the glossary at the beginning containing all the houses and characters in them, if it was not there then I would have DNF it from confusion. There is something that I would have done if I were the editor of this book and that is consistently using the name or family name of characters and not just throwing them randomly. I mean there are over 15 characters and when the characters suddenly decide to use the family name I was confused AF and had to keep going back and forth between the glossary and the page I am reading.🌟 The plot however was good and I don’t think I have ever read a book with necromancers so it was a good and new experience, I have to admit that I was confused about some technical terms and about some scenes but after page 300, I was invested in the story and read it in a whole new spirit!🌟Summary: Despite all the negative things I said, I really appreciate that the effort that was taken to write this book as it did show from the cover till the last page! I can say that the first 300 Pages were not the best but after that I really enjoyed it and my rating actually approached 4 stars but I could not ignore the first 300 mentioned pages and decided to go for a rating in between. I am currently interested in the second book after thinking about this for a few days so I might actually give it a chance! I also think that many readers will like it so don’t let this review discourage you. The first few chapter are available online for free as I recall, try reading them and if you liked them then you will LOVE this!My first buddy with King Petrik of the House Leo, the First of His Name, King of Fantasy and the First Reviewers, The rightful king of the Seven Genres and Protector of the Books, Petrik of novel notions, Breaker of ARCs, Father of Dragons and regent of Goodreads
3819187756	“I cannot conceive of a universe without you in it.” “Yes you can, it's just less great and less hot,” said Gideon.omgggg where do i even start??? i first tried to read this about 3 years ago when i first got back into reading and i saw that dramatis personae and immediately noped out 😂 i just wasn't prepared for this level of high SFF worldbuilding, so i saved it for later.i'm glad i did that bc all my fantasy reading since better prepared me to start this series.“If you do not find yourself a galaxy, it is not so bad to find yourself a star.”the magic system is both mystical and meticulous; this is, to me, a true example of the blending of fantasy, sci-fi, and horror. macabre, eerie, calculated, mysterious. the well-placed elements of horror only add to the atmosphere and keep the stakes raised. as a reader you're constantly reassessing what you think you know of the canaan house alongside gideon.“Why was I born so attractive?” “Because everyone would have throttled you within the first five minutes otherwise.”gideon is honestly a hoot that i was not expecting. NO ONE TOLD ME THIS WAS FUNNY. if you know me, you know there's nothing i appreciate more than a fantasy book that also makes you laugh. death, destruction, the world and universe at peril are all great dramatics... but if the author can give me a moment of respite from it all to laugh and momentarily forget my favorite characters are in dangerous, i will be beholden to them forever.“Harrow,” said Gideon, “if my heart had a dick you would kick it.”gideon's tumultuous and resentful (though i think that word might be a bit light for what it describes) relationship to harrowhark, the ninth house heir, is similar in vein to damen x laurent of captive prince (i'm biased being permanently in capri brainrot but i swear the dynamics are parallel). deeply reluctant allies who are quite ready to betray the other if they ever got the chance, the tension starts high as they head into the canaan house as necromancer and cavalier.the mystery of canaan house itself and its ensuing deaths of attendants forces gideon and harrow to embark on the tightrope of a road to their friendship, to being a true cavalier and necromancer duo. the ensemble of characters were intriguing and illustrious, and thank god for authors who write a dramatis personae at the start of their books esp w names like those bc i had to constantly refer back to it to keep track. the twins were especially intriguing (and creepy) with their odd dynamic that i'm honestly still trying to figure out.with its intriguing and driving plot, unique world, and admirable characters, gideon the ninth is a must-read for any seasoned SFF fan.and with that ending, i'm definitely tuning into book 2.one flesh, one end.____________________probably my most anticipated read on my whole tbr rn (or at least has been on it the longest) !!
3119291556	Cioè sono 4 ma 5 perché Harrow.Che bomba assoluta
3640300436	This book was nothing like I was expecting, I'm still confused about how I felt but... I liked it?Don't really recommend the audiobook since the volume would go up and down and since I often listen to books while doing other things it was annoying to have to adjust it all the time.Will continue the series!
4122351123	What was that ending????????The first sci-fi book I’ve ever enjoyed! 🎉🎉This 👏 is 👏 how👏 you 👏 do 👏 enemies 👏 to 👏 lovers 👏Mmmm the relationships were just so good. The middle 50% was absolute perfection. Gideon is probably one of my new favorite characters. The last 25% was just crazy and maybe a little too rushed. All of the characters were so complex, but they all felt alive (or undead). Gideon’s humor is absolutely hilarious (but I apparently missed half of the references).I need more Gideon/Harrow!!!!!The next book better give it to me.1st reread notes:Loved it even more! There were so many bits of foreshadowing that I missed the first time around. Also solidified that I am an Ianthe simp.
3286026067	fuck it 5 stars this baby made me go feral in the best waywant to know more (aka watch me have a breakdown)? check out my reading vlog for this book and three other popular sapphic books here!
3217496308	So I enjoyed this book immensely, and it’s been a long time since I’ve fallen so deeply in love - real, actual love - with a protagonist. But while my heart says FIVE STARS! my head says three. There is a caveat to my final rating, and it boils down to the fact that I understood what was going on about 65% of the time. Even after finishing it I still struggle to picture how this world works socially and economically, and I’m also not sure why there needed to be any sci-fi angle to this. The sci-fi elements are very superficial and kind of pulled me out of the story; occasional mention of space shuttles was the only thing that reminded me of the sci-fi backdrop (I use the term “backdrop” very loosely). It took me a while to get my bearings with this one, and while it wasn’t difficult to understand the basic plot, I feel like some reveals and twists were lost on me. I found the set pieces, magic system, and general social politics a bit muddy: the necromancers all come from different planets? Is that it? How is that even feasible? And why are we still using swords when we have space shuttles? Why don’t the cavaliers even have basic armour or protection? Are there magic types outside of necromancy, and if so, why aren’t the cavaliers magically gifted? It would make more sense than having a single mortal soldier to inexplicably be the last line of defence for a magical death witch. Because of this, I missed certain plot points and found it difficult to remember who was who. I was so distracted with trying to understand the context that some of the big revelations just didn’t hold the intended weight. I like to know why things are happening, not just that they are, so while some parts genuinely shocked and thrilled me, others fell flat. That said, the characters were so much fun. To make it even better, the audio narration of this was note perfect. Moira Quirk so effortlessly captures Gideon’s strong, funny, and endearing voice. This is also a brilliantly written book; while some of the dialogue might have come off as corny in a different setting, it’s tempered with enough maturity in the descriptive prose to maintain the book’s adult feel. The characters’ sense of humour really makes this story shine, and it strikes a perfect balance between seriousness and silliness. To put it succinctly, this was a flawed and excellent ride, and I’m looking at the sequel the way Gideon looks at her two-handed sword.
3296240679	Okay. I’m done. We did it. Firstly let me say, having flown through the last 200 pages, my struggle in the first 200 was warranted. It takes a lot of work and searching for context and world building before you finally realize none of it matters. I understand much better why no one has been able to summarize this book, because to summarize it at all is to spoil it. What I will say is that if you DNF in the first 150 pages, this is a 1 Star book. If you get to 250 pages, it’s a 3 star book. And if you do finish, if it not exactly a 5, it’ll stick with you for the rest of your life. Now a question to the author... are you okay?Edit: upon reread, this is my favorite book of all time. It’s meant to be reread, there was so much to be gained.
4634690153	I’m on BookTube! =)"Oh, I have hurt your heart," she said.Gideon kept it absolutely level. "I boohooed for hours.""It won't be the last time I make you weep."Okay, so “Gideon the Ninth” is definitely a book I have troubles to review because 1.) It’s unlike any other book I ever read and 2.) Most of the time I was super confused and really had to make an effort to be able to follow the plotline. XD Like seriously, all those different names and the houses plus the mere fact that most of the characters went by 3 or 4 different names/nicknames made this really tough to read. I think due to this the writing style was very hard to get into at first and it took me a little while until I could connect with the story. (I mean we have 9 Houses after all) Not to mention Tamsyn Muir’s unique writing style in general. Sometimes I had to read a sentence thrice to actually understand what was happening. (Maybe it was just my tired brain though, so *lol*) Also there were a lot of scenes when you read the scene but afterwards you’re none the wiser. If that makes sense?! (view spoiler)[For instance that scene with Gideon and Harrow!! I mean, did they have sex or not?! XD This was one of those typical scenes when the author beats about the bush and you have no idea if there actually happened anything or not. I. Am. Confusion. *lol* Or that fight with the 6th House that actually didn’t happen in the end?! (hide spoiler)]"Oh, this is boring," Gideon had said in disappointment. "I wanted one with a skull puking another, smaller skull, and other skulls flying all around. But tasteful, you know?"As for the premise of the book: There was barely any action happening in space, it was basically limited to two planets and not actually in space and the lesbian representation, was there but vague and not very pronounced. I mean we get a couple of Gideon’s dirty thoughts but they are almost chaste in comparison to what I usually read. I guess my mind would have been way dirtier than Gideon’s, but let’s not go down that road and focus on the book instead. ;-P What “Gideon the Ninth” definitely had a lot of was necromancy and suspense! I kinda loved the murder mystery vibe we got in here and all the interesting details about the necromantic world and how it works. ”If you want to know what I think ... I think that you’re a cavalier worthy of a Lyctor. I want to see that, what you’d become. I wonder if the Reverend Daughter even knows what she has in you?”If I got it right there are nine houses and every one of them is specialized on some area of necromancy which was very intriguing to me. Also the description of how it works and what you have to do in order to move dead corpses etc. was super interesting. You could tell Tamsyn Muir put a lot of thought and effort into her world building and even though it was sometimes very confusing I really liked that love for science and detail. Because yes, if you break it down to the basics necromancy seems to be a science and I loved how Muir made sure to convey that to her readers. "I must no longer accept," she said slowly, "being a stranger to you.""Whoa, whoa, whoa," said Gideon, sudden sweat prickling the back of her neck, "yes you can, you once told me to dig myself an ice grave. Stop before this gets weird."Of course Gideon and Harrow are the main characters of the book and it’s told from Gideon’s POV, which made Harrow quite a mysterious character and added a lot to the atmosphere. I was such a sucker for their interactions because Harrow always seems to be annoyed by everything Gideon does and Gideon just doesn’t get her. Sometimes they were on the same page though and whenever that happened it was either a lot of fun or very serious business. It was really nice to see how they developed from enemies-to-friends and I’m using that description on purpose because this certainly wasn’t your typical enemies-to-lovers arc and I’m not even sure what they would have defined themselves as by the end of the book. *lol* We’ll just leave it at that. ”Well, all I can say is thank the Tomb that nobody knows you’re not really one of ours. If I didn’t know that, I’d be saying that you were Matthias Nonius come again or something equally saccharine.”“Harrow,” said Gideon, finding her tongue, “don’t say these things to me. I still have a million reasons to be mad at you. It’s hard to do that and worry that you got brain injured.”“I’m merely saying you’re an incredible swordswoman,” said the necromancer briskly. “You’re still a dreadful human being.”“Okay, cool, thanks,” said Gideon. “Damage done though.”When it comes to the other characters in the book I’ve to say that Palamedes and Camilla (6th House) as well as Magnus and Abigail (5th House) were my favourites. Even though I’ve to admit that Palamedes and Camilla kinda won the crown for me. Camilla was such a badass cavalier and an amazing fighter and Palamedes won me over with his calm, gentle, compassionate and inquiring nature. I love that man! Period! *lol* Go find yourself a Palamedes. ;-P Anyway, back on track! The coolest duo in this book were definitely Gideon and Harrow though! When they set their minds on something those two rocked the show and I really want to see more of them?! Please, can we have more of them Tamsyn Muir?! ”I’m not running, Harrow!”“Of course we’re not running,” said Harrowhark disdainfully. “I said a necromancer alone. I have you. We bring hell.”All told “Gideon the Ninth” was unlike any other book I ever read and therefore very unique. The action sequences and especially the name dropping were sometimes really confusing, but in general I enjoyed to read this and had a great time. The tension and distrust between the different necromancers and the mystery element that ran like a golden thread through the entire book added a nice touch to the atmosphere as well and some of the plot twists were actually really surprising. I don’t know about you, but I’m looking forward to read book two! ;-)_______________________________Believe me when I say that I never read a book like this... ever! “Gideon the Ninth” was so unique and I really enjoyed it! Admittedly the writing style was very hard to get into at first, but all the lesbian energy and tension between the necromancers in space definitely made up for it. *lol* And I loved the mystery element plus Gideon! Gideon was the best! <3Full RTC soon! Stay tuned! =)________________________________I legit just borrowed this from my library but it’s already pre-ordered again and now I need to read this in two weeks. Oh joy! *lol*Anyway! I wanted to read “Gideon the Ninth” for quite a while now and the book even made it on my 2021 TBR so I guess it’s about time to finally read it. XD The things I know about the book: necromancy, lesbians and space. That’s it, but it sounds intriguing enough for me. ;-) Apparently you either love “Gideon the Ninth” or you hate it so I’m curious where I’ll stand once I finished reading it. Fingers crossed it will be a good one.
2532246450	Fuck, fuck, fuck.Gideon the Ninth was one of my most anticipated reads of the year. I mean.. how could I not get excited for lesbian necromancers in space?! With a fantasy feel? YES PLEASE!Unfortunately.. it was a complete letdown, which breaks my queer little heart!Gideon the Ninth is a DNF for me. I struggled through 165 pages. Life is too short to waste on books that you aren't vibing with! I've finally allowed myself to listen to my own advice lately! There are a fuck ton of books out there to fall in love with. Rather than continue to be a completionist and read books just for the sake of getting through it.. it is perfectly okay to move onto something else if a book just isn't doing it for me these days.The hype machine is REAL with this book. Goddamn. PLUS THE FINISHED HARDCOVER WITH THE SPRAYED EDGES IS SO FUCKING GORGEOUS!! But.. I'm me. I wouldn't be me if I wasn't honest about how utterly disappointed I was in this. For real. Imagine my surprise when I began reading this and it feeling like an angsty CW show that is trying wicked hard to be edgy.I'M EDGY MCEDGERSON. LOOK AT HOW EDGY I AM!!I fucking LOVE snarky, sarcastic, moody characters. ::points to self:: HELLO!! However, I just couldn't deal with Gideon's voice. It felt incredibly YA to me. Not that there is anything wrong with that - I just personally am not into it. She annoyed the fuck out of me.This book is getting no shortage of amazing reviews and star ratings so, as always, YMMV.(Thanks to Tor.com Publishing for sending me a copy in exchange for an honest review!)
3670998432	Gelato? Non ho capito il gioco, no, scusate interrompete.Bello eh, originale, figo, Gideon e Harrow strabone... però per me il worldbuilding e il sistema magico devono essere un attimo più chiari nel primo libro di una serie, altrimenti la confusione regna sovrana e dopo un po' la lettura rischia di diventare frustrante (ma riconosco che questo elemento alla fine è anche il grande punto di forza del libro). Non è un libro da 5 stelle per me ma comunque è super consigliato, soprattutto se vi piacciono le storie davvero assurde, bizzarre, intricate e diverse dal solito.
6228414141	AMAZING!!! I cannot fully articulate how much I loved this. It’s so weird and confusing at times, with a huge cast of characters that was hard to keep track of, and there were many times where I was completely lost in the plot, but I was obsessed the entire time. It’s about Gideon, a swordswoman enslaved since childhood, and takes place in a universe at war where necromancy is the norm in the remaining royal houses. When the emperor calls on the heirs of each house to a deadly trial where the winner ascends to immortality, Gideon is forced to go by her childhood nemesis/necromancer: Harrowhark. Obviously there’s a lot more to it than that, and this is the first book in a series so I have a lot of unanswered questions, but when I tell you I’m OBSESSED!!! I’m going to be shoving this down everyone’s throats for the foreseeable future. It is a pretty slow burn focused more on character development, cryptic world-building, and there’s a puzzle solving/murder mystery aspect in regards to the trial, but MAN does it have some exciting action sequences and absolutely insane body horror!!! I mostly listened to the audiobook, but there were some fight scenes (esp at the end) that were so creative and had so much imaginative body horror and gore that I had to just reread them over and over again to get a clear picture of what was being described. It’s insane. Tasmyn is such a skilled writer, I was actually in awe.The character development was honestly my favorite part though, and I teared up a few times near the end. It’s also funny, mostly thanks to Gideon’s dirty mouth and inability to take anything seriously. I can’t say enough good things about it, and will be starting book 2 asap 🫡
4151858752	(Los que me conocéis y leéis mis reseñas sabéis que adoro poner buenas y llamativas citas para atraer. Aquí ni eso, se me quitaron las ganas.)Me aburrió. No fue un libro para mi y su lectura mucho menos. No me enganchó, ni lo disfruté. Me aburrí como una ostra. Pensé "igual soy yo y no el libro" y pause. Volví. Me seguía si enganchar y me aburría aún más, como una ostra sola en medio de un mar sin vida, vacío. Aburrido, confuso, perdido, sin sentido, leí por leer. Esta es mi opinión, puede que no fuera una lectura para mi o el momento adecuado. Pero desde luego no fue lo que esperaba ya que terminó siendo una decepción. Esto no quiere decir que os vaya a pasar lo mismo, vamos allá:Un "hype" algo desmedido, no conecte con nada de esta historia, trama y personajes. Como algún amigo tomo el camino de nota discordante, quizás con más dureza en esta trama rara y confusa. Tenemos interesantes términos nigromanticos, raros que no le aportaron nada cuando los usa demasiado. Deja bastantes cosas sin explorar, y me he perdido a lo largo de la trama. Una falta de información que llevo a mi perdida total en su lectura. El principio me costó entrar en la historia, tenía o le veía cierto potencial pero me la pegué como un campeón. Al final del libro hay ciertas cosas encajan y veo que, Harrow su continuación puede ser una mejor lectura. He leído cosas más densas y complicadas pero están ejecutadas de manera eficaz, algunas magistrales. Y aquí me he perdido, vale que no soy una mente privilegiada de matrícula de honor pero leñe paso el nivel tabla de multiplicar. Una caracterización para mi medio deficiente y una voz narrativa algo rara y acelerada contada dentro de un entorno cóctel fantasía / CF con una trama endeble. Todo esto se une para mostrar un terrible desperdicio de las buenas habilidades de un autora talentosa, lo reconozco. Pero el resultado para mi como lector, ha fallado, le falta lo más importante engancharme, disfrutar un mínimo e interes por querer terminar. Quizás soy yo y no el libro. Tiene gracia porque le veo más potencial al siguiente de Harrow, quizás caiga ya veré, ganas no muchas.Tamsyn Muir es una autora talentosa, eso está claro no voy a venir de flipado a negarlo. Ella fue inteligente y precisa con ideas muy interesantes que llaman la atención, la creación de personajes y los diálogos con su punto "divertido". Hábil cuando se trata de describir a los personajes y situaciones en formas que realmente los hacen aparecer en la mente del lector. Pero lamento decir que esto no es suficiente si ya de por si falla en la base. Además de que las expectativas que tenía que por suerte me fueron bajando gracias a los amigos y amigas que les defraudo, otros y coincido, no era lo que me esperaba, incluso iendo apenas sin expectativas.La prosa de la autora me gusta al igual que sus ideas que fue lo que me atrajo de este inicio de saga, pero la voz narrativa me pareció demasiado fría y millennial y esas geniales ideas no fueron integradas como yo esperaba. Entiendo que está escrito de esta manera y una de las razones es para caracterizar a Gideon. Bueno pues trabajo bien hecho porque no me terminó de gustar y convencer la protagonista. Tiene potencial pero se me queda corto, algunas veces irrita y es curioso que alguien que debería sacarme una sonrisa me irrite, o vuelvo a la palabra mágica cosas que me parecieron raras y me sacaron de la trama. No soy muy compatible con el humor de este libro ni con la historia que se desarrolla y prefiero no hablar de los personajes.. 😬Como lector no tuve ni idea de qué es este mundo y como consecuencia me perdí, deja varias cosas sin explorar, algún cabo atas cuando terminas pero repito ha sido un conjunto raro, en una lectura rara en la que me perdí y fui perdiendo las ganas. Estoy seguro de que esto es intencional por parte de la autora, a muchos les gusta a mi no. Tenemos muchos nigromantes, espadas, duelos, las armas obsoletas por alguna razón, hay una gran fortaleza encantada, muchas tumbas, sus revistas, templos, esqueletos animados. Tenemos naves espaciales en las que la protagonista viaja a otros mundos sin inmutarse, con ese conocimiento y sin embargo, no sabe que hacer o como usar una bañera, porque nunca se ha bañado. Todo esto me pareció terriblemente anacrónico. La construcción del mundo tiene muchos defectos. No ha logrado funcionar, al menos para mi. Estoy a favor de la construcción de un mundo creativo, novedoso, pero debe ser lógico para mi como lector. Gideon es una mezcla algo frenética de diferentes géneros. La construcción de mundo dejo mucho que desear.La explicación de los diferentes planetas y las diferentes castas y personas que los habitan se desdibuja hasta la insignificancia. Algunos cosas las sentí descuidadas. Hay referencias a la cultura pop pero curiosamente, algunos personajes ni siquiera saben qué es un fregadero, una bañera o como usar dichas cosas. No sé, una de las muchas cosas que me llevo a esa confusión y decir que película estoy viendo, donde me he metido.. raro.. muy raro. 🤷‍♂️Aparecen demasiados personajes sin casi ninguna caracterización. Como lector, debo saber, seguir o al menos interesarme en un seguimiento de esas nueve casas, de sus herederos y guardianes. Eso no sucede sin una mejor caracterización y desarrollo. Tuve cierta dificultad para diferenciar a todos esos personajes. Y esto fue un problema porque no es una historia que se apoye en la trama, sino que se apoya en los personajes, este es un libro de personajes. Llegó un punto que estaba aburrido y confundido a partes iguales. La protagonista, Gideon está bien caracterizada porque es el único punto de vista en todo el libro.A medida que avanza esta aventura de Gideon y Harrow se vuelve más extraña, también lo hace el voluminoso elenco de personajes del libro, la gran mayoría de los cuales solo aparecen cuando es más conveniente, sus conflictos personales son sencillos y relativamente leves. Desafortunadamente, eso solo subraya lo realmente subdesarrollado que está Gideon la Novena.Las cosas solo mejoran cuando estás en un 80% del libro. Eso es demasiado tarde. Los conflictos están llegando a un punto crítico y todo está finalmente estallando. Si Gideon la Novena se hubiera apegado a esta trama que alcanzó en este momento desde el principio, quizas habría sido una mejor lectura y merecedora por mi parte de más puntuación. Pero esta trama este interés llega demasiado tarde, y para entonces, estaba tan aburrido que me dio igual. 😐El enfoque de la trama, la propia historia principal, todo cambia y de manera constante. Da comienzo como una historia de origen, una aristocracia, luego es una aventura en el espacio, luego una especie de torneo de casas con batallas y luego un misterio de asesinatos. He leído libros con cambios, algunos hasta drásticos pero integrados en la historia de manera que son efectivos y tienen un muy buen resultado, entendible como mínimo.Desafortunadamente, las esperanzas que tenía en el libro se desvanecieron sin rastro en los primeros capítulos. Tiene un comienzo que me resultó un tanto desigual. Una jerga inexplicable, tan densa como rara. Mis muchos, muchos intentos de darle un sentido de poder entender esta historia y lo que en ella se plantea se vieron arruinados y lo declaré misión abortada. Un libro desconcertante. 🤦‍♂️La manera en la que se me presento al principio "Gideon la Novena" lo que parecía que iba a ser no es exactamente una afirmación inexacta, sino más bien, endeble. ¿Hay nigromantes lesbianas? Más o menos es un tema que se menciona en cada pagina pero no se habla de ello de manera explícita. Se dio publicidad cuando llamo mi atención como lesbianas nigromantes en el espacio, pero ni Gideon ni ningún otro personaje hacen apenas referencia a estos temas, se me quedo en humo.¿Gideon y sus revistas guarras? Sí vale también, ¿La parte espacial? Meh deja mucho que desear. Me pareció al principio una premisa más seductora y le tenía sus ganas pero no llegó ni resulto nada satisfactorio para mi.Bueno, Gideon no has sido para mi pero te deseo toda la suerte y a tus continuaciones. Queridos amigos y amigas ahora si me disculpais tengo un Abercrombie 🤤 y un Posteguillo 🤩 esperándome. Aquí os lo dejo, todo para vosotros..🙋‍♂️
6621638289	Super solid read. First few parts were def confusing haha but the immersion read actually helped with this for sure and the way it came to an end was interesting. I might have to check out Harrow the Ninth to see how the story continues.Solid 4/5
2823818683	I’m writing this review at 2am so bear with me. This book is everything I have ever wanted. Necromancy? Here for it. Lesbians? Always down. A badass fantasy/sci-fi turned whodunnit? YES. This book was casually riding the 4 star train up until I hit 75%. At that point I planned on going to sleep (reader I did not go to sleep). I stayed up for an extra 2 hours (I think) to finish this book. The end plot twists had me shouting in my bedroom (sorry dad) and stopping to take deep breaths. The characters are absolutely fantastic and the storyline is so original and fresh. Everything about this book is one big *chef’s kiss*. If you take away anything from this review I hope it’s the urge to preorder. Because you absolutely should. (Special thanks to the publisher who sent me an e-arc to read and review and also to Rhiannon for all but putting this book in my hands)
2658719637	confirmed: this book is properly batshit insane. Edit: I've come to realise that actually the best term for Gideon the Ninth is that it's a Hot Mess. In that Gideon is hot and Harrow is a mess. Also in that the narrative is a hot mess in what is a largely good way but also an inexplicably confusing way at some points. It is a Ride and yes, I loved Gideon x Harrow's relationships and quips. I was slightly less sold on the worldbuilding and what was going on. I thought the pacing was slack at points. Nevertheless, I've never read anything like it and I think highly of the fact that this quirky, incredibly queer book has stoked up an incredibly passionate and vocal fandom. That's talent. ty to hollis for getting that arc into my hands so long ago - what a start to the friendship, lol
3201782584	4.25ish stars.For all its faults, this book is pure entertainment. It's a cool set-up from the get-go, and offers a new spin on classic fantasy/sci-fi tropes such as separating the world into different "houses" with various unique characteristics. The main thing is that the story itself is just really well-written. It's fun, exciting, and at about the halfway point it's absolutely gripping. It's also a kind of a sample platter of genre fiction; it's fantasy but there are also elements of horror, sci-fi, crime and mystery. I'm impressed that Muir was able to take such a large cast of characters and, for the most part, give them distinct voices that allowed me to remember them. Which is hard for me. It's also kind of sloppy. Like all over the place. While it's exciting and entertaining, it often crosses a line and becomes manic. And then there's the dialogue. Much of the time the banter is funny, but the main character, Gideon, uses a lot of anachronistic phrases that are meant to be cleverly absurd but came off to me as being jarring and smug. Sometimes it's outright obnoxious shtick. And sometimes it doesn't even make sense, it's just there to be endearingly naughty, I guess?:“...the room was colder than ten witches’ tits.” Is that an expression? Am I out of the loop? What's the difference in temperature between nine witches' tits and eleven witches' tits? (Edit: I have been informed that "colder than a witch's tit" is in fact a real expression. I learn something new every day!)So yeah there are some things that bugged me, but the amount of fun I had made it worth it in the end. A solid debut by Muir.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library
3176774805	“I pray the tomb is shut forever, I pray the rock is never rolled away. I pray that which was buried remains buried, insensate, in perpetual rest, with closed eye and stilled brain. I pray it lives, I pray it sleeps ... I pray for the needs of the Emperor All-Giving, the Undying King, His Virtues and his men. I pray for the Second House, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth; the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth. I pray for the Ninth House, and I pray for it to be fruitful. I pray for the soldiers and adepts far from home, and all those parts of the Empire that live in unrest and disquiet. Let it be so.” ______Well, it's only February, but if I handed out a nonexistent award for hardest book to rate/review of the year, it would almost certainly go to Gideon the Ninth. Let me start with a little story. I first heard about this book in January of last year. It was on a list of then upcoming science fiction and fantasy novels the editors of the blog were most anticipating. The description... well, it had me intrigued to say the least. I preordered the book and when it was about time for the release, I finished up the book I was reading double time just to make sure I could start it the day it came out. The book arrived while I was at work and I went home, opened it and started reading the second I could. I continued it the next day and put it down on the third. Maybe, I thought, I'm just not in the mood for this.It's been months with no real desire to pick it up again. I finally did as I've been trying to cross off some of the books that have been sitting on my shelf for a bit. Round 2: well this time I finished it, but there were at least two points where I almost gave up again.Now you may be wondering, why the high score for a book that you did give up on once, and almost gave up on the second try?It's time to break out my infrequently used pros and cons format for this review (or in this case cons and pros):ConsIt starts off with a bang and then gets really, really slow. I mean the middle of this book draaaaaags. I'm all for buildup, I'm all for taking your time, but seriously, this wore down my patience for a bit. This is further complicated by the next con.It doesn't feel like it knows what it wants to be. Is it a gothic horror, a comedy of manners, a locked door mystery, a science fiction epic about the politics between various houses... something else entirely? Please, I found myself asking, please pick one so we can actually start the plot proper. Seriously, it was almost halfway into the book before I felt like it was finally starting to get its groove.Continuing on the not knowing what it wants to be... who exactly was this book written for? It feels at times borderline YA-ish, but then proceeds to have material that places it FIRMLY in the adult category. I keep hearing the term "new adult" floating around, and perhaps that is the answer, but in terms of tone, the book just feels inconsistent. False advertising - Okay, maybe that's stretching it a bit, but if you look at the cover, the prominent blurb states "Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted Gothic palace in space!" I appreciate that it sounds pulpy as hell, but it feels like setting up for a different book. Don't get me wrong, it is technically correct. There is a Gothic palace, there are necromancers, there is in fact space travel and Gideon certainly shows interest in other women... but if anyone think that Gideon's sexuality will be a major part of the story, they will be disappointed. While it certainly doesn't come off as an afterthought, it is not the focus of the book, and the relationship that seems to be highlighted is unhealthy to say the least. Finally, the "mystery" was too easy to solve. No spoilers, I won't comment on how, but I literally figured out the "who" within 20 pages after this aspect started. Pros:The sense of humor! During the early portions where the book was really dragging, this is what kept me going. The comedy is very well done (or at least appealing to my darker sense of humor) and had me genuinely laughing at some points.The characters. This book has a fascinating variety of characters. Some fall into classic tropes, others defy them. Each brings something to the book, and characters I didn't even like still managed to offer something noteworthy for me. World building. Oh sweet undying Emperor, the world building. This is easily the biggest highlight for me. The world presented here is fascinating, deep and at times absolutely bizarre. It's a fascinating place the author has created and I hope we get an in-depth look at it in future books.The plot. Yes, yes, I complained about it above, but here is where I point to the fact that I said "the halfway point" is when it finally kicked into gear. When it did, I delighted in it. I found myself engrossed in the goings on in the palace and each new room revealed. The puzzles, the feuding, the borderline terrifying use examples of necromancy on display. That was delightful.I've been giving this book a great deal of thought over the past few days. I've debated on the rating multiple times, feeling sure some days it would get a two or three star rating. Yet here we are and I'm giving it a four and here's the main reason why: Tamsyn Muir got off on a shaky start in this book. It feels like she wasn't confident in it at first and played with different styles hoping it would find a voice. At a certain point it did, and from that point on it's a confident voice that gives absolutely zero shits what you think of it. It becomes a bold book, a book unafraid of throwing cosmic horror and disturbing imagery into something that had been relatively tame in that regard. It's a book that paints a grinning skull on its face and walks around in public giving a middle finger salute to anyone gawking at it. It's the sort of book that, once it finds itself, is perfectly content with what it is and it is refreshing.Gideon the Ninth will likely become a cult classic (fitting given the nature of the Ninth). It's something of a mess, but once it gets to where it needs to go, a delightful one; with its Gothic (not to mention modern goth) sensibilities, as well as both a science fiction and fantasy setting, it certainly creates a unique read. Will I read the sequel? Hell yes, and I sincerely hope it will stay with that bolder voice throughout. (view spoiler)[Also, major points to the author for managing to make a line like: "We do bones motherfucker" come off as the most badass one-liner imaginable given the context. (hide spoiler)]
2887449325	Well the space part is irrelevant. The lesbian part comes up but not really anything major. The part that is really the whole focus of the book is necromancy. While convoluted in the beginning by the end I was following 85% of things; the rest I assume is fairly irrelevant. This wraps up many questions, but not all. I have two large questions that I assume book 2 or 3 will answer. Gore and writing style reminded me of Black Panther, Red Wolf (which I also loved). But a lot less sex and innuendos. Very different books and casts of characters but the complexity are close to one another. I keep telling myself I will write a comprehensive review of Gideon the Ninth (better than what's written above). But then I realize that I don't want to say too much as it will take away from the reading experience. So I'm leaving it as is. I will add this I think this book is AMAZING. It won't be for everyone but it hits high on my best books ever list. It's complex, gory, deadly, and overall heartbreaking. Not for the faint of heart.
5674014162	4.5 ⭐️„Гидеон Девета“ е много готина книга и силно начало на поредица! Тя се оказа очарователно съчетание на мрачно фентъзи, научна фантастика и криминална мистерия. Страшно напрегнатата атмосфера в романа се допълва от страхотно чувство за хумор. Гидеон е отлично изградена главна героиня и ми стана доста симпатична. Нейните перипетии в некромантската вселена са изпълнени със страховити опасности и вълнуващи обрати...„Да се държим както подобава за Гидеон означаваше да бъдем потайни и неразбираеми и маниакално обсебени от древни томове.“„Внезапно ѝ се прииска да чуе някоя от ужасните шеги на Пети, дори само защото това щеше да бъде освежаващо завръщане към статуквото.“„Но Гидеон изпитваше една могъща емоция: беше ѝ писнало от глупостите на всички...“„— Не мога да го направя.— Ти вече го направи — каза Гидеон. — Готово е. Ти ме погълна и ме изгради наново. Вече не можем да се върнем.“„— Но ти си Господ — каза Хароу.И Господ рече:— И не съм достатъчен.“
3375372204	Voto effettivo: 4.75 stelline.IO MI SONO INNAMORATA, RAGA.Ve lo dico con tutta la calma del mondo *Sara prende un megafono ed inizia ad urlare*: LEGGETE GIDEON THE NINTH. Okay, okay, ora mi calmo e cerco di scrivere qualcosa di coerente, anche se la vedo dura.Gideon the Ninth è quanto di più strano io abbia letto negli ultimi anni, e nel miglior modo possibile. E' un libro che butta in un frullatore fantascienza, fantasy, mystery e horror, da una bella frullatina e ti presenta il miglior milkshake della tua vita.Sembra stato scritto con i miei gusti in mente e non mi capacito di come Tamsyn Muir sia stata capace di prendere la mia essenza e buttarla pari pari tra le pagine del suo romanzo.Ci sono Negromanti strafighi nello spazio, suore mummificate, sfide mortali e misteri oscuri. Già solo leggendo questa frase mi sarei potuta innamorare.Il libro parla di Gideon Nav, una spadaccina orfana della Nona Casa, posto che odia con tutto il suo cuore e in cui vive la sua nemesi: la Reverenda Figlia Harrowhark Nonagesimus, negromante straordinaria che riesce a controllare e rianimare le ossa."Nav, show them what the Ninth House does.""We do bones, motherfucker."Quindi partiamo da personaggi che si odiano, una delle mie cose preferite al mondo, ma andiamo avanti: L'imperatore richiama da tutto lo spazio coppie di Negromanti e Cavalieri per competere in delle sfide che potrebbero farli ascendere allo stato di semidivinità immortale, quindi Gideon (controvoglia) e Harrow partono per questo pianeta dove finirà per succedere di tutto. Sono seria: di tutto!Sono sincera, la storia inizialmente è un po' difficile da digerire perchè il mondo è super complesso e strano come poche cose al mondo, ma una volta superato questo diventa una bomba stratosferica.Ora ecco a voi una breve (si, come no) lista di tutto ciò che ho amato del libro:GIDEON THE NINTH: Gideon è uno dei miei nuovi personaggi preferiti di sempre. E' semplicemente iconica! Mi ha fatto ridere a crepapelle e contemporaneamente mi ha dato emozioni fortissime. Gideon odia la Nona Casa e più di tutto al mondo odia Harrow, quindi potete immaginare benissimo quanto possa amare doverle fare da cavaliere fedele in una competizione che potrebbe costarle il collo. Vivere nella sua testa è meraviglioso e voglio un amica con il suo senso dell'umorismo. Boh, da un lato mi sento molto lei perchè ho davvero lo stesso carattere over the top e spesso senza senso. E' fantastica: totalmente innamorata della sua spada, odia praticamente tutto ciò che ha a che fare con la Nona Casa ed è Queer as fuck. PORTA PURE GLI OCCHIALI DA SOLE MA CHE VI STO A DIRE, LA SI DEVE AMARE E BASTA.“Why was I born so attractive?” “Because everyone would have throttled you within the first five minutes otherwise,”HARROW: Può asfaltarmi quando vuole, masticarmi e sputarmi a terra, prendere tutte le mie ossa e farci una collana. Le direi anche grazie.Parte come una stronza super fredda che per qualche misterioso motivo odia Gideon come se non ci fosse un domani, e più o meno rimane sia fredda che stronza...ma impariamo a conoscerla e comprenderla e in tutto questo casino io ho finito per innamorarmi. Sarà stato il fatto che indossa un corsetto fatto di una gabbia toracica umana? Probabilmente lo stile della Nona Casa avrà aiutato.“Gideon marvelled that someone could live in the universe only seventeen years and yet wear black and sneer with such ancient self-assurance.”L'ATMOSFERA: Questo libro è dark, crudo, sanguinolento e misterioso. Non vi piacciono queste cose? Probabilmente non fa per voi. Io invece credo di aver iniziato a respirare nebbia ed essenza di omicidio di prima mattina, per cui questo è diventato il mio pane quotidiano.“She had left Harrowhark a note on her vastly underused pillow— WHATS WITH THE SKULLS? and received only a terse— Ambiance.”IL ROMANCE: Okay, praticamente il romance non esiste perchè è il più grande slow burn del secolo, ma il mio piccolo cuoricino nero è comunque a ballare una macarena in cielo tra le stelle. RAGA E' L'HATE TO LOVE MIGLIORE DEL SECOLO ED E' ANCHE QUEER, PIANGO ARCOBALENI.“One flesh, one end, bitch.”IL SISTEMA MAGICO: Ragazzi io non avevo la minima idea che si potesse sfruttare la figura del negromante in un contesto fantascientifico così bene. Abbiamo 9 Case, ognuna delle quali è governata da un tipo diverso di Negromante e SONO TUTTI ASSURDI. Io con tutta probabilità sarei morta dopo 0.1 secondi in questo mondo, ma non posso fare a meno di ammirare Tamsyn Muir per averlo creato.Ora passiamo ai contro:NON CI SONO. No, okay, mi ridimensiono. L'unico motivo per il quale non ho dato un 5 stelline piene al libro è l'andamento delle prime 50 pagine.Lento e difficile da seguire, capisco come possa mettere il lettore in una situazione sfavorevole. Vi prego, vi scongiuro, andate avanti. Non ve ne pentirete.In realtà devo essere onesta ed ammettere che secondo me Gideon the Ninth non è un libro per tutti. Prima di tutto per i motivi che vi ho citato in precedenza, cioè il fatto che è estremamente crudo. E non parlo di "oh mio dio, è schizzato un po' di sangue su una parete" ma di organi ovunque, scudi di carne umana e cose del genere. In secondo luogo è scritto in un modo molto particolare ed i personaggi che io ho tanto amato potrebbero risultare odiosi per altri perchè hanno un carattere davvero particolare. Inoltre il genere è un ibrido che potrebbe confondere invece che coinvolgere.Ovviamente questo non è stato il mio caso, quindi se di solito vi rispecchiate nei miei gusti vi dico di correre a comprare Gideon the Ninth (in particolar modo consigliato se vi sono piaciute le serie di Illuminae, Stalking Jack the Ripper, Nevernight e Aurora Rising).Sicuramente questa recensione non avrà il minimo di senso per la maggior parte delle persone che la leggerà, ma d'altro canto questo è un libro difficile da spiegare. Il fulcro del discorso è:LEGGETELO.Punto.Fine.Altrimenti vi vengo a cercare (si, è una minaccia).
2817201285	I’ll be honest, I don’t even know how to summarize this book. I don’t even know how to review this book. All I know is that Gideon the Ninth may just be my favorite book in 2019, maybe ever since Strange the Dreamer. This book took me by complete surprise, especially as I was originally put off by the beginning few chapters.This book kind of just drops you in this large, extensive world without a guide, and while I was originally quite lost, you very quickly learn to just go along with the characters and plot and trust the author to give you the pieces as you need them. Even after finishing I don’t have a clear picture of the world and how it’s set up, but I believe the intrigue is quite important to the story and how it will develop later on. There was also a lot of in depth necromancy talk, which was sometimes like reading a science textbook too high above your level, but it was understandable enough to get the story + it wasn’t necessary to fully get it either, as the character you’re following doesn’t get it all either. The characters were also all quite well-rounded and haunting in how real they felt, you came to understand all of their motivations (even if you don’t agree with them all), and you come to feel for their pain and their mistakes. Almost every single character was explored and given an in depth background, meaning you were always aware of the people at play in scenes and situations. It all also tied well into their actions and emotions, making the story feel overall consistent. Our two main characters, Gideon and Harrowhark, also had such an interesting relationship, and the exploration of that alone made this book fantastic. The prose, while being something to get used to, was also beautiful in a quite unique way. It was quite dense prose, describing almost everything and using long chains of large paragraphs and stretching sentences, but was constantly broken up by Gideon’s trademark sarcasm. While snarky and sarcastic characters are very quickly getting old, Gideon was her own brand of witty, and there were many serious moments made hilarious by a small snide comment on her end. It was just fantastic. The plot was also fantastic, as it kept winding and twisting throughout the entire novel, never truly settling in any one place. It was a journey both for the characters and the reader, even as they stayed in one place. It was also just an extremely well-constructed plot, the answers to every question hidden in every part of the storyline. While some reveals were shocking, none were pulled from nothing and everything had more than enough build up and time to truly form. It was also just an extremely thrilling and gripping plot. From page 200 onwards I couldn’t stop reading, and I was on the literal edge of my seat at points, rushing through to see what would happen next.Gideon the Ninth, while gruesome and full of skeletons and death and the ghosts of the past, was also just a beautiful book. It explored the relationships of the living through these ghosts and through death while also just constructing a lyrical and moving story. I couldn’t get enough of it, I still can’t, and I’m honestly debating reading it already.
4805640019	I found this a real chore to read and I partially blame myself. I try to avoid most information about a book before I read, so I will consider this a lesson learned. The basic description of the book spun up my imagination with something a little more exotic, a little more science fiction. But what I got was a YA/NA, mostly-fantasy Hunger Games'ish, haunted gothic manor locked room mystery with a puzzle/key-reward system. Not my favorite genres, but that's my problem. Caveat Emptor.That being said, I enjoyed the author's crackling writing style and the relationship between Gideon and Harrow. There is a spark of interesting potential here, so I reserve the right to begrudgingly read the sequels in the future out of morbid curiosity.
4577649028	II LECTURA : 4.5 ESTRELLAS“-Mucha palabrería. ¿Qué te parece algo así? Una carne, un fin, zorra. Dilo, perdedora.-Una carne...un fin.”Lo sabía. Este libro me ha vuelto a tocar la fibra. Si la primera vez estaba escéptica y me encantó, pero no le puse la quinta estrella porque sentía que me faltaba algo, ahora con esta relectura si se la pongo y a gusto.“La vida es una tragedia. Los que fallecen nos abandonan y no podemos hacer nada al respecto. Es una total ausencia de control…Cuando alguien muere, su espíritu queda libre para siempre, aunque intentemos atraparlo, retenerlo o llamarlos gracias a la especialidad de la Quinta…Pero hasta esa excepción nos demuestra que estamos sometidos a ellos. Solo vienen cuando suplicamos. Cuando alguien fallece, perdemos el control sobre esa persona. ¡Gracias a dios! Solo hay alguien capaz de hacerlo y creo que está muy lejos de aquí. Gideon, no os lamentéis por los muertos. En mi opinión la muerte es el mayor de los triunfos”.Gracias a esta relectura y junto a los conocimientos que tenía del segundo libro he comprendido muchísimo más lo que nos quiere transmitir la autora y el mundo que ha creado, sobre todo leyendo el glosario y anotaciones al final del libro. Ha sido como como encajar las piezas del puzzle que me faltaban de la primera lectura y mi cerebro ha explotado y ha comprendido todo. Ahora, de cara a la relectura del segundo libro siento que esto no puede sino mejorar para mí. Además, le tengo de igual medida miedo y ganas a Nona la novena.“Salvé el mundo en una ocasión…, pero no para mí”.En fin. No quiero hacer una reseña larga porque ya la hice la primera vez y esto no sería sino rizar el rizo. Solo diré un par de cosas:-Amé de nuevo a Gideon y a Harrow a esta primera incluso la comprendí incluso más. -He reído como una estúpida con sus conversaciones al mismo tiempo que he soltado alguna lagrima cuando me dije que no lo haría en el momento justo.-Se ha convertido en uno de mis libros si no favoritos, de los que releería sin lugar a dudas porque tiene un algo que me encanta y me puede.“Nos vemos al otro lado, labios de fresa”.I LECTURA : 4 ESTRELLAS "Rezo para que la tumba permanezca siempre cerrada. Rezo por que la roca nunca se aparte. Rezo por lo que está enterrado permanezca enterrado, inconmovible, en descanso eterno con ojos cerrados y mente extinta. Rezo porque viva. Rezo por que duerma….Este es un libro que en verdad no sabía si tenía ganas de leerlo. Veía muchísimas opiniones diferentes. Al parecer es un libro que amas o un libro que acabas odiando. Bueno, pues aquí se encuentra otra que lo ha amado y no me arrepiento para nada de haberlo leído. Tiene muchos fallos, sí, pero, también contiene bastantes cosas buenas y esta reseña pienso comentarlos todos.En primer lugar, me gustaría comentar la historia y el wordbuilding. Debo admitir que al final del libro existe un glosario donde se nos explica un poco sobre la cronología del imperio y los acontecimientos que han llevado al presente de la historia y los sistemas de magia. Además, una vez que lean esa parte, el resto de la novela se les va a hacer mucho más llevadero. Desgraciadamente, yo me enteré de esto una vez termine el libro, creo que si lo hubiera sabido me hubiera gustado incluso más."-Gideon, estáis bien…Recordadlo y no dejéis que nadie os vuelva a hacer algo así nunca más. Lo siento. Somos tan destructivos…Lo siento mucho".¿El sistema de magia? ¡Nigromancia! Sin embargo, no es la típica magia negra que solo sirve para despertar a los muertos o revivirlos. No, la autora no queda en eso, sino que te muestra las diferentes corrientes que puede tener la nigromancia como pueden ser la adivinación, invocación de almas, reconstrucción ósea, entre otras. Además, me ha gustado mucho que muestre el hecho que no todos los nigromantes son iguales al mismo tiempo que no todos los magos utilizan el mismo tipo de magia ya que algunos obtienen su poder de la tierra, otros del más allá etc.Ahora pasamos a los temas un poco controversiales con esta novela como pueden ser el lenguaje utilizado, la narración y los personajes:Nada más empezar la novela, la autora utiliza un estilo particular de escribir sobre todo en los diálogos. Nos encontramos con una protagonista mal hablada, impertinente incluso soez que lo único que parece es soltar insultos, algunos bastante fuertes hacia el resto de los personajes. Este registro familiar-vulgar puede parecerles a muchos de nosotros una bandera roja y querer abandonarlo ipso facto. Sin embargo, yo no lo he visto así y pienso que la autora lo ha hecho a propósito para romper con los esquemas literarios - narrativos establecidos desde siempre en la literatura. Me explico, siempre ha habido una diferencia entre el lenguaje escrito versus el oral. Es decir, no hablamos de la misma manera que escribimos. Cuando leemos una novela los personajes siempre hablan “bien” y son correctos la mayor parte del tiempo. ¿Qué es lo que ha hecho entonces la autora? Ha jugado con ello. Nos ha mostrado de verdad como hablaría una persona en una situación “real” y así es Gideon.“¿Cómo que por qué? Pues porque te odio con toda mi alma, porque eres una puta bruja del averno. Sin ofender”.¿Los personajes? Aquí sí que me gustaría hacer una muralla entre los secundarios y las protagonistas. Por un lado, sí que admito que los personajes secundarios son en su mayoría clichés y les falta profundidad así algunos se comportaban como inmaduros, pero eso no es su punto fuerte, la autora nos muestra de verdad como se comporta la gente, sobre todo debido a edades determinadas."-Estoy muy acostumbrada a que todos los que me rodean hablen de lo mal que se me da todo lo que hago, pero también tengo sentimientos, ¿sabéis?"Ahora bien, las protagonistas: Gideon y Harrow. Me han encantado. Desde el primer momento puedes darte cuenta del odio que se tienen la una a la otra y la autora lo llega a transmitir de tal manera que lo sientes en tus entrañas. Cada página que leías se palpaba aún más el odio y eso es algo impresionante. Además, aunque no lo parezca en un primer momento se tratan de dos personajes bastante reales y complejos, sobre todo Harrow y he llegado a entenderlas a ambas. Son personajes rotos, eso es lo que son.“-Donde tu murieses, moriré yo, y allí seré sepultada. Tal es la voluntad del Señor para conmigo, y así sea, porque la muerte será lo único que nos separe”.Por último, pero no con ello menos importante es para mí la atmosfera o ambientación que caracteriza esta novela. Yo admito que cuando leo y me sumerjo en el mundo creado por los autores veo por así decirlo “colores”. Estos se reflejan tanto en el escenario, los personajes como en los sistemas de magia. Esta novela está llena de colores purpuras, grises, blancos, negros y azul marino o escarlatas. Unido a todo esto tenemos una novela de tintes muy oscuros que se complementa con las emociones, carácter y poderes de los personajes.En conclusión. Una novela que es mucho más profunda de lo que parece a simple vista debido a sus clichés y sus fallos pero que merece la pena al menos darle una oportunidad."UN CARNE, UN FIN."PD: OVERHAUL HE GANADO.
2953740266	UPDATE 23/09/2022: Reread in preparation to read Nona the Ninth.“One flesh, one end, bitch.” I stand by every word of my original review. Simply brilliant!ORIGINAL REVIEWSuperb!I absolutely loved this book. I didn't have much idea of what was going on in terms of the magic system and the world building but apparently that didn't affect my enjoyment levels. At all. I'm not sure what that says about me, but I suspect it is more a reflection of the fact that this author has hands down created the best main character ever in our potty-mouthed and caustic, Gideon. I have to say the humour in the book was so brilliant and I totally loved it. I would tentatively add that many Kiwis will 'get' this type of comedy and I think, thanks to the likes of Flight of the Conchords, Taika Waititi and Rhys Darby, our special brand of Kiwi comedy is well known and loved abroad too. Seriously, some parts of the novel should be used as lyrics by Flight of the Conchords.The humour in the book is at times a dry kind of humour, “And in some far-off way Gideon had always known that this would be how she went: gangbanged to death by skeletons.”and at times based on comedic imagery, “Ortus wasn’t made in his mould. Coupling him to Harrow had been rather like yoking a doughnut to a cobra.”and at times a bit dark,“The ashes in the incinerator had been raked out and combed over, and the confirmation that they were human remains was not illuminating. The surviving necromancers had gathered around a bowl of them, and they had all pounced on it like a bowl of peanuts at a party.”and at times a little bit grubby. “Don’t hypothetically shove stuff up my butt again,” said Gideon, “it never does any good.”“He was narrow shouldered with long, long arms, and she was beginning to believe that he was not simply a douchebag who used lip balm, but a douchebag who used lip balm and had a very long reach.”But it is always clever. I absolutely recommend this book for it's comedic value and for the incredible science fantasy world that Tamsyn Muir has created, for which I would really like someone to create a Wiki Fandom thingy so I can have an outside chance of understanding all it's intricacies.It's now one of my favourite books and I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
3900171508	A ver, quizás debería ser más un 3,5 porque la parte central se me hizo un poco bola (ya sabemos que el misterio y yo no nos llevamos bien) pero es que todo lo demás me ha gustado DEMASIADO. Y pues eso, que aquí se puntúa con el corazón. Gideon la Novena es uno de esos libros que o te encantan o los odias, no hay término medio, todo es excesivo y caótico en él. La historia sigue a Gideon, espadachina y soldado de la Novena Casa, que termina haciendo de guardaespaldas y caballera de su enemiga mortal: la nigromante y heredera Harrow. Juntas deberán enfrentarse a un montón de problemas, asesinatos varios y misterios en medio de una extraña competición con todas las Casas por convertirse en la mano derecha del Emperador.Es una novela que te atrapa desde el primer momento por la originalidad de su ambientación y por sus personajes, en las que no dejan de acontecer todo tipo de cosas que no te da tiempo a asimilar y en la que reina un maravilloso caos permanente.A mi me ha parecido original, divertida, irreverente, sangrienta y al final muy épica, pero especialmente me he enamorado de sus dos protagonistas, Gideon y Harrow. Y por eso creo que la he disfrutado tanto, porque este libro no es tanto de trama (la trama es lo más flojo de hecho, recuerda a 'Diez negritos' y no te da tiempo a saber quién es quién antes de que se te muera la gente), sino de personajes y ambientación. Y ese mundo que crea la autora, que recuerda a otros muchos pero que logra convertir en algo completamente único y personal es lo que hace que me haya parecido una historia tan especial. He disfrutado con cada pequeño dato de ese universo que la autora nos iba soltando y espero que nos cuente mucho más en las siguientes novelas de la saga.Porque sí, este es el primer libro de una saga y no sabéis con las ganas que me quedo de seguir con ella...Finalmente me gustaría destacar la traducción de David Tejera porque tremendo lío tuvo que ser meterse en la cabeza de Gideon y traducir eso en nuestro idioma xDPd. Siempre con la Sexta casa. Siempre.
2994913836	Both previous reviews still stand!This book has some glaring issues, but I don’t care. In the way it succeeds, it really succeeds. And I love all of it so much, flaws and all. ——————After letting this story marinate in my brain for a few weeks, I'm changing my rating from 3.5 to 5 stars.Y'all are probably like, um.... bitch... that's a jump.I know. I'm sorta confused, too.BUT, despite the book's faults, this story has stayed on my mind, tugging on my 3 brain cells so hard that I've started rereading via audiobook. Something about Gideon the Ninth has captured my interest and has refused to let go, has embedded itself in my memories and likes to constantly remind me that its there. The reading experience is even better the second time around, btw.This is one of my favorite books of the year. Yes, the world-building is weak and practically non-existent. Yes, it can be tiresomely confusing at times. Yes, I wish there was more romance.Yet, there's still a lot about this story to love. The humor, the characters, the plot, the writing style. It's all so great that it cancels out the weaknesses. But, most of all, I just had a really good time reading this book. Isn't that all that matters? Five weird, random, confusing stars! --------- *3.5 “Death first to vultures and scavengers.” Hello to one of the most unique books I've ever read!I'm not going to try to give a synopsis of Gideon the Ninth in this review because I truly cannot figure out how to sum up this book in a couple of sentences. This book takes a lot of common tropes of fantasy and sci-fi--impending doom, competition for glory, a murder mystery--and smacks it upside to show it who's boss. This book is violent, hilarious, death-filled, and unlike anything else in the genre.Overall, I did really enjoy this. I love Tamsyn Muir's writing style. She's hilarious! This book is wickedly funny and so much of the dry humor reminded me of jokes I would have made if in the same situations. I love how dark this world is and how dark Muir's mind is. She did an incredible job of developing all of the characters as well. She's definitely an author I'm going to read from in the future, regardless of the content she writes.The characters are fantastic. I ended up adoring all of them by the end. They all have their own personalities, motivations, and inner depths that you don't always find in books with bigger ensembles. Some of them are funny, some of them are smart, some of them are evil, some of them are just plain creepy. The way they all interact with each other pops off the page. I genuinely enjoyed all of them so much! There's reasons why I'm sad about some of them, but we won't go into detail here.I read this novel physically, with the audiobook to supplement it as I read. I highly, highly recommend reading the book physically alongside the audiobook. The narrator is probably the best performer I've ever heard. Her normal speaking voice is beautiful, but she has incredible voices for each character, which fitted each of them perfectly! I actually ended up developing crushes on some characters I wouldn't have otherwise because she made them come alive (and also sound incredibly hot for no reason). I wouldn't, however, recommend reading this book just on audio. You would get lost so quickly. This is a book you need physically so you can refer to the dramatis personae (thank god there is one) and just be able to check back on past pages to make sure you've got everything right.So, yes. This book is good. It's funny and dark and unique and does things I've seen before but in a way I have never seen before. It's good! But also, it has issues.My first issue with Gideon the Ninth is that it's very confusing. This is partially because of how Tamsyn Muir writes dialogue, and partially because this universe and its lore is quite massive and complex. The plot itself is also quite complex. I would find myself feeling lost or that I wasn't truly understanding the magnitude of some moments. The world is not fully developed by any means. There are nine houses, all with their own functions, but we weren’t ever specifically told what each were. This universe is huge yet we were confined to one setting, where all the characters know their world and didn’t need to teach it to anybody. So, the world was never explicitly explained - you only learned through small hints in the dialogue or Gideon’s narrative. This was frustrating and I almost DNF-ed the book a little before halfway because of it. It doesn't ever really get better, necessarily, but I was more mindful to pay close attention and I ended up sorta getting everything. Some parts are still murky, though, even after finishing.Another issue I had was with Gideon herself. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed her character, but I found her to be very passive in her own story. She didn't actually do anything most of the time. Her main talent was sword fighting, but she only did it once very briefly at the beginning of the book and then briefly at the end. We were told over and over that that was her gift, yet we never really got to see it. Since fighting was the only thing she was really good at, Gideon didn't do much else. She tagged along and provided funny, sarcastic commentary. That was about it. By the end of the book, though, I understood why. It's actually a bit brilliant. It was purposeful. But while I was reading I found it irritating.Now... let's talk about how much this book has been sold as "lesbian necromancers in space". 2.5/3 of that is correct. Yes, Gideon is a lesbian. Other female characters are currently ambiguous. However, there is little to no romance in this book. When there is romance, it's very diluted and you don't even realize it's happening because it's so subtle. Gideon has never experienced romance before, so much of her interactions with women are awkward, innocent, and very much remind of pre-teen flirtation. It's not a bad thing by any means, it was actually really cute, but I wanted more! All we got was a few potentially romantic interactions (I'm still not sure) and Gideon's inner dialogue of appreciating women. It was okay, but not what I was hoping for.To sum it up, this book is good. If you prefer action over romance, or mystery over quest, this book will work well for you. It's so freakin' dark and unique. I mean, the main characters paint their faces to look like skeletons. How is that not the most badass thing you've ever heard?I'm definitely reading the sequel (did y'all see that cover?!)! I love Tamsyn Muir's writing, even if it is a bit confusing at times. Gideon the Ninth is not a perfect book, but overall I recommend it. This is an ambitious world and I'm very interested to see where it goes next.
3531497997	That was fun, bit not as much as I expected. I love the sci-fi and necromancers, so I thought that the combination of both would be brilliant. But the first book lacks world-building and I felt bit disappointed. It reminded me of Frank Herbert's Duna: the emperor and the magical science (or scientific magic). I liked the dark humour (though I wanted more of such stuff) and author's ruthlessness in getting rid of the most likeable characters. The book definitely deserves all the praise, but I thought I would love it more than I did.
3306276503	This was a wonderfully surprising, gonzo, strange, funny, and very absorbing novel, and is one of the most out-and-out enjoyable reads I’ve had in quite some time. I had been wary of diving into this book over the past couple of years; more than once, I’ve bounced hard off of other popular, super-hyped contemporary SFF literature I’ve read. But Tamsyn Muir writes with bucketloads of confidence, verve, wit, imagination, and even a welcome dash of heart, and from page one, she had me eagerly devouring chapter after chapter, along for every twisty inch of her wild, fascinating, goofy, and disturbing ride. What keeps my rating from reaching 5 stars for me — it is truly *thisclose* — is that not all of Muir’s emotional beats resonate quite as much as I think they could have if there was just a bit more care taken in earning them. But over all, the fact that Muir can walk a line of convincingly rendering many genuinely comical scenes, and then swiftly and effortlessly pivoting into darker moments that feel truly harrowing, is quite impressive. I’m sorry I took so long to join the hype train, only because I’ve missed out on earlier enjoyment, and I am looking forward to continuing this series.
3634150926	mi è esplosa una bomba in testa ma sto bene, anzi benissimo!DATEMI HARROW.
3025876793	I think this one holds a lot of promise. The wordbuilding, alone, is enough to leave me giddy. It's not super deep, mind you, other than the interesting features of the Houses and the fact that this seems like some sort of epic fantasy by way of hard SF so far in the future that there's no real difference, but it's these very elements that capture my imagination the most.Gideon, herself, is often kinda annoying. Her Necromancer tormenter/friend is even more annoying. Mind you, their kind of annoying is very much in line with a lot of modern YA but I may be getting tired of the over-the-top torture sessions. And when I mean torture, I mean sheer brutality and nastiness in spirit. These two only start really getting along after they realize the REST of the houses are worse in the bats**t insanity.Is it a feature of being necromancers? Maybe? Maybe not? Either way, it's tolerable and sometimes even edifying when they sort that crap out. The one thing I have absolutely no complaint about is the bones. No bones to pick with the bones. Or the battles. The puzzles. The reveals. I loved all of them. I'm a big fan of all the necromancy in general and the fact that they have it all with spaceships too is a real treat. I'm definitely continuing with this. A little good interpersonal resolution has gone a long way for me. :)
2954749719	I have very little understanding of what happened in this book but I fuckin love Gideon and Harrow
2841278988	Gideon the Ninth is a spectacular mess of a book. It fails as often as it works, and with the same degree of commitment from its author. In her debut, Tamsyn Muir displays enough imagination for any three writers and only a passing acquaintance with storytelling discipline. The resulting novel is a lot like one of the giant, beastly skeletal constructs that we encounter in its pages, smashing through walls and floors like some uncontrollable literary golem that’s broken its restraints. There is no middle ground here, gang. Readers are either gushing helplessly over this book, or they’ve DNF’d it within the first hundred pages. If Tamsyn Muir had pulled it off flawlessly, it might have been a more digestible read, but something tells me it wouldn’t have been nearly as interesting to talk about.Gideon Nav has grown up in the sepulchral holdings of the Ninth House, located deep within a crevasse on a world belonging to an empire whose ruler is an immortal deity. Gideon is a foundling, her origins shrouded in mystery, and she’s lived in indentured servitude to the House, where she’s nurtured a lifelong and mutual hatred between herself and its heir, young Harrowhark Nonagesimus. One of the stranger aspects of Muir’s world building is that we never seem to see many people in this presumably galactic empire. The Ninth House practices necromancy, because that’s just a cool gothy thing to do, and so there are hordes of animated skeletons to do all the menial work.Gideon has planned her escape from the Ninth, where she hopes to use her considerable sword fighting skills in the Cohort, the imperial military. But her freedom is thwarted by Harrow, who compels Gideon to serve as her cavalier — a kind of personal champion and aide-de-camp — on a mission of utmost importance, Harrow says, to the continued survival of the Ninth House. (continued...)
3015857634	August 2022: This was still one of the best things I've ever read. I laughed out loud. The audio is great. Two thumb bones up.January 2021: Please note that although there are no real (untagged) spoilers in this review, intuitive readers/reviewers might be spoiled anyway because of the way I'm going to say some things. You have been vaguely warned!"Read Gideon the Ninth!" they said. "You'll love it!" they said. Well, fuck you, I did! I did love it! And I'm so mad and so sad also! It's been a long time since I let a book get to me like this, and frankly, I blame everyone. I blame the author for creating such a lovable main character (and lovable side characters). I blame the author for what she did with the plot and the character progression; she knows what she did and so do all the rest of you! I blame every single fucking person who told me to read this g.d. book. As Gideon would say, "if my heart had a dick you would kick it."Look, nobody warned me that I was signing up for emotional wrenching here. And I read a lot of reviews of this book before I actually read the book itself! Y'all would not shut your mouths about it! So, I'm just doing everyone who hasn't already read it a public service here: If you decide to read this book you will be having such a great time with it; you will experience true joy, and then after that you will have your heart ripped up and out through your esophagus, and you will bleed out your feelings all over the floor. That is what you are signing up for. Yes, there will also be vulgar hilarity and quippage, and lovingly crafted, profane verbiage uttered by lovable garbage humans. And that is how the book tricks you.Also, I heard so much about how you had to give the book time, and the worldbuilding was confusing, wah wah etc. But I had zero problems. And in fact, I was in after two pages, and in love after four, when a minor character complains about Gideon offering him "sick pornographies" in exchange for letting her escape (she did offer him a "stupendous work of a titty nature," her words). I think if you're worrying about the worldbuilding here, you're never gonna gel with this book. This book is like a hodge-podge of everything the author loves in stories, up to and including queerness, gothicness, necromancy, skeletons, mysteries, magic, mysterious death, space, friendships, romance, attractive people being badass in sword fights, swearing, murder, galactic empires, red herrings, siblings, loyalty, puzzles, sunglasses, the color black. Should I go on? Honestly, the central through lines in this book have almost nothing to do with the world, but with the characters and their relationships, and with the mystery of what's going on in the haunted mansion in space. As long as you are grasping the basics of the worldbuilding, you're fine. The rest unfolds itself in time, and I'm sure will continue to do so throughout the remaining two books.Which I will not be reading any time soon because I'm still not over this one. I haven't fallen in love with a character this much in a very, very long time. There's just something so lovable about Gideon, who at the same time she is being feisty and talented and intimidatingly badass, is also so loyal and open to being vulnerable with people, and is so capable of love. Meanwhile she's off swearing and being pleased when people are complimenting the size of her biceps, and feeling gooey over married people, and feeling affection for terrible teenagers. She is a golden retriever person dressed up like a ninja with an affinity for skulls. I love her so much. (view spoiler)[What happened at the end of this book broke me. I'm so sad about it I don't want to pick up the next book. I couldn't concentrate on any other book for a week or more after finishing. I can't decide if I love or hate what happened. Probably both. And neither. That Gideon sacrificed herself like that tops off her character arc beautifully. But now we have to live in a world where she doesn't exist. And honestly, fuck that (hide spoiler)].For this review, I also decided to do a tiny experiment. Part of what I loved so much about Gideon the Ninth was the narrative style, which was incredibly unique and very much to my level. The way Tamsyn Muir has with words just tickles me. So I opened the book five times at random (in chronological order) and read until I found a quote that popped out. My theory was that I could do this for pretty much any page and find something that stood out. This turned out to be true five out of five times. I would advise not reading this section if you would like to be surprised over anything in this book, including its tone and verbiage."So, here's the thing, your Lady would set the Locked Tomb on fire if it meant I'd never see another sky," Gideon said, looking up. "Your Lady would stone cold eat a baby if it meant she got to lock me up infinitely. Your Lady would slather burning turds on the great-aunts if she thought it would ruin my day."I remember laughing out loud delightedly when I read Gideon's first insults about Harrow.There were four pairs of hungry eyes watching that fight, but they all blurred into the background of a dream: the lines one's brain filled in to abbreviate a place, a time, a memory. Gideon Nav knew in the first half second that Magnus was going to lose: after that she stopped thinking with her brain and started thinking with her arms, which were frankly where the best of her cerebral matter lay.Gideon is a little vain about her appearance, and isn't the smartest person in the room, but she knows what she's good at, and I love that about her."Don't have an aneurysm, Nav. I cannot and will not read your thoughts, control your body, or look at your most intimate memories. I don't have the ability and I certainly don't have the desire.""It's for your protection, not mine," said Gideon. "I imagined Crux's butt once when I was twelve." For if you have a twelve year old's sense of humor.Minor spoilers in this one, sort of:"Gideon? . . . Gideon!"When she opened her eyes again there was a dazzling moment of clarity and sharpness. Harrow Nonagesimus was kneeling by her side, naked as the day she was spawned. Her hair was shorn a full inch shorter, the tips of her eyelashes were gone, and--most horrifyingly--she was absolutely nude of face paint. It was as though someone had taken a hot washcloth to her. Without paint she was a point-chinned, narrow-jawed, ferrety person, with high hard cheekbones and a tall forehead. There was a little divot in her top lip at the philtrum, which gave a bowlike aspect to her otherwise hard and fearless mouth. The world rocked, but it was mainly because Harrow was shaking her shoulders."Ha-ha," said Gideon, "first time you didn't call me Griddle," and died. There is SO MUCH GOING ON HERE. It's funny and scary and sad and tragic and tense all at the same time!"Have you ever seen a necromancer hold a sword before?" she asked gaily."No," said Gideon, "I thought their arms would all flop around!" <3Gideon, facedown on the dusty ground, moaned, "I want to die."She was nudged with a foot, not unkindly, "Get up, Griddle.""Why was I born so attractive?""Because everyone would have throttled you within the first five minutes otherwise," said her necromancer.The best part about this exchange is that it makes you remember she's only still a young person, embarrassed about liking someone, and stepping on a friend's toes about it. The histrionics here are devastatingly accurate, in my experience.In summation, I loved this book and I'm sad I read it and I'm happy I read it but also I can't go on. If you too would like to experience a confluence of emotions and genre, read this book!But also:["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
6592534756	4.0 StarsThis is a character driven sci fantasy story that manages to be both dark and cozy at the same time. The story is quirky with a touch of humor. I understand why this novel is hit or miss with readers but I'm glad it worked for me.
4973729747	5 necro starsA Clue-style mystery setting mashed with scintillating razor-sharp humor mashed with intricate puzzle-box plotting mashed with post-apocalyptic necromancy mashed with intergalactic space vibes mashed with death/not-death mashed with lesbian drama mashed with—I could go on, but we’d be here all day. This is an excellent chaotic casserole of brilliant nonsense.Originality: ★★★★★Plot/Pacing: ★★★★★Characters: ★★★★Writing: ★★★★★ UPDATE 7/15/23: Reread it, loved it the same, had even more good times as the eggs are all buried in this waiting for us to see them for what they are. I now completely understand why Gideon the Ninth is marketed the way it is. Let me explain. This book came out in 2019. It was pitched as "lesbian necromancers in space." I, not particularly liking space and not receiving much else from that limited pitch, took a pass on reading it. "Lesbian necromancers" was interesting... but vague. I didn't have enough to go on to outweigh my dislike of Star Wars-esque space-y stuff involving politics and planets. Then the reviews started coming out and all of them said a confusing blend of nonsensical ?!?!?!, fandom love for the queer epic-ness, mentions of how messed up and dark and brutal it was, and a general sense of awe and an utter unwillingness to describe what was going on. I was more intrigued, but not quite enough to pick it up. I had a lot to read, and this was still in my no-no zone of adult hard science fiction (I believed it to be, anyway.)I waited until 2022 to read it.Hot diggity dang, what a book. One of those Amy-you-dumbass, shoulda coulda woulda read it earlier type of moments. Gideon the Ninth is an epic done on the intimate and bonkers foundations of the post-modern cultural moment of the now as opposed to the traditional scale of genre and expectations. Its readership both fits the pitch "lesbian necromancers in space" and yet needs to include other groups of people—myself included—who should ignore that pitch and try this glorious black hole of a book anyway.I, too, will remain weirdly vague and wax rhapsodic on its attributes over its actual plot because going into this book blind, like a horror-thriller, is really the way to go. It's a murder mystery. It's a haunted house novel. It's a video game-esque questing story with challenges to defeat. It's puzzles to solve. It's hidden clues on the tale ends of sentences and descriptions leading the reader unknowingly to the inevitable. It's a plot-twist thriller. It's an intimate enemies-to-[something?] with a passionate rivalry/hatred to rouse the interests of the most hardened of the slow burn smut readers—an unbelievable feat considering there is no pay-off in this particular installment. It's a gut punch, a brutal overthrow of your expectations. It's also pop-culture level funny with quips that seriously date it and yet add to the humor and surprise.I'm honestly shocked at how not-science fiction this novel feels while remaining such a strong science fiction novel. This is a gothic ballad to the queer emo mixed with the sardonic humor of the Black Death aficionados. I have spent this review making sentences with lofty nonsense pairings for the vibes and to depict the emotional aura of this novel because, frankly, I think Tamsyn would approve. (If my review annoys you, pass on this book.)Blog | Instagram | Libro.fm Audiobooks
4852886852	A disappointing let down. I had high hopes for this but alas...it wasn't just something I found enjoyable.The humour was 'snarky' and nice, but lackluster world-building riddled with inconsistencies and a meagre plotline was a serious turn off.I might or might not give the sequel a try, but I wasn't impressed with this at all. I really wanted to like it more but it fell totally flat (with shards of osseous tissue sprawled everywhere!).
3939589802	New goal: become a punk-ish girlboss necromancer wielding questionably timed humour and mediocre face painting skills ✅Captivating, cutthroat, and deeply atmospheric, Gideon the Ninth proved to be a ferociously entertaining read. A galactic empire founded on the principles of necromancy sounded like nothing I’ve read before, and oh hell was it something special! “You couldn’t spell obligation if I shoved the letters up your ass.” “I gotta say, I don’t think that would help,” said Gideon. “God, I’m glad you didn’t teach me my spelling.” ~★~ What is this book about? ~★~ The undying emperor is searching for powerful necromancers to become his Lyctors. He addresses the Nine Houses of necromancy, calling for a competition of merits between the heirs and cavaliers of each House. Those who prove their worth will be granted immortality, an unimaginable prize that some would go to extreme lengths for.Gideon Nav is—in every sense but literally—chained to the Ninth House. She’s been trying to make her great escape for years with no luck. A chance at freedom presents itself, however, when Harrowhark (the necromantic heir to the Ninth House, and Gideon’s nemesis since childhood) asks her to stand in as cavalier for the competition. Their original plans come to a screeching halt as they arrive at the First House, when the competitors find themselves at the centre of a series of fresh murders haunting the place. ~★~ Characters ~★~ First and foremost: Gideon Nav was a complete riot. Her vibrant persona bled off the pages through witty dialogue, heartwarming friendships and tense rivalries. Even when she and the other competitors faced potential death, humour was utilized as a coping mechanism, which reinforced a sense of humanity within a story otherwise heavily fantastical. “Gideon winked at her increasingly agitated companion. She said, sotto voce: “But then you couldn’t have admired … these,” and whipped on the glasses she’d unearthed back home. They were ancient smoked-glass sunglasses, with thin black frames and big mirrored lenses, and they greyed out Harrow’s expression of incredulous horror as she adjusted them on her nose.” It’s admirable, how distinctive and dynamic Muir was able to make her main cast. From Houses Two to Nine, there are eighteen prevalent necromancers and cavaliers to follow. It wasn’t until tragedy struck that I realized just how much I cared for some of them (view spoiler)[I loved Protesilaus more than most, probably. I always adore the silent brutes, sue me. (hide spoiler)]; by the end I felt strongly for each character (whether out of love or hate). I was most hesitant about Harrow for the majority of this installment, (probably because Gideon disliked her for so long) but after hearing her backstory I’m left eager to follow her perspective in book two. ~★~ Writing ~★~ I won’t lie Gideon the Ninth gets off to a pretty shaky start. The dense and oddly confusing phrasing littered though first few pages made me question if I’d be able to get through this book at all. Luckily, Muir’s style quickly loosens up as character dialogue becomes more frequent, and the story continues to flow beautifully from there.It’s funny that I disliked Muir’s writing at first, because eventually I couldn’t stop marvelling at it. It’s rare that I come across an author is so skilled in descriptiveness that nearly nothing is left to the imagination, but I had almost zero trouble envisioning this incredibly well structured world. Muir’s vocabulary is certainly tremendous. ~★~ Worldbuilding, Magic & Plot ~★~ Reiterating what I said above, Muir’s writing elevates every aspect of this story, especially the magic system and world. The atmosphere was, let me emphasize, completely mind-boggling. I mean, seriously good shit. I could picture every room of the First House in all their gothic glory; the sense of necromantic power and dark otherness prevalent was heavy in the best way. It was fascinating to learn of each House’s specialty (soul siphoning, classic necromancy, etc) “Her adept said: "I'll keep it off you. Nav, show them what the Ninth House does."Gideon lifted her sword. The construct worked itself free of its last confines of masonry and rotten wood and heaved before them, flexing itself like a butterfly."We do bones, motherfucker," she said.” The high stakes murder mystery had me consistently interested in the story’s proceedings. I had several pressing theories (none of which were correct, as usual); it was great fun to convince myself I was close to uncovering the truth, when in reality I was worlds away from it. Muir, you devil, how dare you do what you did! When folks say the second half is far superior to the first, boy do they mean it.——— {⚔️💀⚔️} ——— Gideon the Ninth was an all around entertaining read, featuring its fair share of horror and thrills. I do wish the romance was a little more prominent, though I can appreciate the moments we did get between between Gideon and a certain someone. If you’re a a fan of science-fiction, necromancy, or light horror (and are looking for some lesbian representation), look no further, this is the perfect book for you! “One flesh, one end, bitch.”
2975762045	Oops. Read it again. Loved it again. This time way more love for Pal and Cam than last time. What a dumpling he is. Whoa. What a wacky ride this was! If you're fond of the pulpiness of the movie "Clue" and computer or tabletop RPGs, you might really have a lot of fun with this book. In fact, I really, really want the computer game version of this world. It's got everything set up, somebody buy the rights!CONTENT WARNING: (just a list of topics) (view spoiler)[ genocide, infanticide, body horror, torture, loss of parents, suicide, chronic terminal illness/cancer (hide spoiler)]Things that were such fun:-The magic. I want to know more! There are 9 different kinds of necromancy, but we don't see a lot of what's different about it. I love the concept though!!-The conversation. I really loved all the tiny script, the sotto voce comments, the banter, the monologues etc. It's HIGHLY stylized, but I could picture Tim Curry dashing around grabbing people, mimicking them and so on. This book feels like one of the instant cult classics.-The vocabulary. Hilariously over the top in all directions. There are words I haven't seen since SAT prep, the f bomb getting dropped everywhere and phrases like "the bad teen was talking," which is so uncommunicative it rolls back around into hilarity.-The setting. I looooved the different worlds, the decrepit dungeon castle setting, and the mythology being woven.-The characters. They may not have been the deepest out there, but they all had their own strengths and weaknesses, voices and pressure points. I liked that we got to see that. Given the cast, that's pretty impressive.Things that weren't perfect:-It was very obvious. The foreshadowing, the video-game pacing, the dinner party mystery, you'll see most of it coming a mile away.-Wrong focus. Gideon's not really the main character, despite spending all our time in her head.-Frenemies. It got a bit much. It worked for me, but it was a lot.-Anachronisms. Let's grant for the moment that in something like 12,000 years, modern day English becomes cool again and people "nope" out of things etc. I still don't understand how Gideon, who was surprised by paper, and only knew something was wood because she'd seen a picture of wood before, would know what an oak was. There were things like that throughout that showed that world building was not as important as finding more pockets for the word "fuck" to get tucked into.Let's make no bones about it. This isn't a good book. It's a pulpy, bloody, campy thing, and frankly? I'm dead. It was humerus, and if the puns don't get your nose out of joint, you knee-d to read it.
3895088532	Hale, dos estrellas y va que arde. 78%, (431 pags) y creo que ya le he dado bastante triguillo. Esta vez me toca ir de nota discordante.Me aburre, no me interesa ni historia ni personajes ni supuesta trama de asesinatos. El “misterio” de la Tumba Sellada, menos aún (ya sé lo que hay dentro).Prometía mucho en su comienzo, pero no me gusta como desarrolla NADA. Y eso de meter palabros nigrománticos o “tanato-lo-que-sea” tenía su gracia si no abusase de ello.Y si nos metes nueve “casas”, pues cuéntanos algo de ellas, anda, por favor. Que se supone que las definen sus comportamientos (supongo), pero ni por esas. ¿Y cada casa aviene de un planeta? ¿Y hay naves aparte de esas “lanzaderas”? Pues igual lo cuenta luego, pero me he aburrido.La relación nigromante/caballera tampoco me convence (ni me motiva). En general toda la trama me parece infantiloide. Enrevesada, pero sin cuerpo.Va, que no sigo. Lo anterior es solo para explicarme cuando siga viendo el notón que tiene la novela (¿y tal vez sus siguientes partes?) el por qué yo no pude con ella.
4845355645	The reviews of this book seem polarizing and unfortunately I fall on the negative side. I think one could generally describe the plot as lesbian necromancers take on dark foes, featuring eerie politics and lots of sword fighting. Despite how exciting this premise may sound, I found the writing pretty flat and repetitive. Gideon didn’t come across as a dynamic character to me – while she’s energetic and agentic, I don’t think her internal world was described with much depth or nuance. Her dynamic with Harrow, the other main character, felt predictable to me. Finally, I struggled to grasp or care about the worldbuilding, and Tamsyn Muir introduces a ton of characters throughout the book that pop in and out in ways that didn’t leave much of an impression to me. We’ll see how my next read goes!
2986596251	A quanto pare è possibile dare 4 stelle al libro dell'anno.È possibile perché santissima Tamsyn Muir, sei una pazza, ti amo, voglio leggere tutto quello che scrivi, ma capire di tanto in tanto cosa cazzo sta succedendo potrebbe essere un'idea.Così.La butto lì

3549386384	Reading Vlog/Review: https://youtu.be/vbYonFpFDi8What the actual fuck was happening in this book? I have not a clue.There's confusing and then there's this head trip. I want to point out that there are parts of this book that are phenomenal. Gideon's banter. Harrow's stubborness and begrudging respect. Their enemies to lovers? whatever they are. I loved all of that. It's sharp and weird in a lot of amazing ways. But it wasn't cohesive or coherent. Like good lord.I read the first 150 pages of this book TWICE and still had to wiki the summary of the book before continuing. To give reference to what I was reading. That's right. I had to spoil myself on every aspect of the book just to understand what was happening in the book.I am not alone in this. I've watched many people's reviews on youtube and read reviews on goodreads. So many people feel the same. The question, are you willing to slog through this much confusion to get to the great bits? I thought I could but no.I really hope Tamsyn Muir starts writing a different series soon because I would gladly pick up something new from her in the future when she is a bit more established.Unfortunately, while this hit the mark in very specific and tiny ways, it completely missed on the whole. Glad I read it though.
3022516574	oh my FUCKING god
2846162262	Second reading in audiobook: my general impressions of this book haven't changed much, or at all. It's wobbly in places. We're called on to try to sort out a mystery without having enough connection with the many supporting characters to care very much about how they're affected by it. (Some--not all--of them caused pangs of sympathy in hindsight.) The endgame of Gideon and Harrow's interpersonal arc felt rushed and I think we could have spent a bit more time on the intermediate stages of that rather than the videogame-like challenges. I'm getting finicky about something I liked a lot!I caught a few details along the way that I'd glossed over on my first reading, and I think I'm in decent shape to listen to Harrow the Ninth and not feel dragged down and confused, as long as I get to it fairly soon. It's tempting to nudge this first volume down to three stars because of its sloggy patches, but I won't because of its prickly, vulnerable and (eventually) lovable leads. First review after reading the ebook is below.***After reading a few friends' reviews, I didn't have high hopes for this book. The star ratings literally went the whole gamut from one to five, which can often lead to a decent read with a lot of caveats. Still, I was curious about why it was so divisive, so I gave it a try when it was on sale in ebook. As you can see, I ended up liking it a lot!I wouldn't call this hard SF, and at the beginning I thought there wasn't much reason to call it SF at all. These folks could have been on one planet, with the various necromancer Houses being in different cities, and the story would be about the same, as far as I could tell. When weird science was brought to light in the middle of the book, it felt much more like SF, albeit not of the "hard science and/or space opera" variety. It's more like science fantasy, which is fine, by the way! The scope of almost everything that happens is limited to Canaan House on the First's world--it's small-scale, even intimate, and that ended up being much of its appeal for me.Ignoring the rather dreary question of how to categorize this book, what's it like? It's fun! Gideon is a great character to hang out in the head of. She's ignorant about the workings of necromancy, and largely uncaring, so the reader doesn't get long treatises about each House's magic that aren't interrupted by Gideon impatiently telling the long-winded explainer to shut up and get to the point, already. The language is an odd, distinctive mix of highfalutin diction/vocabulary and brassy cussing. Maybe Gideon's extremely contemporary meme-speak will age about as well as a dead fish on a summer sidewalk, but she made me chuckle a lot more than the quotes in friends' reviews would have led me to believe.The characters aside from Gideon and her necromancer Harrowhark were hard to tell apart at first, but as things went along, the necromancers and cavaliers from the other seven Houses distinguished themselves in an organic way. This was true of the relationships between them, as well. And also true of the necromantic magic unique to each house. Things are sketched in to the degree they're needed to move the story forward, and sometimes they're explained more fully later, and sometimes not. I liked that.One thing I hadn't expected was how much Gideon's story affected me emotionally. Coming into this, I thought she'd be a boring badass with a big attitude, nothing to feel any sympathy for, or connection with. But Gideon's actually very vulnerable, and longs for the things that most people long for: companionship, love, something like a family. My heart went out to this lonely kid, and I was saddened when the bodies started piling up during the "And Then There Were None" part of the book, and the bonds that Gideon had made with her peers were broken in a very final way.There are a few shortcomings, sure, especially in its latter fourth or so. After a locked-room mystery with some cool necromancy and character revelations, there's a long speech by the "last boss" explaining all their plans, and a big battle (ho-hum), and an ending that somewhat undid its own lead-up, not to spoil too much. While it was fitting, and there were definitely signposts for it as the story went along, there was something unsatisfactory about it. Maybe the deliberate open ends that might not be dealt with until the last book? The relationship between Harrow and Gideon is freighted with a lot of baggage and pain, and I wasn't convinced when (view spoiler)[one conversation immediately changed them from enemies to loyal companions (hide spoiler)]. Much of the middle and end of the book--the key search and the accompanying puzzle--came across like a video game, and well, if I wanna play a video game, I'll play a video game.But still, I had a great time and the pages flew by (by my anemic standards). I got a little tear in my eye once or twice, which was a pleasant surprise, considering "magic battles with skeletons" was all I really knew about it. (Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of that, too.) And I'm very curious about where the story is going next. The board's been cleared, and it'll be a whole new game. Maybe even an entirely different one.

2868381397	There were so many things for me to love about this book and I’ll probably reread a physical copy in the future because it has been one of my most anticipated reads ever. But I just could not get into the characters and the world even though they are all elements that I love.— overall: 2.5, DNF @57% —⇢ content warnings// (view spoiler)[Body horror (graphic), Death (including children), Gore, Injury, Murder, Mutilation, Necromancy, Self-harm, Suicide (depicted and referenced), Trauma, Violence (hide spoiler)]⇢ representation: Lesbian main character, Chronically/terminally ill side characterSIMILAR VIBES: NevernightREAD FOR: mysterious, gothic and dark in theory but humorous writing style “If you do not find yourself a galaxy, it is not so bad to find yourself a star.” Just the fact that this had a contest sort of setting is enough to make me reach for this book in the future. The writing is very visual, the bones, the necromancy... I love all of those elements and the way it technically plays into the magic system was so interesting. There was a lot more quirkiness than I thought it would have for a story about bones and dead people. But there was just something about how everything was woven together that was not working for me.The magic system was very well established and I love how necromancy was incorporated while making it sort of… whimsical rather than straight out dark. It was fascinating. I would definitely want to read more necromancy-based magic systems.The plot and world-building just throws you in and it’s very mind boggling at first so I thought that it would stick to that pacing all throughout but events started to slow down and my interest was just dwindling. Though I didn’t know where the story wanted to go and it just felt like everything was happening around our main character which I’m not exactly a fan of.I don’t know if it’s because of the audiobook but I already had it at a significantly slower pace than usual and I had the ebook but I just could not follow all of the characters names. Harrow and Gideon were the only blatantly clear to me. I loved that we finally got some non overly sexualized women in fantasy but then again... I couldn't keep track of all of them gahhhh. It was so frustrating.It was enjoyable reading about them but in my head they're just "that one character who died but it was funny" and "that one who was shirtless at that lake". I thought some of them were quite unnecessary and I didn't know how they fit into the plot. Granted I did DNF this so who knows.With all that, it was definitely entertaining and the humor definitely sold me. This gave me nevernight vibes and even though I loved the premise and the world, it just wasn’t keeping my interest. I could have read this just for more of Gideon and Harrow because I think they were the saving graceIt’s definitely something unique and in most cases I probably would have liked this as a lover of gothic, dark, and sci fi stories… but my interest just wasn't there.I have no other words to describe my feelings aside from frustrating because in theory, this is exactly my kind of story and I would have loved it if I was perhaps in a different mood. I was afraid I was going to get into a reading slump if I forced myself through this. “She was trained in the sword of heavy infantry,” plot: ★★★★☆writing style: ★★★☆☆world building: ★★★☆☆characters: ★★★★☆themes: ★★☆☆☆pacing: ★☆☆☆☆page turner: ★☆☆☆☆------------------- PRE READ: I was not aware that Gideon... was a sheI don’t know what I thought this was about before but I just found out that this is about assassins and necromancy... in SPACE 😳
