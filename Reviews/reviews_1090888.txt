258132265	Book Review 4 of 5 stars to Gaudy Night by Dorothy L. Sayers, a strong and talented writer of detective mysteries in their Golden Age of publication. This was truly an excellent book. Upon finishing my third year at college, I'd taken all the required courses and a variety of electives to complete my double majors. My advisors and professors, knowing I had an affinity for reading and writing mystery stories, encouraged me to do an independent study on this era of literature; but they also told me I wouldn't be allowed to select any of the books I had to read. She would pick two per month for me to read and discuss. And this was one of the very first ones... she was a big Dorothy Sayers fan and thought this was the author's most popular book. Despite it being in the middle of a series, which I severely dislike, I read it without enjoying the prior installments. And it turned out OK.Though it's hailed as a Lord Peter Wimsey book, it's really about Harriet Vane: young wife accused and jailed for murdering her husband; but she's been released when Wimsey proves her innocence. And they begin their own little flirtation and romance. Harriet goes on to be a writer and plans to visit her alma mater, a women's college in the 1930s... what an intriguing concept. Full of some feminism, some mystery, some romance, some education... I loved it, even tho at times it was a little too "eyes slanted down one's nose" for my taste.The writing is fantastic. The mystery is complex. And it's more about proving false clues, sometimes revisiting them, but always applying sound logic. Sayers helped pave the way for many future female authors of detective stories. Christie is still my preference, but I thoroughly enjoyed Sayers' approach and character-creation. If you enjoy 75+ year old stories, give this one a chance. It's really quite psychological and introspective. About Me For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

1984334738	Published in 1936, this 12th novel in the Lord Peter Wimsey Series is a big story. Dorothy L. Sayers created an entire women’s college (called Shrewsbury) in the large complex known as Oxford University. It is near an associate college called Queen’s and also near Balliol College, which is where Lord Peter Wimsey attended his university years. With Oxford University composed of 38 colleges and 6 Permanent Private Halls, it is not difficult to imagine Ms Sayers’ invention taking its place easily among the others.Harriet Vane is invited to her class reunion, known as a Gaudy. She has not gone before but decides to do so this time in answer to pleas from some of her former classmates. She surprises herself by enjoying the time away from home and renewing relations with various dons, Fellows, and classmates. At the end of Gaudy night, she finds an offensive drawing on the grounds of the Quad. She also finds an ominous note in the rolled-up sleeve of her gown.When she returns home, she dives back in to writing her most recent novel, which has been giving her trouble. Then, she receives a letter from the Dean of Shrewsbury, Miss Martin, who tells her about some ominous incidents that have been occurring since Gaudy Night. Poison Pen notes, things set on fire, random vandalism, and so forth. The Dean asks if Harriet Vane has any idea what it might be about.Harriet responds that she will return to the College and see if she can do anything to help.This is where we receive a taste of academic life that would be nostalgic for those who had gone to University, and like entering a new and fascinating world for those who had not gone to University. The discussions cover the gamut from literary topics to history to philosophy and science. I was obliged to search out many topics and references on the computer and had some great adventures.Both a reminiscence and reminder for some people as much as it is a new adventure for others - yet underlying the academia, we have this mystery – who is causing all the turmoil and terrors – and why? The focus seems to be the Seniors Common Room, so even the Dean, Treasurer, Warden, Bursar, and other dons and Fellows in the group are under suspicion. Gradually, as further incidents occur, Harriet is able to start eliminating suspects based on cast-iron alibis, but it is a slow and laborious process. Lord Peter is away on the continent – Rome and Warsaw – and as Harriet Vane progresses in her investigations, she documents the details in a notebook. However, a couple of attempts to hurt or kill people are causing her to wonder if she is equal to the task of finding this person before it’s too late. After a few more frightening incidents, Harriet decides she can’t do this alone and persuades the Dean to allow her to contact her “detecting friend” for help.I love it when these books include both Lord Peter and Harriet Vane. Their chemistry is fascinating and over the five years of their acquaintance, their individual personal growth is most closely observed when they are working on a mystery together.This book is not a fluff piece or even close to being a ‘cozy’ mystery or ‘classic’ mystery for that matter. This book stretched and expanded my mind. Dorothy L. Sayers is in a class of her own – intellectually, she doesn’t hold back. Psychologically and even scientifically, she is well ahead of the pack in both what she knows and how she writes. Until I lost my bookmarks and annotations, I was going to end this review with a brilliant quote about women that made me question: how far have we travelled really with feminism? Keeping in mind that this book was written 83 years ago, the answer is: not very far. Or – maybe Dorothy L. Sayers and her own set of classmates were simply decades ahead of the rest of the world.
4622364536	Gaudy Night successfully breaks barriers of mainstream genres with Harriet's (Dorothy's) musings on academic life and life after academia for women ringing true. The book is set in a fictional college with an ambitious number of female academics, yet the central battle between careers and marriage still resonates decades later. Oxford is beautifully described, a safe haven for scholars disturbed by tumultuous events caused by one of their own. This is not a classic murder mystery, though the danger of murder is prevalent. The story moves slowly, but steadily building momentum. The writing in this work is more literary than ever in the previous novels, echoing all the strong emotions here.Most remarkable in this book are the characters of Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane, and their growth over the last few years. They slowly break down barriers, admit their past follies and bravely try to change themselves. It is quite obvious that Sayers based Harriet Vane on herself, even if you are unfamiliar with her history. I wonder if writing Harriet and her journey was as therapeutic for Sayers as difficult it was for Harriet to overcome her past.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟[One star for the premise; One star for the story; One star for the writing; One star for the setting/ world-building; One star for the characters - Five stars in total].
2933197832	Abandonado al 22%. Muy bien escrito, sí. Y la trama es secundaria, sí. Lo que pretende es retratar las vicisitudes en un "college" como el de Oxford, sí. Pero, por favor, cuatro togas quemadas y tres notitas obscenas? En 1935 estoy seguro que pasaban cosas más interesantes. Basta con leer a Agatha Christie, Conan Doyle, etc. Hasta Wilkie Collins, años atrás, tenía cosas más emocionantes que contar.Aburrida. Tal vez la retome con posterioridad porqué tenía mucha esperanza puesta en esta autora.
125488566	Oh, my GOD, Dorothy L. Sayers is quite the snob! 2011 has been Mystery Year, it being when I started officially working as an attorney and having to read just to be entertained and this piece of crap made me want to swear off British whodunits forever. Luckily, Dame Agatha and Ngaio Marsh still deliver. The truth is, I like my mysteries to be about murders and this fricking bore was a crappy ¨who sent those ghastly, tastleless anonymous letters¨ affair. No murders about, and by page 20 I was ready for the main character to be murdered in the bloodiest fashion imaginable.
4132234	What is the deal with lady detective fiction writers? Why create a brilliant, memorable central female protagonist, totally capable of bringing teh awesome, only to undermine her by having her mope around after some overbred aristocratic prat? Case in point: that whole Havers-Linley dynamic would be infinitely healthier had detective Havers given pompous-assed golden boy Linley a good kick in the yarbles the very first time he tried to pull the whole tired aristo-boy superiority trick to put her in her place. Given the choice between Havers and Linley, I know who I’d want to have my back, and it wouldn’t be the effete aristocrat, no matter how hard Elizabeth George tries to protray him as a sensitive, noble, brilliant soul. But it’s Havers I feel sorry for – she really deserves better.*If you believe, as I do, that George’s apparent infatuation with her idealized aristocrat ultimately weakens the Havers-Linley stories, then what to make of the hero-worship that permeates the entire Peter Wimsey series? After all, isn’t Harriet Vane just an obvious stand-in for her creator, making Lord Peter nothing more than a vehicle for the vicarious fulfilment of Dorothy L. Sayers’s own romantic fantasies? Or, to use the terms I just recently learned from the infinitely amusing (but beware, it’s a complete timesuck) “Television Tropes and Idioms” website, isn’t Peter just the quintessential example of the Blue Blood trope, in response to Harriet’s Author Avatar?Well, no. Not really. Although Harriet Vane surely reflects her creator to some degree (something Sayers vigorously denied), it would be reductive to regard the character as nothing more than an author avatar. Sayers’s personal life was actually quite romantically adventurous, though this was not generally known during her lifetime. More importantly, Dorothy L. Sayers was smart as all get out (when she translated Dante, she respected that terza rima**, not like some wusses one could mention – yeah, I’m talking about you, Professor Ciardi). Any way you look at it, Harriet Vane rocks (out loud, and on lingonberry toast). And while I personally find it hard to take Lord Peter seriously, at least he has the virtue of being vaguely amusing, and nowhere near the kind of pompous ass that Inspector Linley manages to be. “Gaudy Night” is my favorite of all the Harriet/Peter books. There’s no murder, but the stakes are high, nonetheless. Poison pen letters and obscene effigies are being used to target the female scholars of a prestigious Oxford college. Sayers’s depiction of the mounting fear and disruption, and of the emotions swirling beneath the veneer of academic rationalism, is riveting. Lord Peter is relatively scarce, so Harriet is center stage for most of the story. It’s a neat story, expertly told, with that irresistible Oxford setting. You can appreciate it without knowing anything about campanology or mithridatism. And if you do happen to care about the trajectory of the Harriet-Peter relationship, then the ending of “Gaudy Night” will surely warrum the cockles of your sentimental heart. This is Dorothy L. Sayers at her best.*: EG is not the only authoress to consign her sleuth-heroine to an unsatisfying emotional limbo. Consider Jacqueline Winspear, creator of the delightful Maisie Dobbs series. In five or six meticulously researched, well-written, generally tightly-constructed stories, Ms Winspear tracks the exploits of her charming, plucky protagonist Maisie during World War I and the decade immediately following. Despite the odd lapse (placement of the telling historical detail is sometimes a little heavy-handed, the high-minded purity of motivation of Maisie and her friends can be excessive at times), Ms Winspear delivers the goods – stories in the series are reliably entertaining. But across a timespan of 15 years, the heroine is allowed little more than the occasional chaste peck on the cheek; for the decade or so after the end of the war the only release outlet for her emotional energy was through occasional visits to her irreversibly shell-shocked sweetheart (mercifully killed off in the fourth or fifth book). The unremitting bleakness of the emotional landscape Ms Winspear imagines for her protagonist is really starting to get me down, though I understand she may be making a point about life after the Great War for women in Maisie’s demographic cohort.**: Actually, the Sayers translation is not particularly readable, but I give her points for effort. TVTropes has much to say about Lord Peter, some of it quite penetrating:http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php...
2823568584	This review is for the Ian Carmichael audio version which is excellent. I am also reading it at a seperate time in print for our podcast The Literary Life Podcast. https://www.theliterary.lifeThis is a delightful reading of a thoughtful, masterful book. Perhaps the best Lord Peter Wimsey novel of Dorothy L Sayers, although from here on out they are all wonderful, even the short stories.
216171653	Lord Peter Wimsey is not the quintessential sleuth. He has a beginning, middle and presumably an end – by which I mean he develops as a character throughout the novels, unlike Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who resolutely stay as their eccentric selves from their first story to the last. Of course, there is a chronological progression of events; and Poirot actually dies; however as characters they are static. In contrast, we see Wimsey age and mature from a frivolous youth to an idiosyncratic middle-aged man – in the course of which he manages to woo and win the attractive Harriet Vane, the famous mystery author whom he manages to save from the scaffold.Wimsey and Harriet’s troubled love affair is an integral part of many of the novels. She keeps on rejecting his suit, because of her indebtedness to him; according to her, it would be like King Cophetua and the beggar-maid. However, Peter does not have such a holier-than-thou attitude, but he finds it difficult to convince Harriet, more so because of the subdued nature of his wooing. Of course, it is very clear to the reader that in her heart of hearts, she loves him.Dorothy Sayers had to put a satisfying end to this romance, while keeping her mystery stories ticking: she does a masterful job in this novel. As a mystery, I found it much below par than many of her other novels. However, the important thing here is the love story, which is adeptly handled.The novel, for much of its part, is driven by Harriet. She attends the ‘Gaudy Night’ in her old Alma Mater, the Shrewsbury College for Women in Oxford, where she gets a couple of nasty anonymous letters accusing her of getting away with murder. Since this is not all that uncommon in her life, Harriet does not pay much attention: but things take a serious turn when nasty things begin happening at Shrewsbury. A ‘Poison Pen’ is at work: worse still, the same person is behaving as a poltergeist, destroying property and writing obscene graffiti. The college’s reputation is targeted. The Dean and company do not want to call in the police, being frightened of the scandal it may create. Harriet is roped in as the investigator, later on joined by Wimsey, who as usual does an efficient job. During the course of the investigation, Harriet finally admits her feelings for Peter, and the story ends in a highly satisfying manner with the lovers locked in the traditional kiss.***The novel is overlong and rambling: and since there is no murder, tends to get repetitive with the atrocities committed by the miscreant. There are so many characters that one loses track sometimes. However, Sayers has done a fantastic job of creating the atmosphere of academe and the struggles felt by the women of early twentieth century, caught between the pleasures of the intellect and the demands of the flesh. In fact, the mystery itself centres on this dichotomy and the solution of it suddenly provides Harriet with the “Aha!” reaction with regard to her own confused feelings. The underplayed British humour is also there, very enjoyable as with any English novelist (Agatha Christie, P. G. Wodehouse) while describing love-struck youths behaving like imbeciles.I found that unlike her other mysteries, this one was best if taken at a slow pace, like a lazy Saturday afternoon on the university grounds.Review also on my BLOG .
2734323288	This is a mystery and they are trying to find... a vandalist. I mean sure, wayyy down the line of this book (300ish pages in of my edition, which is 550ish pages) there is an attempted murder. But for 300 pages the worst thing that happened was vandalism and some threats here and there. I didn't feel the pressing of the high stakes at all. Threats are something to take seriously, but when there was this many of them and no follow up action, I felt like this book lacked urgency. Which made it quite boring to read >.> Even excepting the case itself, I felt like this book dragged a lot, which made it so boring. T.T I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't read it for uni! I felt like there were so many elements of this book which could've been cut or trimmed down.Harriet was an okay character. She wasn't likeable or unlikeable either? So I didn't feel anything when reading from her persepective. And Peter is a genius but isn't present for a lot of the novel and when he is he is okay too. So I didn't hate anyone or love anyone so I felt bored because there was no character I had any passionate feelings for either way. The one good thing about this book is that it is really, really feminist. Which is always good to see in a classic book. It's not classic just because it's set in a female university when those were looked down on, but because of the discussions in the book, and how certain characters treat the women. I loved how the feminist feels were strong here. But that's the only thing I liked and it's not enough for me to give a book a higher rating than this.When the book ended I didn't really feel much other than relief that I had managed to waddle through the huge tome in time for my seminar >.>The only other book I have read by this author was Strong Poison which I rated three stars. So, unfortunately, this is going to be my last Dorothy L. Sayers mystery...
969874135	Can I give this book more than 5 stars? What a tour de force. In Gaudy Night, Dorothy Sayers follows not her usual hero, Lord Peter Wimsey, but instead his longtime love, Harriet Vane. Harriet is reluctantly persuaded to visit her old college at Oxford for its Gaudy Night celebrations. There she finds two vicious anonymous notes, one of them pushed into the sleeve of her academic gown! She returns to London, only to be called back a few months later by the administration; the college is being plagued by a series of pranks and anonymous messages just like the one she had received. She agrees to go live at the college for a few weeks and see if she can solve the mystery.The few weeks are drawn out into months, and the mystery draws her deeper and deeper into its coils. The obsessions of the prankster echo events from Harriet’s life, and the whole experience forces her to turn her assumptions and beliefs inside-out and upside-down. The book becomes at least as much an unraveling of her life as it is an unraveling of the mystery. Through it we get a vivid portrait of British academic life, for the tutors and the students alike. (Insert a number of memorable and delightful characters here.) Toward the end, Lord Peter comes on the scene, and his presence both complicates and de-complicates Harriet’s various dilemmas.I have always enjoyed Sayers’s detective fiction—well crafted, just the right level of intellectual, full of puzzles. But this novel is something much greater: it’s a Hero’s Journey with a bit of mystery attached. In her previous novels Sayers always viewed Lord Peter at arm’s length; we are allowed into some of his thoughts but mostly follow his actions. In Gaudy Night, we are deep inside Harriet Vane’s mind from the very start, and the result is a far more intense and personal experience. Many women will resonate with Harriet’s central dilemma, making the process of reading this book gripping and memorable.It seems that Sayers threw everything of herself into Gaudy Night—her heart and soul and every inch of her mind. She doesn’t hold back or coddle the reader. For me, it all adds up to a breathtaking reading experience. And the ending brought me, like many other readers, to tears.
718296929	Over a year ago now, Lord Peter pretty much saved my life. I was hysterical and still half under anaesthesia; the nurses were unsympathetic; I have an anxiety disorder as it is, let alone when I'm in a great deal of pain with insufficient morphine. My blood oxygen levels were catastrophic, even with pure oxygen. My mother forced her way onto the ward and held my hand. When they made her go, my blood oxygenation was up a little, but not much; she didn't let them send her away until she'd put her Kindle by my pillow, playing Edward Petherbridge reading Dorothy L. Sayers. Under that influence, I lay still and quiet, and listened, and breathed.Not coincidentally, Edward Petherbridge slightly overshadows Ian Carmichael in my affections, and I don't think I'll ever be able to read Gaudy Night without sympathising wholly with Harriet's realisation of her own feelings. I could find no fault with it this time, neither in the slow build or anything else. I don't think I'll ever be rational about Lord Peter again, and I was already a fair way to in love with the character.He can be ridiculous, but he's so good; sometimes, in the other books, I think I resented Harriet a little for her treatment of him. But she's in an awful position too, and Gaudy Night makes that clear -- and my goodness, the scenes where she starts to finally realise her physical (animal?) attraction to him are a little breathtaking. Peter's too perfect, of course, especially in Gaudy Night -- but in a perfect way I find impossible to fault!Sayers' Oxford is a lovely thing, too. Once upon a time, I went to Cambridge to look round and simply felt choked by it all, but I think that when I visit Oxford, I'll be ready and willing to love it through Sayers' eyes. It's a powerfully nostalgic version of university life, especially for someone currently struggling to get any help with a PhD proposal -- oh for Shrewsbury College and the community there!
478436850	Where I got the book: my bookshelf. This is a 1940 Gollancz edition I picked up somewhere and I absolutely love it because no matter where you are in the story, the book lays flat and keeps its place. I get so impatient with books that won't stay open.The story: five years after being erroneously accused--and then, thanks to Lord Peter Wimsey, acquitted--of murdering her lover, Harriet Vane is getting on with her life as a writer and puzzling over what she's going to do about Lord Peter: push him out of her life or accede to his marriage proposals? She's invited back to Oxford to visit her old college, where a mysterious prankster and writer of anonymous notes seems to have a grudge against academic women in general and Shrewsbury College in particular. Called in to investigate, Harriet ponders whether an intellectual woman should allow love into her life or whether retirement into a life of learning is the answer. The appearance of Peter in Oxford to help with her investigations could be disastrous--maybe.This is my favorite Wimsey book, and probably one of my favorite love stories of all time. It is, I think, Sayers' most feminist novel, showing women trying to carve out an existence for themselves that has nothing to do with men, and yet acknowledging that love and relationships can have a place in a woman's life without totally destroying her true self. I think Sayers is arguing for give and take; it's true even today that women make a certain sacrifice, far more than men do, when they enter into a marriage (the physical and emotional effects of childbearing and the change in status are still very real, despite our so-called progress) and I think Sayers is seeking, not so much an end to such sacrifice but an acknowledgement that it is real and should not be entered into lightly.After pulling Wimsey and Vane through two novels, Sayers is faced with the challenge of getting two emotionally scarred characters to the big Yes, and she does so through Harriet's eyes, using her beloved Oxford as the catalyst. In the (disturbed) peace of academe, Harriet is able to reconcile her past with her present, explore Wimsey's own vulnerabilities and finally acknowledge her physical attraction to him. It's that attraction, it seems to me, that's the clincher; Sayers clearly believes that marriage must be a union of bodies first and foremost, and that the emotional and intellectual side of things will sort itself out if the physical bond is strong enough.It's also interesting that Harriet's new insights into her own feelings bring about a revolution in her development as a writer. It's often been said that Harriet is Sayers herself, and indeed I have always had the impression that Sayers fell in love with her own creation, Wimsey, and wrote herself into the stories so that he could fall for her; a very interesting statement about the life of the imagination! Whether that's true or not, I happen to find Harriet convincing in her own right, but what she discovers about her writing in Gaudy Night may well be a reflection of Sayers' feelings about how a detective novel should be, i.e. no mere intellectual puzzle but a true novel with psychological growth in the characters. I think we take it for granted today that the characters in a novel should have a growth arc, recognizing two-dimensional characters for what they are and scorning them; I think we tend to forget that even some of the best writers of bygone decades tended to deal far more in caricatures and "types" than we would now accept. What we still read now are the ones that survived precisely because they were a cut above the others.Gaudy Night, famously, contains no murder but there are a whole lot of motives for murder, all centered on human relationships. Sayers tackles the demons (her own, I can't help but thinking) of possessiveness and jealousy, and the kind of love that wants to absorb its object. She argues for balance; but does she entirely achieve it with her lead characters? I'm not so sure.
3244314857	This one is much adored by Peter Wimsey fans because💠Harriet Vane's onstage for most all of it💠We get major Harriet-Peter developments💠Sayers' beloved dreaming spires of Oxford shine as the settingBut you'll have to wade through many, many old-college-girl conversations, not much Peter, and no Bunter.S.C.R. = senior commons roomJ.C.R. = junior commons roomW.P.B. = waste paper basketIf you think that's an *uproarious* joke, well then, you're good to go.
6376619295	I'm currently going through a stack of books I've taken off of my home library shelves that all have to do with one of my favorite devices in mystery novels, the infamous poison pen letter. I'm taking them in publication date order, beginning with Ethel Lina White's Fear Stalks the Village. I really have no clue why I have this sort of bee in my bonnet about these books, but hey -- it's a good way to read novels I've owned forever that are just sitting here unread and unloved. full post for Gaudy Night is here:http://www.crimesegments.com/2024/03/...I read this book earlier this month but as is the case with the other books I've read and stacked up next to my tablet, it's hectic around here leaving very little me time for posting my thoughts and likely to stay that way until the second week of April. Gaudy Night arrives late in Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series, and because I'd forgotten what happens in nearly every book to this point, I've had to do a massive (and quick) reread of all that came before. Well, not all actually; I skipped the short story collections and The Five Red Herrings after diving into it for a bit and got back on the track leading to Gaudy Night, promising myself I'd go back and pick them up another time, along with Busman's Honeymoon, the final original Wimsey novel. If the length of this book seems a bit on the daunting side, I was surprised at how quickly the five hundred-plus pages went by. The very first thing that anyone familiar with the earlier Wimsey novels will notice is that Gaudy Night is very different in comparison to those which came before. While Harriet Vane had earlier appeared in both Strong Poison (where she first meets Lord Peter while on trial for murder) and Have His Carcase (during which she comes across a body on a rock along the coast, beginning one of the strangest cases of the lot), here she takes center stage. The action in this novel stems from her attendance at a reunion at her Oxford College (the "gaudy" of the title), after which she is appealed to by the Dean for help and "advice about a most unpleasant thing" that has been going on there. It seems they have been "victimized by a cross between a Poltergeist and a Poison-Pen." The letters are easy to ignore, but not the "wanton destruction of property," the "last outbreak" having been "so abominable that something really must be done about it." I went into Gaudy Night for the poison pen letters and came out with something completely unexpected. At the core of this novel, well beyond the mystery of the Shrewsbury poltergeist, is Harriet's introspective look at herself on both the intellectual and personal fronts, which made me think that Sayers had invested much of herself in her character, an idea I couldn't shake even after finishing the book. So I looked online to see what others had thought. I found several people whose commentary was well worth reading, but maybe Lucy Worsley, in an excerpt from her A Very British Murder summed it up for me best when she quotes Sayers as revealing that in writing Gaudy Night, she was finally able to say "the things, that, in a confused way, I had been wanting to say all my life." My advice: read the series up to that point, especially the other books with Harriet Vane, before you start this novel -- you'll definitely want the backstory and for the most part, they make for fun reading. Gaudy Night was, as I mentioned, written in the 1930s so you get that sort of heavier style you often find in novels of the period, but once you get to the hub of this story you won't be able to put it down. A definite standout among them all, and as I see it, Gaudy Night is definitely still relevant in so many ways. Recommended.
1451114050	All the stars. This book was terrific and I'm sorry it had to labour for so many years under my impressions from when I last read it, probably about ten years ago.-Wow, where to start. OK, how about this: sometimes you read a book, and it meets you exactly where you are. It enunciates everything you've been thinking about and expresses everything you've been feeling. GAUDY NIGHT, however, was not one of these until the second time I read it. I'm not actually entirely sure it was in 2008 that I read this book first, but it can't have been any later. I didn't appreciate or sympathise with the book at all that first time, with the result that I spent a lot of time giving Dorothy Sayers the sidelong squint-eye. Well, better late than never, right?This is a Lord Peter Wimsey mystery, but it focuses on, and tells the story from the perspective of Harriet Vane, the woman Peter has (at this point in the novels' continuity) been pursuing stubbornly for five years. A successful mystery writer and sometime assistant to Peter in his investigations, Harriet is an alumnus of Shrewsbury, an Oxford women's college (fictional, of course). When someone starts sending threatening letters to the staff and students of Shrewsbury and vandalising the grounds, the professors worry that any scandal might injure Shrewsbury's reputation and women's education in general. So they ask former student Harriet to investigate.With Peter on a Foreign Office mission to Europe, Harriet has only her own wits and resources to call on. As the situation in Shrewsbury threatens to become fatal, Harriet senses that the time has come to make a final decision regarding Peter Wimsey. But nagging questions persist. Should a professional woman take on personal responsibilities? Can the life of the heart coexist with the life of the intellect? Is vocation and calling more important than marriage and family? Will marriage to Peter destroy her as an individual, or can it truly be a union of equals?A lot of this went over my head when I first read the book. In 2018, though, I'm reminded what a different person I am now. These days, I'm roughly the same age as Harriet Vane. Like Harriet, I'm somewhat of an intellectual. Like Harriet, I'm an author (though not as successful!). And like Harriet, I've come to realise that for a woman--and perhaps for everyone--being single means being single-minded in the pursuit of a calling. (Yes, this identification with Harriet is very new to me. She gave me the irrits as a teen).The whole book is very tightly-knitted in terms of theme, and the theme has to do with women and calling. GAUDY NIGHT is a book populated with professional women in a way that very few books are, especially those written in the 1930s. There's something, by the way, that feels fresh and faintly subversive (or perhaps I should say superversive) about how Sayers depicts these women. They may spend hours discussing philosophy and ethics, but are equally at home debating a dress or a hat.But all of them are busy trying to find that elusive "work/life balance". Early in the book, Harriet meets an old fellow-student who has married a farmer and spends her life helping him farm.What damned waste! was all Harriet could say to herself. All that brilliance, all that trained intelligence, harnessed to a load that any uneducated country girl could have drawn far better. The thing had its compensations, she supposed. She asked the question bluntly.Worth it? said Mrs Bendick. Oh yes, it was certainly worth it. The job was worth doing. One was serving the land. And that, she managed to convey, was a service harsh and austere indeed, but a finer thing than spinning words on paper."I'm quite prepared to admit that," said Harriet. "A plough-share is a nobler object than a razor. But if your natural talent is for barbering, wouldn't it be better to be a barber, and a good barber--and use the profits (if you like) to speed the plough? However grand the job may be, is it your job?"In GAUDY NIGHT, Dorothy Sayers insists that women, as much as men, may have specific callings. I know why I might have found this hard to swallow as a teen. Genesis 2:18 describes the first woman as designed to be "a helper fit" or "suitable" or "meet" for the first man. From this, Christians have accurately deduced that women are intended by God to join men in their callings. But in doing so, many have erroneously concluded that calling is not important for women as it is for men. A man may be called to anything, but a woman is only called to help whatever man is most important in her life at the moment. The result may be a refusal to treat women as individual members of the kingdom of God.There are a couple of problems with this, and Sayers pinpoints them unerringly in this book. First, and most powerfully, men can be wrong or even wicked. Ethics must always trump personal loyalty. One does not stand by one's man, right or wrong. A woman must have a strong sense of personal principle, which means that she cannot be defined by her relationships to other sinners. Second, women are quite as capable as men of important cultural work, whether as intellectuals or as farmers or mechanics or as family women. As a Christian, Sayers would of course have been aware that the dominion/cultural mandate of Genesis 1:28 was given to mankind as a whole, not specifically to men. The work of cultivating and tending the resources of the earth and its inhabitants is something which each individual in the kingdom of God is called to. So this an ethical question as well as a practical one, and I think Sayers shows keen insight in linking professional integrity with basic ethics.This cultural work, while it obviously includes family, is not limited to family. Indeed, the two may in certain cases come into conflict. Jesus specifically told us to be ready to give up family for his sake in Matthew 19:29. And if we have a robust view of individual calling in the kingdom of God, then we'll see that it has to extend to women as well as to men. Bojidar Marinov's comments on Proverbs 31 are excellent:The woman described here has a purpose for her life, an individual purpose that is only hers and no one else’s. She is not described as a passive participant in a collective; not even her family is described as a collective where she participates in some collective actions. Under some well-meaning but misplaced views of the family and the relationships within the family, some modern commentators are trying to present her as acting under the constant direction and supervision of her husband, as his errand boy or servant. But the text describes an independently-minded, self-motivated woman on a mission, an individual, personal, actively and aggressively pursued mission within a covenantal framework, not just simple obedience to someone else’s commands.From this perspective, Harriet's question becomes increasingly urgent: "However grand the job may be, is it your job?" Sayers isn't, of course, denigrating marriage, which is one of the truly refreshing things about this book. While Mrs Bendick is an example of a woman whose individuality has been "devoured" by her husband's calling, Harriet refers to her friend Phoebe's marriage as something else: a "collaboration". More examples abound. An overworked student, Miss Newland, is warned to get away from her work and find rest and companionship. A don, Miss de Vine, explains how she once broke her engagement after realising that she was more invested in her academic career than in her fiance. Another faculty member, Miss Hillyard, bitterly reproaches a married secretary for being unable to keep her mind on her job, and the secretary, Mrs Goodwin, ultimately agrees with her, giving up her job so that she can focus on the needs of her sickly young son. And obviously, this book is the book in which Harriet finally realises that she can find an equal match with Peter Wimsey--which is proven when despite his worry for her personal safety, he assists rather than hinders her investigations.There's a very good reason why Harriet finally accepts Peter's proposal while they're walking home from a concert. They have been listening to counterpoint music, and Wimsey makes the metaphor explicit. Marriage should be counterpoint, not harmony. It should be two individuals with different, but complementary callings, who find that they are more productive together than they are apart. And if you can't find someone who you will be more productive with, then perhaps you're called to be alone. It isn't wrong to be someone's helper, but it is wrong to ignore questions of fitness and suitability.Another of the refreshing things about GAUDY NIGHT is the fact that Sayers steadfastly resists to limit this question, of intellect/principle/profession versus heart/loyalty/family, to women. In one of the most important scenes in the book, Harriet and Peter have a long conversation with the Shrewsbury College faculty about exactly these questions. Their discussion revolves around a hypothetical man. The fact is, men also have family responsibilities that may interfere with their callings. They may feel called to do something which doesn't provide enough income to feed a family or which interferes with private life in some other way. The question, then, is so much bigger than feminism. It's the question of calling versus relationship, work versus life.Of course, the two shouldn't be disentangled and pitted against each other. The dominion mandate makes no wide difference between working the earth and populating the earth. Somehow, most of us are supposed to do both; and both work and relationships are to be ruled by ethics. But the dominion mandate was given in a perfect world, a world without death, a world of limitless time. As I was thinking it over after staying up late to finish GAUDY NIGHT, I couldn't help thinking of JRR Tolkien's wonderful, heartbreaking LEAF BY NIGGLE, which attacks the very same questions, only without the question of gender, and with more attention to the question of time and mortality. The reason why the question of calling versus family has any urgency at all is because of death. We aren't just cursed with pain in labour (of both kinds)--we're cursed with a very limited time in which to get anything done. But that should also remind us of our hope. Ultimately, those who submit themselves to the grace and ethics of God know they can look forward to an eternity of uncursed work and uncursed relationships. We can't get it all done in this life. But we can try, and we can wait eagerly for the life to come.Needless to say, I couldn't possibly recommend GAUDY NIGHT enough. I'm afraid that this has been less a review of the novel itself than an extended discussion of the thoughts I had while reading it, but I hope that whether you're reading it for the first or the manyeth time, you'll be inspired to push this one to the top of your reading list.
4721917114	Sloooowly and randomly working my way through the Vane-heavy novels in no particular order. In this one, Wimsey gives Harriet a dog collar (view spoiler)[that ends up saving her life! (hide spoiler)] so it makes sense that they get together in the end. Teasing aside, I've tried to read this two or three times before and bounced off the incredibly dry beginning chapters, but I suppose it was worth it to actually finish, just for everyone's musings on marriage and sexism and the incredible, pages-long rant of the denouement.
4579719529	A terrific tour de force from one of the world's greatest, some say THE greatest, mystery writers. Not only is there a very complex riddle to be solved, but the protagonist, mystery writer Harriet Vane (alter ego of Dorothy L. Sayers) wrestles with a long-standing personal issue which has been simmering for years and has finally come to a head. How long can she refuse the marriage proposals of her faithful admirer Lord Peter Wimsey?The chemistry between them heats up, yet Wimsey manfully refuses to pressure her. Harriet, a brilliant Oxford graduate who values the life of the mind, must come to the decision of her own accord. Her reluctance is due to her fear of subjugation within the marriage. Again and again Wimsey steps back, allowing her to find her own way. The writing is brilliant, the setting is Sayers' own alma mater, and the characters quite fascinating and at times, humorous.Almost as an afterthought, Harriet and Peter demonstrate how well-suited they are in their professional lives by solving the mystery together. This is just a great read.
3239360918	So it's all been leading to this, it turns out. I've casually enjoyed Lord Peter Whimsey for years now. But there's always been something missing. The mysteries aren't as intricate as Christie's, and the characters can come off as opaque in terms of internal motivation. It's almost as though Sayers was writing around her characters, afraid to fully inhabit them.Then, this book. It's not without its flaws. It's almost completely abstruse to anyone who hasn't a smattering of Latin or Elizabethan history. I'm pretty sure I missed 90% of the references. But the real story--the human interaction between Harriet and Peter--is just gorgeous. And in that light, the whole book begins to uncover layer after layer, each one richer than the last.I'm going to buy an expensive, nice, hardcover version of this, curl up with a set of annotations (there are several online and I'm intent on finding more), and mark this thing up until I'm drowning in the palimpsest (because this is a palimpsest, for sure). I can't wait to read this again.
1158655622	Own on Kindle.I finished Gaudy Night last night. It was wonderful. I had started and abandoned it a couple of times, but finally forced myself to keep on into the story. I wouldn't say it was un-put-down-able, because it was heady and there were places that I found quite difficult and needed a break. I suspect that this is a book that's best read multiple times for it's many-faceted levels. I think I was trying to follow too many facets at once.My biggest complaint was all of the names - too many names and sometimes two names for a single character (I never did quite get straight which Miss was the Dean, Bursar, or other office holder). (view spoiler)[I was able to follow the main players, including whodunit, though (hide spoiler)]. I was pretty proud of myself that I figured out early on who was the villain of the piece, and to some extent the motive, although I didn't piece together all of the elements to have actual proof.What I really found fascinating, though, was the philosophical discussion of what makes a good marriage? Why would a man and woman tie themselves together in such a relationship? What does a good marriage look like? What can we learn from a bad marriage? Sayers did a great job of returning her heroes to college where so many of us meet our spouses. By putting the story in Harriet's perspective, she challenges the reader with her own doubts and feelings and the whole story turns on this investigation of hers. The arguments from all sides - learned, uneducated, wealthy, poor, old, and young, and the misconceptions of what marriage can be, force Harriet to concentrate on the thing which in turn helps to make her own ultimate decision. (view spoiler)[Her decision to marry Wimsey after all pretense, beholdenness, and the walls between them have been stripped away was painful at times, but beautiful in the end. (hide spoiler)]I would like to read it again as the mysteries are now taken out of the equation. I think there is at least another level - philosophical and pyschological - that Sayers is discussing in this book that I just never got to. I caught glimpses of it from time to time and they left me a little confused (thus the 4 stars). Wimsey's dinner with the SCR is part of it for sure. I rarely felt I was on firm footing with conversations between Lord Peter and Harriet.There's enough British inter-war intrigue and allusions to British culture and Oxfordian culture that I don't understand that I'm concerned about my comprehension of that other level. I spent a lot of time in this book Googling for books, quotes, and phrases I'd never heard of. I found a very helpful page where someone has done translation work for me. I appreciated that Sayers brought up so many of the previous entries in the series as it had been some time since I'd read them. Those inclusions were helpful reminders and salient to this story.I can see why this is the favorite of so many people. I'm quite certain that it would only improve upon re-reads, and that's saying a lot because I liked it so much on this read and am ready to finish the series.
702694897	Only the second I've read in this series (the other was 'Strong Poison') and it's a very, very different book. Where 'Strong Poison' is a pretty standard, classic mystery, 'Gaudy Night' is (it seems) almost an autobiographical novel, with a mystery shoehorned in.I loved, loved, loved every detail of what it was like to be a female student at Oxford back in the day (Sayers attended from 1912-1915). It's a vivid, realistic, and very human depiction of the academics and their day-to-day lifestyle, their lofty intellectual concerns and their petty foibles - all come together to make this book an invaluable and amazing historical document.However, the mystery, such as it is, didn't grab me. I couldn't bring myself to really care too much about who the 'poison pen' tormenting these women was. I've never cared for mysteries which end in an overlong expository explanation of why all the villainy occurred.The romance aspect was also aggravatingly frustrating. I found Peter Wimsey to be a self-important twit, and, I'm sorry, but although, yes, one should be certain that a potential romantic partner respects you as a person, I don't find Harriet Vane stringing him along for FIVE YEARS to be romantic or feminist - at that stretch of time, it's just being an inconsiderate, indecisive jerk.Definitely worth reading, however. I'll read more of the series.
4860734992	Mentioned among top mysteries by women and much deserving of that accolade.Written in 1935 and set in Oxford, the underlying theme is the newness and lack of acceptance of women among the scholars guild. So, it is very worthwhile from that perspective. However, the writing is of its time--somewhat strained--and the romance between Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane is also rather rococo. Still, I recommend this to all who like the Lord Peter Wimsey series, who study women's history, who like university-set mysteries, and who like English cozies. Again, to Ms. Sayers' credit, she addresses--in the background of an entertaining and suspenseful mystery--the hard lift women have historically had being taken seriously in endeavors outside the home.
7670577392	It took a while for me to get into but great once I did, so a longer lead up than I'm used to. Most of the characters are women, and it was interesting to read about them and their struggles to be educated at university level and in particular Oxford. It might be one of the first feminist books so interesting in that regard. There are tons of period details (just before WW2) that seem a bit quaint and silly but very true to the period. There is classism, misogyny, and its portrayal of women is very dated if interesting. The main character, Harriet Vane, I didn't particularly warm too, but she grew on me. She is flawed but strong and compelling. Harriet calls on Peter Whimsy to assist her in solving the crimes.They have a 5 year friendship and Harriet graples with herself over his marriage proposals. A whodunit mystery, the main crime being poison pen letters with a love story intertwined. A product of the 1930's when it was written but interesting, never the less.
6817639142	What girls want: self defense lessons from their situationship, to be proposed to in Latin, to experience eros for Oxford, to do crimes of honor, to stick together, and to spend their life’s labor to create one excellent footnote. Highs and lows in this one for me, but to all a very happy fall book club!!
404011187	2019This continues to be one of my favourite books. It always sits with me slightly differently. I love Harriet's relationship with the Dean and the Warden in this. I was also particularly struck by her conversation with Miss Vine, about the value of detachment, and the value of people who will like her because of that particular quality. Particularly Harriet's line about how she makes herself uncomfortable.It's really just such a well thought out book.Also, the scene where she and Peter go punting on the river is a joy. Plus everything in my earlier reviews still stands, especially re: the chess set.2019 Reading Challenge - A book set on a college or university campus2017 RereadApparently this book is something I feel the urge to reread sometime around Christmas/New Year's. Not traditional holiday reading to be sure, but whatever.I still love this. I really like Harriet's narrative voice, and how she can forget about Peter for a while when she's engrossed in something else, but not completely. I also really enjoy how the discussion of her work features in this, how she's clearly transitioning from a more jigsaw puzzle sort of mystery novel, to one where her characters are humanized. (view spoiler)[Peter's reaction to learning that she's let him into her work is fairly excellent. (hide spoiler)]I suppose I just enjoy my romance of the heart and the mind. Along with a mystery set in Oxford.Also, the Dean entertains me.(And the chess set is still the most upsetting part.)2016 RereadFinally got around to rereading this book this week.I think I might have loved it more the second time around. And I loved it a lot the first time around.I really love everything about this. I love the setting. I love the character work. I love the introduction Saint George Wimsey. I adore the relationship development.I love the dialogue re: heart v. mind.I love how clearly the whole thing is set up as a choice.Also, "A marriage of two independent and equally irritable intelligences seems to me reckless to the point of insanity. You can hurt one another so dreadfully."And I'm still upset about the chess set.xxxSo after a period of absence of three years or so, I'm finally getting back to Lord Peter (and Harriet) (Also, I recognize that this was a ridiculous place to vaguely drift away from this series for whatever reason. I know no one stops right before Gaudy Night). The thing is, I really enjoyed this book a lot, but I don't know how to review it. I almost thing I'd need to read it again to really get it, or rather for it to really sink under my skin. It's a book for rereading, I think. And I can see why they're such a classic couple. There are moments in the middle that are so very well done, so very well done. And the more I sit with the ending, the more I like it. Something about the way they both value their independence and their principles, and I don't know. It's still just out of reach. It just felt like such a well crafted book, right from the start. The kind of book that you pick up and read a page and think, "Oh, this is a good book."On the other hand, it has also reinforced my conclusion that if I ever actually met Lord Peter, I would have a constant urge to punch him in the face.You know, I think that's why this worked for me. (view spoiler)[I understood so very clearly why Harriet wouldn't marry him. So clearly. And in many ways she's such a non-traditional female heroine... And I was more upset by the smashed chess set than anything in a long time. Not the kind of sad that makes me want to rant or gripe about it, but just quietly sad. (hide spoiler)]Oh, this book...I really don't think I can talk about it anymore.2015 Reading Challenge - A Mystery or Thriller (no, I wasn't saving that category for this...)
4030735645	I needed a palate cleanser and came in search of a refreshing Wimsey sorbet. What I got instead was a Vane suet pudding.The tag line on the cover of my copy calls this "A Lord Peter Wimsey Mystery". Actually there are two Wimsey mysteries. The first is why his name's in the tag line at all. He barely appears until the book's last quarter, by which time it's become so dull that even he promptly falls asleep. The crime is inane, and the suspects a morass of characters who are virtually indistinguishable. It's hard to feel much suspense about whether the culprit is Miss X or Miss Y when you can't remember which is which.The second Wimsey mystery, of course, is what on earth he sees in Harriet Vane, the world's dreariest protagonist.Lesson learned: next time, go Route One and just reread Murder Must Advertise.
1842484651	October 2022 — My but I love this one! I missed the discussion when one of my book groups read it a couple of years ago. I was expecting to miss again when my other group discussed it this week, but the hostess ended up also being under the weather, so we've rescheduled for next week.March 2020 — Was sooooo disappointed to miss the book group meeting where we discussed this one. I didn't finish it for another week or so as I needed more brainless amusements while recovering from a cold (yes...just a cold!). Anyway, loved it even more this time around, I think. And loved Ian Carmichael even more, too. December 2016 — My only disappointment with this book was the abominable failure of my memory to be its usually abominable self. I remembered, from a TV version viewed eons ago, whodunnit. Other than that...golly, can Sayers write people! My favorite of the series so far, and one I hope to reread regularly. Ian Carmichael as reader was, again, perfection.
6379879784	Probablemente la novela más famosa de Dorothy L. Sayers y considerada una de las mejores novelas de detectives de la Historia. Y a ver, está bien, es interesante, es más de temas y personajes de lo que sería Agatha Christie, pero si lo que se quiere es un puzle súper currado, esta no es la novela. Este es un libro de atmósfera y de creación de tensión, pero no pasa mucho en realidad y no hay asesinatos. Como novela sobre un colegio (un College en este caso) en el que se va acumulando el suspense hasta que estalla prefiero con mucho "La señorita Pym investiga", pero esta novela está bien. No se empieza de verdad con la investigación hasta la página 400, pero es entretenido de leer. Excepto por lo pedante que es la protagonista y la falta absoluta de notas de la traductora que confía ciegamente en las capacidades de los lectores. Aun así, con sus peros, ha sido interesante de leer.
1257627767	Like I said in a status update, this is a great book that I'm going to have to re-read to fully appreciate. So this probably won't be a very in depth review.Of course, (view spoiler)[I spent a long time waiting for Peter to show up!, but I'm very, very glad this was really Harriet's book. That needed to happen for the love story to work. (hide spoiler)]Also, (view spoiler)[ I JUST KNEW THE CHESS SET WOULD BE DESTROYED. *cries* (hide spoiler)]The ending was great and I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT ONE.
831160423	Two or three summers ago I was reading this book but then put it back on the bookshelf of the holiday cottage we were staying in. But then, a few weeks later, a friend we were on holiday with gave me a copy for my birthday: she had noticed I was reading it, but maybe hadn’t noticed I had put it back several days before leaving. I had not finished it through choice, but now I felt obliged to finish it, it would be churlish to ignore a gift. But I made the mistake of not reading it straight away: when I finally got around to returning to it, over two years later, I couldn’t remember what was happening and had to start at the beginning. I hadn’t previously read any Dorothy L. Sayers and this is way into the Lord Peter Wimsey series, the penultimate book. And Sayers has a confidence in her readership: she has the freedom to use the whodunit form as she wants and her fans will keep with her. It’s a long thriller and, for a whodunit, very leisurely: it isn’t as tightly plotted as I would expect a whodunit to be, Sayers spending a lot of time exploring other concerns of the characters. And her hero, Wimsey, although always an important influence, is absent from much of the novel. The central character is Harriet Vane (and we are filled in about how Wimsey had previously saved her from a murder charge and habitually proposes marriage to her): for those of us who get annoyed by the know-it-all detective she should be more interesting: her expertise is limited, although she does her best. The detective plot is about poison pen letters, obscene graffiti and vandalism that is occurring at Vane’s old Oxford college. Because it is a whodunit we might expect these incidents to escalate to murder, but Sayers is not bullied by our expectations. It is only in the last 150 pages or so, when Wimsey arrives and starts to shift through the clues, that it becomes more of a focused whodunit...and Wimsey, in that annoying detective way, announces he knows the culprit, but doesn’t let us in on the secret until the end. I find Wimsey an annoying character...I get fed up with being told how wonderful he is...and he is clever and aristocratic and good at cricket and has a profound understanding of music and is an idealised member of the British establishment, i.e., he is boring. (And I find his monocle slightly disturbing: it is obviously an affectation, but today can a monocle signify anything other than Prussian bullying or English upper class twitishness?) But the book has a Big Theme: it questions whether a woman can have a career, independence and a sense of self while being married. This is discussed largely through Vane’s uncertainties about her relationship with Wimsey, but the lives of the female Oxford dons and the crimes (notably the motivations of the criminal once exposed) tie into the theme. But the problem is that the novel tends to ‘discuss’ its themes, the characters talk them over, but they aren’t really enacted. I find it all a bit stodgy and heavy handed. And I’m not convinced that the Big Theme and the crime narrative have much to do with each other until the end: they just clunk along on their different tracks. This is why I find the book a bit dull, but it doesn’t explain why I find it annoyingly unpleasant. The novel begins with Vane returning to her college for a Gaudy Night, a sort of student reunion: she is staying in a room of an absent undergraduate and she looks around and notes that the student has no ‘natural taste’; during the reunion the old graduates are quickly defined in terms of their clothes, their worth designated by their taste, those that fail being scorned. I wondered if this was going to be a theme that the book would work through and expose, but, of course, it isn’t: the book is just very snobby...and nastily snobby. ‘Natural taste’ is the taste of people like Harriet Vane and Peter Wimsey (and Dorothy L. Sayers), the taste of the British ruling elites (or the better part of them, the cultured parts)...and that the ruling elites have ‘natural’ good taste shows their ‘natural’ superiority. And the reader is invited to share this sense of superiority: we, of course, share the tastes of Vane and Wimsey. I don’t generally spend much energy wondering who done it, but it occurred to me that it would be one of two people: one because she was a totally unlikely suspect and therefore her exposure would have been a complete surprise for the reader, the other (and there was a little circumstantial evidence to support this idea) because she was a member of the lower orders. I will let you guess who it was. (Although one of the strongest passages of the book is when the culprit denounces her accusers once she has been exposed.)
2131518667	Jesus, this was so boring!It's stunning how often one gets mislead by Goodreads' ratings. In this specific case I was looking for a classic "whodunnit", an easy, old-fashioned British mystery was all what I was in the mood for and - having read all old Agatha gave us - I decided to try a new author, certain that the highest rated novel in the series could not disappoint me.Unfortunately, and for unfathomable reasons, Ms Sayers' fans decided to give their highest rate to the only novel that isn't really a "whodunnit".It's not just that nobody is killed here (the only mystery is a bunch of anonymous defamatory letters sent to respectable professors of a female college, that is also stage of random acts of vandalism) but the author is more interested in writing a social pamphlet than caring about the actual plot.All Sayers cares about is reflect on the impossibility, for women, to combine marriage and children with a successful and fulfilling career. This was an anomaly in 1930's England but it is often impossible also in contemporary Italy, so the theme is quite interesting and not at all obsolete.However this is, or should be, a novel so the author could have made the subject alive by letting her protagonists "live" all the different sides of the problem instead of condemning them to discuss the matter endlessly.The book is an succession of long, polite and extremely educated conversations between college professors and the personal thoughts of the protagonist (our amateur detective Harriet) who spends almost 500 pages turning the same thoughts inside out.To make things worse, my personal ignorance about the internal structure of a typical English college made the book quite difficult to follow: for the most part I got lost between dons and Dean, New Quads and old Tudor and the author complicated things by introducing dozen of characters in a few pages, forgetting to give them whatsoever personal traits and enjoying alternating in the same sentence the name and the title of these characters.I've not been reading classic literature for some time now, so I'm a bit out of practice in navigating the complications and formalism of conversations between educated people who lived a century ago, however the author could have helped by not stuffing the Dean, the Warden , Miss Edwards, Miss Pyke, Miss Baring, The Bursar, Miss Martin and other dozen on Miss all in the same page (those were only 5 people by the way,not 7, but you'll start get the hang of it only in the last 50 pages) and giving all them at least the resemblance of the personality, so that the reader could learn to distinguish between one and another.I will not comment on the mystery in itself, it is almost impossible to follow if you don0t know the dynamics of an English college and, even if you do, you'll still fall asleep every other pages, so forming a personal opinion on the subject is quite difficult.
1523440030	We had a friend who was, from the time we met him until just a few years ago, the most rollicking, fun, interesting bachelor ever. I used to fantasize how great it would be once he settled down with a rollicking, fun, and interesting woman and started having kids of the, yes, rollicking, fun, and interesting persuasion. We would totally have Gatsby dinner parties -- the wine, the stories, the laughter. They would be the ideal couple-friends. Then, he did meet someone. And they got married. And they had a kid. Unfortunately, she is dour, depressing, and controlling, and we never really see our friend anymore.And I think this sad story kind of sums up how I feel about Harriet Vane and Peter Wimsey. The early Wimsey could benefit from a good woman in his life, so when I heard about Harriet, I was all for the love-match. Bring it on! Now, having seen the two in action over the course of three books, I think, "Run, Peter, run!" Harriet Vane is a basket case.Anyway, Gaudy Night is a bit of a chore to get through. The crime is so uncompelling, the pacing is so slow, the side plots are so inane, the Oxford minutiae is so byzantine, I cannot rate this book highly. Someone is putting Shrewsbury College, Oxford on pins and needles with insinuating anonymous letters and crude, sexualized drawings. Dons and scholars and some students are receiving them, and all circumstances point to an inside job. But, who could the poltergeist be? And, more importantly, who cares? Certainly not I.Harriet is called in to help, partly because she is an alumna, partly because she writes detective fiction, and partly because she had an illicit affair that ended with the death of her lover for which she stood trial for murder, but was sprung on evidence nosed up by Peter Wimsey. At least, that's how it seemed to be. I'm still not quite sure why they would bring Harriet into the school to investigate. I think it mostly must have been so that Dorothy Sayers could write endless paragraphs about "school days, school days" from Harriet's point of view. Harriet's needlessly tragic point of view. Her endless feelings of self-pity and her endless peering into her own navel filled this reader with annoyance supreme. It is a 500+ page book that could have used 200 pages taken out and at least half of the characters removed. And Harriet needs a new personality. The end.
47540514	Re-read, November 2021: There’s so much to take in with this book, and even though I’ve read it 3 or 4 times now, every time it still feels like a fresh peeling back of the layers and trying to understand. It’s a bit more complex than what I can competently parse, but I do love it so.——————————Original review:The dialogue and prose in Gaudy Night is some of the richest I have ever read. It's very dense and it takes time to understand it, but that's what creates such a connection between me and this book. Hours after finishing the last page, phrases from it still roll around in my head to be savored.This volume contains the resolution for a romantic relationship three books in the making, and, incidentally, one of the most thoughtful adult relationships I can recall in fiction. Much as I enjoy reading about the Mr. Darcys and Mr. Rochesters of the literary world, you can have them all and leave me Lord Peter Wimsey. He's the one with the real power of mind, heart, and words.I have heard that Dorothy Sayers, having created her detective and slowly endowed him with great complexity, more or less fell in love with him, and created a match for him in "Harriet Vane," a stand-in for herself. It wouldn't surprise me at all. His blend of intelligence, compassion, wit, honesty, affectation, nervous energy, and control is unique, contradictory, and hardly imaginable in the real world, but very appealing.I also love Harriet Vane a lot. Her honest analytical mind is only enhanced by her all-too-relatable emotions as she tries to work out whether it is possible to balance the demands of brain versus heart. Favorite passage:"I suppose one oughtn't to marry anybody, unless one's prepared to make him a full-time job." "Probably not; though there are a few rare people, I believe, who don't look on themselves as jobs but as fellow-creatures."
24533316	Oxford has provided the background to many detective stories, and it’s a great setting for a crime novel. What interesting about Gaudy Night is that Sayers doesn’t just use it as background - the human and professional dramas afflicting the women of Shrewsbury College are the real meat of the book. You could argue that the detective story in this case is merely the background detail! Sayers is attempting something quite ambitious for 1936 - this is a detective story, a love story, and a serious analysis of the problems facing women who choose to pursue careers. It’s very definitely a feminist novel. It’s also ambitious in that Sayers is trying to create characters with a genuine inner life, rather than mere cogs in the machine of the plot.Although Lord Peter Wimsey certainly figures in the book the central character is very much Harriet Vane. Like Sayers, Harriet is a Oxford graduate and a writer of detective fiction who has led a somewhat scandalous personal life (although Sayers managed to avoid public scandal). She was undoubtedly using this character to work through some personal issues. She also uses both Harriet (a fictional writer of detective stories) and Lord Peter (a fictional detective) to playfully send up the crime fiction genre. A very impressive piece of work. I like Sayers more and more.
7143112617	I've been listening to the Shedunnit podcast, and it put me in the mood to reread some Sayers. Gaudy Night was always my favorite of her novels because it is partly a campus novel and it's from Harriet Vane's perspective. I enjoyed it just as much this time around as I did earlier. Harriet's attitude toward Lord Peter is a little inexplicable, but the campus setting is so perfect. All of the characters in the Senior Common Room are distinct and interesting, and their conversations are entertaining - as are Harriet's snarky comments about former classmates and the people she meets. Overall, this is still one of my favorite mysteries.
1100198926	I have read this novel at least 5-6 times before. [Due for a reread.] This isn't a Whimsey novel, and readers merely looking for an engrossing murder mystery entirely miss the point of this detective story that is not about a murder but about women's minds.Obviously, I love this novel. I love it for the Oxford setting, for the serious review of the life of mind and heart, of thought and passion, of love and devotion. I love it because the characters review arguments that 110 years later we are stilled arguing, however much I wish they might be settled. I love it for being smart and clever and because the first three times (or four?) that I read it I did not know the criminal until the reveal, even when I had read it already, I was dazzled by the philosophy and ideas and characters and their various opinions and virtues. Every 7 years. For half my life I read this novel every seven years. It was only in the third or fourth reading that I immediately recalled the whodunnit. The story so engrossed me that I stayed right along with Harriet through three readings. The culprit was not the focus and it was thrilling each time! I have more recently been reading her academic work. Like other women writers of popular fiction, once she had no need of that income, she continued writing, but other work.It is probably not the one to start with. However clever, it benefits from some familiarity with the characters involved. Recently (2016?), I meant to read them in order, but I skipped from Strong Poison to Gaudy Night and now I will have to back up, at least for Have his Carcass, though I already recall how tis done, if not by whom. "Is it true? is it kind? is it necessary?" I have found this line attributed to everyone from Socrates and the Buddha to a Quaker prayer book and Mona Simpson. Peter Whimsey said it in 1936, so that lets out Simpson. In fact, This widely memed quotation comes from a Victorian poem in Miscellaneous Poems (1872) by Mary Ann Pietzker. IS IT TRUE? IS IT NECESSARY? IS IT KIND? —Mary Ann PietzkerAnd if 'tis true, for one I suppose You would not tell a lie;Before the failings you expose Of friend or enemy:Yet even then be careful, very; Pause, and your words well weigh,And ask if it be necessary, What you're about to say.And should it necessary be, At least you deem it so,Yet speak not unadvisedly Of friend or even foe,Till in your secret soul you seek For some excuse to find;And ere the thoughtless word you speak, Ask yourself, "Is it Kind?"When you have ask'd these questions three -- True,-- necessary,--Kind,Ask'd them in all sincerity, I think that you will find,It is no hardship to obey The command of our Blessed Lord, --No ill of any man to say; No, not a single word.
1329098276	This book hasn't stood the test of time. I love literary books (not that this is one). I love books written in different eras and in different styles. And I don't, by any means, need lightening-fast-paced plots. Taking a little time is a good thing. All that being said, this is one of the slowest and most tedious books I've read in quite some time.A good story certainly lurks within the pages. But in order for that story to emerge, some serious and drastic editing needs to be done. The book is over 500 pages long. At least half of that could be cut. Without exaggeration. There are so many endlessly repetitive conversations, description after description of activity that isn't germane to the plot whatsoever, filler after filler after filler. After the first 200 pages, I skipped to the last 100. Read a few pages, then skipped to the last 30. So very glad I did. Reading the last 30, it didn't seem that I missed anything in the more than 250 pages that I skipped.Another problem. The book, written in the 1930's, explores the place of women in university and intellectual circles, their right to be there, their more than equal intelligence, etc. Excellent! But who ends up solving the mystery? Not Harriet Vane, on whom most of the book focuses, and who spends the entire book trying to solve the mystery. No, not her. Peter Wimsey solves the mystery. A huge letdown.Another problem. Harriet Vane isn't a particularly likeable or interesting character. Nor does she come across as particularly intelligent. It seems entirely perplexing why Wimsey loves her. She isn't a pleasant person with whom to spend any time.The book brightens considerably when Wimsey is on stage. He seems three-dimsensional, with a distinct personality. A few of the female characters at Oxford also brighten the read. I wish one of these women had been the main character.
2888471330	Continuing with my orgy of listening to Dorothy L. Sayers novels on audio, I've listened to the Gaudy Night (1935), the penultimate book in the Wimsey/Vane mystery cycle. As with the other audio reviews, I am not focusing so much on the whole story here. If you'd like to see my thoughts on the novel, please see my review on a print edition. Ian Carmichael gives another fine narrating performance, giving voice to a full range of characters from dons and students at Oxford to American visitors to members of the college staff. This particular round of hearing the story, I was reminded how much I enjoyed the interactions of Lord Peter with Mr. PadgettFor some reason, this affair of a mop and a bucket seemed to have made Padgett Peter’s slave for life. Men were very odd.as well as Harriet's encounters with Reggie Pomfret and Peter's nephew Lord St. George. There is a great deal of humor in this novel of poison pen antics at a women's college. Of course, there are also more serious themes from the eternal question of romance between our two main characters to the value of intellectual honesty versus the well-being of a man and his family. Sayers addresses some interesting intellectual subjects under the guise of an entertaining mystery with romantic undertones. Carmichael brings humor, warmth, and depth to his reading of the story.First posted on my blog My Reader's Block. Please request permission before reposting. Thanks.Reread on 5/10/22.

1749692802	Without appearing too gushing, I do not believe I can exaggerate how much I love Dorothy Sayers. I didn't always feel this way. The first book I read, "Whose Body" didn't impress me at all. I felt Lord Wimsey was rather callous in his glee at discovering a dead body in the bath and Oh boy! another murder to solve. How considerate of the murdered man.Sayers is a complicated person and I have a couple of biographies of her waiting for me and I will be very interested to get more information on what I so far am finding to be a fascinating individual. What little I know of her already leads me to believe that "Gaudy Night" has some autobiographical overtones in it. We have a woman in her thirties, Harriet Vane, who has come to an occasion at her Alma Mater, Oxford. The occasion is called a "Gaudy", which according to the Web, is a college feast that also serves as a reunion for past students.Harriet does not want to go for a number of reasons. She lived with a man she was not married to which in the twenties was scandalous.To make matters worse, her lover got murdered and she was the primary suspect until Sir Peter Wimsey saved the day. Wimsey, a social butterfly, finally alights and falls in love with Harriet, but she is unable to trust anyone. This theme is thread throughout the book and thus the book serves as both a mystery and also possible romance, neither of which is resolved until the end.You can read my entire review on my blog: http://sharonhenning.blogspot.com/201...
3781955863	This feels more autobiographical than a mystery, as Harriet spends a lot of her time in her old school at Oxford. There is much discussion about prejudice against women of learning, and against unmarried women, especially those who choose career over marriage. Among the highlights of the book are learned conversations about philosophy and science with an almost all-women cast, the likes of which were abundant in Victorian literature, but with only male participants.Harriet spends much of her time on introspection, and also re-evaluating why she is running from Lord Peter, and during a memorable afternoon boat trip (referenced in To Say Nothing of the Dog, which I am reading at the same time), gazing at the dozing Peter, she realizes that she loves him. There is also a mystery, but it plays very much in the background, with the main theme being Harriet and the life and faculty of an eminent women’s college in the thirties. I actually did not care for the mystery too much, but I enjoyed the book, and the interactions of the nearly all female cast.
2624152368	It's not often that I'll jump into a book series by starting with book 12, much less enjoy the read, but this was a happy exception. The backstory between Harriet Vane and Lord Peter is made clear enough in the opening chapters, and the unfolding mystery/romance is delightful. I don't even like mystery (or romance!) as a genre all that much, but Sayers brings such charmingly dry wit (snark, even) and understated literary brilliance to the story that the plot could have gone in just about any direction and still have been a fantastic read. The setting and time period of this book are particularly interesting, and throughout the book, the various characters fall into discussions of eugenics, a woman's place in society, the rise of Nazism, the clash between personal considerations and disinterested adherence to the truth, psychological analysis, degrees of responsibility for evils committed by others, sexual morality, and the politics of academia, among others. This is far more complex than any run-of-the-mill whodunnit and far more tasteful and mature—and far more entertaining—than the usual tale of boy-meets-girl. In short, I loved it.
2547097535	An extremely involved, beautifully complicated mystery, with gorgeous descriptions of university life and environs. The story has a distinct feminist bent and so I’m not satisfied with the ending between Harriet Vane and Lord Peter Wimsey. It feels like a cop out, but more true to the times, perhaps? Otherwise, I loved it!
1496570178	Sayers is eerily smart about human nature - this is something more than the average whodunit. It's not just a clever crime, it's a wonderful love story and a thoughtful response to the question of what makes a good romantic partnership. Gorgeous.
5029198738	I haven't read this book in maybe 20 years. Coming at it with more age and life experience behind me made this book infinitely more pleasurable. I read this with my intown book club and we haven't met to discuss yet but I'll drop my 5 stars here anyhow. This book is brilliant.
142965066	One of my top 5 books of all time. Not only an extremely well-done mystery, but also a fascinating glimpse into women's education in the 30s and the all-too-familiar issues they grapple with.
46791074	Beautiful language, gloriously ridiculous plots, and the first to bring the emotional life of her characters into the fore of the mystery. (Even though she did insist on apologizing for it.)
6726130067	Knyga, apie kurią vienas mano bičiulis pasakytų „netikras detektyvas“. Jam detektyvas be lavono – ne detektyvas. Negaliu labai jo smerkti už tokį požiūrį, yra tiesos grūdas tame. Bet žinot, duokit man daugiau tokių „nedetektyvų“, kaip „Gaudy Night“.Visų pirma, čia sugrįžta Harriettė. Sugrįžta, sakyčiau, su trenksmu – čia sofitų šviesoje šoka būtent ji, Peteris Wimsey pirmąsyk pasirodo tik įpusėjus knygą. Visų antra, tai, kaip Sayers išspaudžia pavojaus ir nerimo jausmą be jokio lavono – verta pagyros. Na, ir trečia, knyga – savotiška odė Oksfordui. Manęs, žinia, niekas su juo nesieja, bet nepajusti tų nostalgiškų jausmų, kuriais Sayers pripildė šitą romaną – neįmanoma.Žodžiu, Harriettė pakviečiama į Oksfordą, į bendramokslių susitikimą. Vyksta kaip ir pramogai, bet įvykiai priverčia pasilikti čia kur kas ilgesniam laikui. Harriettės koledže vyksta nesuvokiami dalykai – kažkas siuntinėja studentėms ir dėstytojoms anoniminius laiškelius su grasinimais, aprašinėja sienas nešvankybėmis, sunaikina vienos dėstytojos mokslinį darbą, koledžo kieme sukrauna laužą iš profesorių mantijų... Panašu į padaužos, kokių pasitaiko kiekvienoje mokykloje, išdykavimus. Tačiau už viso to jaučiasi neapsimestinis pyktis ir pagieža. Ir nuojauta – kad nežinomasis „išdykėlis“ savo pokštais gali nueiti gerokai per toli. Harriettė bando išsiaiškinti, kas krečia visas tas piktas išdaigas, bet galiausiai tenka kreiptis pagalbos ir į lordą Peterį Wimsey.Ko gera, labiausiai man patikusi serijos knyga. Penki iš penkių.
4032781770	ARGGHHHH WHY WAS THIS SO FREAKING AMAZING?????I mean. The setting! And Harriet! And the mystery which was mysterious! And academia! And philosophy! And Latin!!!! (The Latin at the end made me SO HAPPY.)Also. I adore Lord Saint-George. He is the best. But also, Lord Peter being like, "Here, come here and I'll strangle you so you can learn to get out of it." *dies* Also, the way he worries about Harriet SO MUCH but lets her do her thing because he LOVES her and knows that trying to keep her safe will drive her nuts, and <3 <3 <3 this is literally the most attractive thing I've seen in a LONG TIME. 4 stars, and probably higher on a reread!
8136477759	I’m doing GOOD at getting to books that have been on my TBR for seven bajillion years. Or at least better than usual.Anywho, this classic 1930s mystery set at Oxford was a big winner for me. Very fun and smart and romantic in the quietest ways. I loved it.
5957623455	New ship just dropped 🫶🏻🙌🏻
3900304894	This book has so much, and it's all things I've been wrestling with and mulling over: the world of academia vs. the outside world, the "real" world; men and women and roles; love that becomes possession and love that submits—love healthy and unhealthy and the thin line between; marriage and freedom and loneliness and desire; conflicting desires, the essence of being a woman (it feels); personal loyalty vs. adherence to an abstract and transcendent principle, to duty; and more. A perfect balance between mystery/suspense and characters' interior struggles/relationships. It's a book I'll keep coming back to. (I wouldn't recommend the audio, though, because the narrator I listened to didn't do a good job of distinguishing between voices and there are so many conversations in this book that it got hard to follow.) Also I love the epigrams and the Latin and the nerdy academic quotations being flying around.
6840521363	So beautifully British with names like Lord Gobbersleigh, Adrian Cloot, Tasker Hepplewater, Walton Strawberry, and Sneep Fortescue. 😍
2640091884	Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.Gaudy Night looks to be the chunkiest of Sayers’ novels on my bookshelf: in effect, it’s a book-length musing on women and education, on equality in a relationship, and in doing the thing that you’re best suited to do — and making the sacrifices that may entail. Although there’s another book after this, it’s really the culmination of the series in some ways, resolving the romance between Peter and Harriet, and finally bringing the two of them into balance.The plot itself takes Harriet to Oxford, a place she’s avoided since before she was tried for the murder of her lover. She didn’t think she could go back, after both taking a lover and being tried for his murder (even if she was acquitted), but she quickly finds there’s still a place for her there, and a life that has its charms of quiet contemplation and good hard work. She’s asked to stay there to help them track down something rather odd going on in their midst, a cross between a poison pen and a poltergeist, bent on causing disturbances that will reflect badly on the good name of the college — something that could be a pretty harsh blow to women’s education. In the meantime, she gets embroiled in various rivalries and misunderstandings, meets Peter’s nephew, and generally gets herself into trouble.Really, the mystery isn’t as important to this book as Harriet’s struggle to forgive herself, and to begin to trust again after what happened to her. Although it’s been some time since the trial, she hasn’t really been confronting the demons and letting the wounds heal, and this book makes her do so. It also makes her really look at Peter, and discover how she actually feels about him.It’s a book that dramatises badly: the BBC television adaptation is by far my least favourite of the three with Edward Petherbridge, despite the manifest delights of both him and Harriet Walter’s performance. The BBC radioplay is actually narrated by Harriet, and sticks much closer to the book, and so is more successful as a cohesive listening experience, though perhaps less so as a dramatisation. It’s a pretty insular book, and I think you may have to love Harriet, Peter, Oxford, or all of the above, to really appreciate it.I really do. The thing that excites me most about Harriet and Peter as a couple is the fact that from their first meeting, everything hinges on them becoming equals and seeing each other as such — this isn’t a relationship where either of them subordinates their own wishes. Both are fully formed people, and Peter wants it that way — and Harriet doesn’t know or believe that he does, instead believing that any relationship will involve the subjugation of one to the other. Her realisation is beautiful, and Peter’s patience with bringing her there likewise. I think that aspect of the books has aged well, even if the concern about educating women to a high level seems much less relevant.
492979161	Ok, so I have always said that Gaudy Night is my all-time favorite book with Byatt's Possession running a close second. I've read this book 10-12 times but had not read it for probably 10 years. I read it again this month because it is the September book selection for Modern Mrs. Darcy. It definitely pulled ahead to my all-time favorite. I read it slowly and savored it. Is this the first feminist novel? Some say that it is. I never thought of it as specifically being a feminist novel although I think she was daring for presenting the question of women in the academic world or working in then traditional mens' jobs as a question that had been asked and answered. Between that question, her relationship with Lord Peter, and her struggle to reconcile the events in her past, the story has many levels to it. This book is a great intellectual exercise. The references to other literature are fantastic and still keep me on my toes. It's a book that I never want to put down. I'm going to go back and re-read all the Wimsey-Vane novels now.
1836306597	This is my second Peter Wimsey book, and though this is considered the best by Dorothy L. Sayers, after reading the book I realised that I should have read a few preceding books as to get a clearer understanding of what's happening in his life. Fortunately enough, the book had very less of him and the protagonist was Harriet Vane, in the setting of Oxford. I loved Harriet Vane. After a point in the book, I wanted the mystery to be solved by her and was quite ready to forsake the protagonist of the series. She had the brains to do it, also she was interesting enough to not require anyone else's contribution to make the book good. For a change, this wasn't a murder mystery and it was a refreshing change. Let's leave it at that. As compared to the previous Wimsey book which I read (Whose Body?), I loved the writing in this one. I had many of the dialogues copied, because of the brilliance with which they were written. Though the philosophical parts became a tad too much.
4351032947	I loved the evocation of Oxford in the 1930s and on one level I enjoyed feeling part of an elite world. And yet, really I didn't. Harriet Vane is just too vain for me. I was put off right from the start: she agreed to attend Gaudy Night for the sake of an old friend who was suffering from a serious illness, possibly terminal. Instead of seeking to be a comfort and support to her 'friend', Vane can only see how the two have grown apart, she spends as little time as possible with her, and never mentions her again. Harriet is too much of a self-absorbed intellectual snob to deserve the adoration she inspires from the men in the novel. Her dilemma on whether to marry Wimsey or not was for me too fussy, self-centered and, yes, vain. The romance was drawn out over a too long novel, as were all the poltergeist incidents. Too many. On and on with not much progression.
1945775155	I am completely perplexed by all these positive reviews. I loathe this author. She seems such a haughty snob. She is clearly extremely intelligent and loves to show off her erudition but her writing is SO tedious and pretentious. The characters are parodies of the British upper class of yesteryear in their speech and behavior. I don't like them. I don't care about them. It's so dated, and not in a good way. Nothing happens. It just goes on and on and on ad nauseam. Pure torture. I say, what? I think I'll just toddle off and try a mystery by a different author. Agatha Christie, perhaps? Jolly good!
