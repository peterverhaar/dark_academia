147031934	This is my favourite book. I do not say that lightly - I've read quite a lot from all different genres - but this is my favourite book. Of all time. Ever. The ladies over at The Readventurer kindly allowed me to get my feelings of utter adoration for Wuthering Heights off my chest in their "Year of the Classics" feature, but I now realise it's time I posted a little something in this blank review space. I mean, come on, it's my favourite book so it deserves better than empty nothingness.So, what do I love so much about Wuthering Heights? Everything. Okay, maybe not. That wouldn't really be saying it strongly enough.What I love about this novel is the setting; the wilderness. This is not a story about niceties and upper class propriety. This is the tale of people who aren't so socially acceptable, who live away from the strict rules of civilization - it's almost as if they're not quite from the world we know. The isolation of the setting out on the Yorkshire moors between the fictional dwellings of The Heights and Thrushcross Grange emphasises how far removed these characters are from social norms, how unconventional they are, and how lonely they are.This is a novel for readers who can appreciate unlikeable characters; readers who don't have to like someone to achieve a certain level of understanding of them and their circumstances. People are not born evil... so what makes them that way? What torments a man so much that he refuses to believe he has any worth? What kind of person digs up the grave of their loved one so they can see them once again? Heathcliff was not created to be liked or to earn your forgiveness. Emily Brontë simply tells his story from the abusive and unloved childhood he endured, to his obsession with the only person alive who showed him any real kindness, to his adulthood as an angry, violent man who beats his wife and imprisons the younger Cathy in order to make her marry his son.It would be so easy to hate Heathcliff, and I don't feel that he is some dark, sexy hero like others often do. But I appreciate what Emily Brontë attempts to teach us about the cycle of violence and aggression. Heathcliff eventually becomes little more than the man he hates. By being brought up with beatings and anger he in turn unleashes it on everyone else. And Cathy is no delicate flower either. What hope did Heathcliff have when the only person he ever loved was so selfish and vindictive? But I love Emily Brontë for creating such imperfect, screwed-up characters.This is a dark novel that deals with some very complicated people, but I think in the end we are offered the possibility of peace and happiness through Cathy (younger) and Hareton's relationship, and the suggestion that Cathy (older) and Heathcliff were reunited in the afterlife. I had an English teacher in high school that said Cathy and Heathcliff's personalities and their relationship were too much for this world and that peace was only possible for them in the next. I have no idea if this was something Ms Bronte intended, but the romantic in me likes to imagine that it's true.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
1232992508	"Hello, everyone. Welcome to chaos." -Emily Brontë upon publishing this book, probablyInside me, there are two wolves. (I am saying there are two wolves in order to reference the meme, but what would be more accurate is to say that inside of me there are two boring and nonviolent creatures. Like a pigeon. Or an accountant.)One wolf, or whatever, has such a constant and undying need to share its opinion that it is currently ranked #1 on Goodreads for most annoying best reviewer. (Don't check if that's still true. I doubt it'll stick and it'll be awkward for all of us if it isn't.)The other wolf (slash what have you) thinks every other wolf (or entity of your choosing) has a better grasp of every concept on earth than it does, and that it should shut up for one second and let the other wolves talk, like seriously, Jesus Christ, be quiet already, oh my god.The latter wolf wants to let you know that there is a very interesting conversation on the topic of this book, its categorization as a love story, and its history in the comments of this review, and you should scroll down to read that instead.But the first wolf is going to keep talking up here anyway.Here is a list of facts about this book:- it was published in 1848- its author had a grand total of about 1 year of formal education- it was said author's debut and written while she was in her 20s- it contains barbaric characters, total disregard for etiquette, necrophilia (or intent to commit), the devil embodied in a man (who is also the main love interest), The Royal Tenenbaums-style incest, premarital friskiness by 19th century standards, violence, emotional abuse, cruelty, and enough gaslighting to maybe make TikTokers consider for one second how often they use that word.Kind of surprising, no?In spite of the fact that I was told one hundred thousand million times that this is not a love story, I was told TWO hundred thousand million times that it was. And honestly I went in expecting something like Agnes Grey: it's not a satisfying romance, but there's something there.I was not prepared for this.This is a very intense and stunning and beautifully written novel, and if I ever reread it I think I will like it more then.But no matter how hard I tried on this first read, my brain will always lump the Brontë sisters and Jane Austen together.And this wasn't even Jane Eyre-level. It would have given Austen war flashback style nightmares.Bottom line: We'll get em next time!-------------pre-reviewwell. that wasn't what i thought it would be.review to come / 3 or 3.5 stars-------------currently-reading updatesreadathons are all about binge-reading books you haven't been able to make yourself pick up ever until you're in a reading slump. this is my first time doing one but i'm pretty sure.clear your shit prompt one: a book in which somebody dies (just guessing but seems like it)follow my progress here-------------tbr reviewconfession time: i have now amassed 3 copies of this book, in the hope that one of them will suddenly inspire me to read it
8030020	Certain novels come to you with pre-packaged expectations. They just seem to be part of literature's collective unconscious, even if they are completely outside of your own cultural referents. I, for instance, who have no particular knowledge of--or great love for--romantic, Anglo-Gothic fiction, came to Wuthering Heights with the assumption that I was picking up a melancholy ghost story of thwarted, passionate love and eternal obsession. Obsession turned out to be only accurate part of this presumption. Having an image of Heathcliff and Cathy embracing Gone with the Wind -style on a windy moor ironed in my mind, I was almost completely unprepared for the hermetic, moribund, bleak, vengeful, perverse, and yes--obsessive--novel that this really is. Don Quixote is not about windmills and Wuthering Heights is not really a love story. Heathcliff and Cathy's love affair (if it can be called that) is a narcissistic ("I am Heathcliff!" Cathy exclaims at one point), possessive, and imminently cruel relationship predicated on self-denial and an obsessiveness that relies not on passion, but rather borders on hatred. They are selfish, violent, and contriving people who have borne their fair share of abuses (mostly Heathcliff in this respect) and in turn, feel no compunction about raining similar abuses on those who they find beneath them.Given this dynamic, it seems perhaps inevitable that these two characters would make not only themselves miserable, but everyone around them miserable--even after death. This is particularly easy to accomplish mainly because there are--with the exception of Mr. Lockwood, the tenant who rents a home from Heathcliff--no outside characters. Everyone in the novel (including the servants) is isolated, trapped between the same two homes, with the same two families, and have truly no chance of escaping any of the events and repercussions that occur.(One character makes a temporary escape, only to suffer all the more for it later.) More important, however, is the fact that Heathcliff and Cathy don't even need be present (although they usually are in some fashion) for their influences to be felt by the other characters. The sins of the father, are literally, inherited and distributed among the next generation. The children of Wuthering Heights are not only physical doubles of their parents (At least 3 characters look like Cathy, and one resembles Heathcliff), but they are also spiritual stand-ins. They must suffer for past transgressions, and they must find a way to make amends for them. All, I might add, without the particular benefit of ever having the full story, the context that might be necessary to actually change their circumstances. Misery, it seems, is inevitable. There is, of course, much more to be said about this novel. One could spend quite some time dissecting all the various repetitions and doublings, the narrative structure (the story is told by the housekeeper to the lodger who then writes it down as a diary entry), or the archetypal analogies and semi-biblical symbolism that seems to be implicit to every part of this story. The point being, I suppose, that while Wuthering Heights may not be the wistful romance one (or maybe just I) expected to be, it is a particularly satisfying one for all of its dark and layered surprises.
79823808	"all i care about in this goddamn life are me, my drums, and you"...if you don't know that quote, you're probably too young to be reading this and isn't it past your bedtime or shouldn't you be in school or something?but that quote, hyper-earnest cheese - that is romance. wuthering heights is something more dangerous than romance. it's one long protracted retaliation masquerading as passion. and goddamn do i love it. i can't believe i haven't reviewed it before - i mention this book in more than half of my reviews, i have a whole shelf devoted to its retellings, so why the delay?? but better late than never. no, it's not a perfect novel; it's a flawed structure revealing the actions of seriously flawed people. the framing device-within-a-framing-device? totally awkward. having nelly dean tell the story even though where was she for most of the action? totally wrong move, bronte; it makes the beginning such a slog to get through. but that's just stale loaf - the good stuff is all the meat in between. and oh, the meat... the swarthy stranger of mysterious origins being raised in a family of sheltered overmoist english mushrooms, all pale and rain-bloated, the running wild, two-souls-against-the-world adolescence...childhood indiscretions... vows and tantrums, bonding, unspoken promises, yes i will yes i will yes i will. oh, but wait, what's this??...it's blond and it's rich and it's whats expected of me. very well then. see ya, heathcliff...it's just textbook gothic from here on out: revenge-seduction, overheard conversations, mysterious disappearances, murdered puppies, swooning, vindictive child-rearing, death, ghosts, moors, phoar... but this to me, is a perfect love story, even though it's more like torture. the unattainable is always more romantic than the storybook. i don't like an uncomplicated ending, and a story is more impactful with nuanced characters, preferably heavily unlikeable throughout. (this is where i plug head-on - one of my favorite movies ever. do it.)this story just makes me feel good. and i'm well over my teenage fascination with the "bad boy"; i realized pretty quick that "bad boys" are usually pretty dumb. so i moved on to "emotionally disturbed", which is the same thing, really; plenty of drama, and they will leave you drunken "presents" on your lawn (road signs, carousel ponies..), but not complete burnouts, at least. but my teenaged dating pool is neither here nor there, the point is that heathcliff can be romanticized as this victim/villain without having to correspond to the ideal. it's about the level of passion, the size of the grand romantic gesture. devoting your life to destroying the people who kept you from your true love is an amazingly grand gesture.come to my blog!

2520640	I've tried it three times. I know people are obsessed with it. I hate everyone in the book - and I just can't care about a book where I actually hate the characters.And, sure, I get the interpretation that as terrible as Heathcliff and Cathy are, it's their love that redeems them, and isn't that romantic.No.

1654297517	This is a review I never imagined I’d write. This is a book I was convinced I’d love. I just have to face the facts, Emily is no Charlotte.I’m going to start with the positives. The characterisation of Heathcliff is incredibly strong. He is a man who is utterly tormented by the world. As a gypsy boy he is dark skinned and dark haired, and to the English this rough, almost wild, look makes him a ruffian. He stands up for himself, and bites back; thus, he is termed a monster. In a very, very, Frankenstein’s monster like sense, his perceived outer image begins to permeate his soul. Call a man a monster, and eventually he may start acting like one. “He’s not a rough diamond - a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic; he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man.”He is a very complex man, capable of great cruelty and kindness. The world has made him bitter, and in a way ruined him. He reaps revenge, but revenge always ends the same way; it doesn’t solve problems but creates more. So he becomes even more tormented, this time by his own actions. He is very Byronic, and by today’s standards a little bit of a bad boy. He has all the standard tropes of an anti-hero, one that becomes a figure that can be sympathised with and hated. He’s a very complex man. The Bronte’s were directly affected by Byron’s poetry. Rochester is Charlotte’s portrayal of a similar, albeit less vengeful, character. Love is the key torment in both works. Heathcliff has been rejected, as Rochester cannot open his heart because of his secret wife. But, rather that overcome his personal loss, and subject the world to his dark and broody personality, Heathcliff actually seeks to do others harm. He is a very sensitive man when it comes to his own emotions, though he lacks any real empathy. He does not care that he is creating more pain for others. He spends his life spreading more hate into the world. His only redeeming quality is his love for Catherine, but that doesn’t excuse his tyranny. He knows how nasty he is: "She abandoned [her home] under a delusion," he answered, "picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished." He's so self-centred: So I rather like his character, well not like but appreciate the complexity, though the novel’s structure itself was abysmal. I have quite a few problems with the narrative.Why is a servant telling us this story as she speaks to a visitor of her master’s house? Why are we hearing someone’s interpretation of the events rather than the events themselves? Why is it twenty years later in the form of an extremely long conversation? Why is the servant still actually working for Heathcliff? She would have left. Nobody would choose to work for such a man. It just doesn’t make a lot of sense. At times it felt like the credibility of the story was stretched to breaking point. Nelly (the servant) actually being in some of the scenes was almost laughable. Often it was followed by a terrible explanation attempting to justify her presence. It sounded very desperate to me. This leads perfectly on to my next point. Half way through the story (the start of volume ii) we are told that the conversation has ended. We then hear the visitor’s description of the servant’s narrative about Heathcliff’s life. I mean seriously? So there are three layers of storytelling. Isn’t that completely unnecessary and overcomplicated? Why not just have Heathcliff tell the story or at the very least have the servant tell the story from start to finish in one story arc with no time shifts. For me, it felt like Emily wrote herself into a corner with her choice of narrative and desperately tried to write herself out of it to the point of ridiculousness. How much of the story can we believe? How much bias is in the narratives?Then there was the dialogue overloads. Large parts of the novel were entirely conversational. The narration was minimalistic and bare. The only character whose thoughts we were privy to, again Nelly the servant, was completely irrelevant to the plot. Who cares about the servant’s emotion and reactions? This isn’t her story; thus, the dialogue was packed out to the point of unnaturalness to fit in the thoughts of characters whose minds we weren’t privy to. Simply put, the characters said things people wouldn’t realistically say in conversation. It was overflowing with emotions and private thoughts. It was awkward. I’m not talking about private conversations, those don’t happen as Nelly is awkwardly present for every single event, but announcements or decisions (that should be internal) announced to a group of people. This is why plays have asides and soliloquies. And this is why novels aren’t told from the perspective of a random servant. There is clearly a great story here. Plot wise the novel is wonderful. But the way in which Emily told her story was nothing short of disastrous. It felt like a wasted opportunity. I’m absolutely horrified at how poor it is. This novel needed to be taken apart, re-wrote, and put back together again. Perhaps then it would have been worthy of the story it failed to tell. I’ve never been so massively underwhelmed in such a blatant lack of skill in a canonised piece of literature, one that has immense critical reception.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________

214646267	When people say they don’t like books where the characters are all unlikable I think “hear me out: Wuthering Heights.” These people are all shit. But I hear you protest “but but, madam, consider if you will that they have reason to be from their past and their—“Oh I get it and agree, doesn’t make them not suck as people though. But what fun would a happy and content ghost be anyways? On the moors no less. I stand by it. And this book slaps. Em.B, you penned a real one.Phantoms sobbing through the night, a shitty guest telling your story based on the cleaning lady’s oddly verbatim retelling, a man more beast than man or so they say, a tale of love a tale of obsession a tale told through soaring statements of euphoric beauty. ‘Honest people don't hide their deeds,’ and this dishonest crew are gonna give you the most notorious tell-all of literary history. Shit will get real and hit the fan and you will love it. This is a classic for a reason. Heathcliff is an eternal little vindictive shit and can go fuck himself but of course I’m gonna read this story gripping the pages and frantically flipping as fast as me wee eyeballs can carry us. Read it. Do it, you’ll love it. Just do it already.Also, shoutout to Anne Carson's phenomenal poem/essay The Glass Essay which inspired me to revisit this book.
1853255698	A classic revenge story with two characters with bad temperaments...I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It's dark, it's pretty messed up and definitely not romantic (really people? I worry about you).
3314426504	A new tenant visits his lessee's grand home, the Wuthering Heights, only to find the most dysfunctional house he could imagine, from Master Heathcliff, down to the servants! On (finally) getting back to his lodgings he gets to hear the very dark history (recounted back to him over a number weeks) of the families that lived at Wuthering Heights and at his lodgings, The Grange. This book tells that story, a story of human savagery, artfully penned, taking on themes of gender equality, class, hypocrisy, selfishness, envy, and let's not forget, the frailty of the male ego. Emily Brontë's only finished novel caused a bit of a sensation when it was first published, and even today verges on being a tale of horror! I loved every single page of it, and spent an entire day wolfing it down. I had no idea that this work would be so readable and addictive. 9 out of 12, flaming Four Star read.2020 read
3821881978	Here’s my choice for flashback Saturday at the time of another Mercury retrograde! One of my all time favorite classics: Wuthering Heights.The readers of this unconventional, provocative masterpiece truly diverted in two sides: haters and true admirers. I’m one of the admirers because I always like to read about honest approach to the monsters wearing human furs in the real world. Catherine and Heathcliff are irritating, extremely selfish, destructive, illogical characters. They can be definite as threatening monsters. The claustrophobic, dark, agitating world building at Yorkshire moors: desolated, remote, freezing grassland reflects true beauty and ugliness at the same time ( like the reflection of its own habitants) combines with the dark souls of the characters and push you into depressive,intense, bleak world of them filled with grudge, hatred, resentment. Why a man turn into a monster? Abuse he endured throughout the years from his family can manipulate his mind and make him think he’s not worthy enough. His bottled up anger, growing inferiority complex, sadness pushed him so far to kill the last pieces of humanity left in his body. He turns into a violent man beating his wife, cursing to his faith, becoming more vindictive at each second, fueling himself with the pain of the others just like he suffered when he witnessed his soulmate chose to marry with someone else and deep inside he is still humiliated Gypsy orphan boy even though now he is rich and powerful man . But in the meantime the man is still capable to feel passionate love. Did his obsessive love feed his hatred and push him too far to plan his vindictive revenge? He’s not the only villain of the story, his true love Catherine is also selfish, vicious, filed with hatred. The anger inside of them darkens their souls. They slowly decay and turn into ruthless creatures who don’t carry any piece of empathy. Catherine and Heathcliff’s story was too intimidating, destructive, unconventional for 19th century of England but as far as I can see it’s still way too much complex, heartfelt, painful for the world we’re living in, too.Multi POVed storytelling technique and the heartbreaking, moving, extremely disturbing, dark, traumatic and truly tragic story of two most argumentative characters of the literature still haunt my soul but like a moth to a flame I cannot help myself to be drawn to this book over and over again. Here are my favorite quotes: “Do I want to live? . . . [W]ould you like to live with your soul in the grave?”“Be with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you!”“I’m tired of being enclosed here. I’m wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.”“He’s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.” “You loved me—then what right had you to leave me?”“I’m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.”“I have to remind myself to breathe—almost to remind my heart to beat!”
437221218	Cathy and Heathcliff, a love story? At the beginning of our narrative Mr. Lockwood a tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord Mr. Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights, four long miles away across the cold, eerie, moors, people back then walked a great distance they had few options without much complaining, troubled Lockwood wants to get away from society (he came to the right place). The setting is northern England 1801, in the Yorkshire Moors a vast, remote, desolate and gloomy grassland beautiful and ugly at the same time, a haunting locale. Lockwood is the only person who likes Heathcliff " a capital fellow" in the area, he sees something no one else does on his mournful face, sadness maybe even regret ( like himself) ? Later he learns the story of his landlord's tragic life, through Mrs. Nelly Dean his servant at Thrushcross Grange for three generations , she tells him about the life of Heathcliff found in the streets of Liverpool hungry , crying, dirty all alone without anyone caring there at the tender age of two, but the compassionate Mr. Earnshaw a wealthy man , Catherine's (Cathy's) father and takes him home. They never discovered the boy's true identity but because of the child's dark complexion, everyone calls him a gypsy. The two, Catherine and Heathcliff, grow up as brother and sister at Wuthering Heights always together Cathy and the unwanted orphan, playing on the lonely moors, they are soulmates . Resented by Cathy's older brother Hindley, (who beats him many times) in fact everyone does, still the gentle Mr. Earnshaw loves the boy. Morose, showing no emotions he can't afford to, still very angry underneath because of how others treat him, as an inferior, Heathcliff was never given another name. When teenager Cathy decides to marry Edgar Linton from a respected well off family and Heathcliff hears about it , he disappears to parts unknown the penniless man feels betrayed....Years pass and Heathcliff comes back from America rich, nobody learns how and he doesn't say either, probably not quite honestly and seeks vengeance. The children of each estate the Linton's of Thrushcross Grange and the Earnshaw's of Wuthering Heights, inherit their respective homes, Cathy wants to maintain a friendship and maybe more with Heathcliff, the weak Edgar of course hates the gypsy yet can't stop the two from seeing each other, the attraction is too powerful. The triangle will soon dissolve, people come and go but the moors abide. Strong novel with a bittersweet plot... Love or despise this classic, you cannot help but admire its quality.
2701290912	“People feel with their hearts, Ellen, and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him.” Okay, I know that Wuthering Heights is so many people’s favorite book of all-time, and so many people’s least favorite book of all-time, so I went into this not really knowing what to expect. I will be honest, I didn’t really love it, but I was for sure not expecting the wild ride that this story took me on. But this is a story set in 1801, about a man named Mr. Lockwood, staying the night at Wuthering Heights. He meets a man named Heathcliff, who seems absolutely miserable, and he meets a housekeeper named Ellen Dean who will eventually help us figure out why Heathcliff is so miserable. Oh, and when Lockwood goes to sleep that night, he is awoken by a ghost! He then tells Ellen this, and she promptly throws us back into a flashback, where she becomes the new narrator, and we get to see what went down at Wuthering Heights many years ago. Wuthering Heights, to me, is a story all about abuse, and cycles of abuse, and how abuse can impact so many hearts and so many generations repeatedly. Abuse and cruelty truly breed violence, and Heathcliff and everyone he has been forced to interact with just showcase that theme over and over. Heathcliff was orphaned and taken in, but everyone reminds him that he constantly is an outsider. But this story focuses on him and the three young people he grew up alongside of, and they are all shitty in their own ways. ➽ Heathcliff is shitty because he only cares for Catherine. ➽ Isabelle is shitty because she only cares about Heathcliff. ➽ Edgar is shitty because he doesn’t care about his sister. ➽ Catherine is shitty because she only cares about herself. “Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.” And friends, it is a truly wild ride seeing these characters interact with one another. And we eventually get to see their children who (you guessed it) are shitty, too! Again, cycles of abandonment and abuse is truly heartbreaking in every aspect. I don’t want to say too much more without spoiling, because I really do think the twists are pretty decent in this and figuring out more about the ghost was a big highlight for me. Also, the atmosphere was phenomenal, and the Yorkshire moors truly set a beautiful stage for this dark tale. And I feel like this is a little bit of an unpopular opinion; but I actually really liked Emily’s prose, too. I do want to say that upon finishing this story, I immediately started to look up things about the entire Brontë family, and my heart just broke. The things that those sister, and their entire family, had to go through. I know 2019 is kind of a dumpster fire, but I am so thankful that I wasn’t born in the 1800s, good Lord. Also, reading about how closely tuberculosis impacted this story and Emily’s life truly was so sad. Seriously, I have so much love and respect in my heart for these three sisters, originally writing their dark tales under male pseudonyms, who will now never be forgotten. Overall, even though I didn’t love this story, this book was enjoyable enough to read. But you’re never going to find me romanticism anything that Heathcliff did. But I truly couldn’t wait to find out what happened next to all these insufferable characters. And I still firmly believe that Ellen/Nelly deserves the entire world. Also, I had the biggest giggle while reading about someone throwing hot applesauce at someone else, because like, just imagine that.

102045	I first read this in AP English Literature - senior year of high school. This book is dense and thick and confusing, and with a class full of haters, it was hard to wrap my head around it. I subsequently read it three or four more times for classes in college and every time I read it, I loved it more. I always found some new, fascinating piece of the story I had never picked up on.The last time I read it, I suddenly realized that there were many hints and clues that Heathcliff could, in fact, be black. A quick shot at research into Liverpool, where Mr. Earnshaw found the urchin, shows that it was the home to a thriving slave trade. This theory completely changes the story, in my opinion.Or the thought someone brought up in our seminar on the Brontes - what if Nellie is in love with Heathcliff and subsequently altered how she told the story? You do find Nellie to be coincidently involved in many key scenes throughout the text. What if she isn't the good guy most readers assume she is?Wuthering Heights is one of the quintessential novels in history. There's nothing else you can really say about it, except that it's one of the best pieces of writing to ever be created. It's just that incredible.Finished for the 5th time - 11/25/2014
4811060524	Wuthering Heights is a story of great love and passion. It is a story of betrayal. It is a story of revenge. It is a story of complicated relationships in and between families. It is a story of rebels. It is a story of a few selfish characters who will try to do anything for their benefit. This is the beauty of this novel. It can be viewed from multiple angles, and we can see many embedded themes in it, giving us a different reading experience every time we read it in various phases of our life. Emily Bronte has crafted this story in such a way that the story of the Earnshaws and the Lintons and Heathcliff and Catherine will stay in our minds forever. If you are a lover of classics, this is unequivocally the book you should never miss. “If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.”
2742513968	My first re-read*This story is still one of a kind! First read (November 2019)*This book is truly one of a kind! I have never read a book so full of dislikable characters, but still feeling so attached to them at the same time. I am in awe of the Brontë sisters and can't wait to keep reading more of their work. Few books make me feel as if the setting is its own character, and Wuthering Heights is definitely its own entity. I could feel her descriptions in my bones! The cold harsh rain storms that overpower the Moors, the vast hills and twisting trees!! It was an incredible reading experience, and now I am so excited to delve deeper into Emily Brontë's poetry since this is unfortunately her only novel! Yet, what a novel it is!! 🍁🍂
7899503819	A man who is absolutely not white falls in love with a woman who is almost definitely his half-sister and that’s the most normal thing that happens in the book. A cautionary tale of what a bad idea marrying the only other person you know is, Wuthering Heights is sometimes regarded as an epic romantic tragedy but I think it’s a bunch of abused people who are both in desperate need of therapy to break the pattern of generational trauma they are entrenched in and also deep in the throes of drama-queendom. The heroine dies halfway through because she literally can’t stand to not pull focus for five seconds, and the oft-quoted line “whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same” is accurate except “souls” is DNA because those two are RELATED, BRO. Anyway it was great frolicking on the moors with a bunch of emotionally stunted psychopaths.
7270951505	Wuthering Heights is basically a story about everything falling apart.Spoilers Ahead!Heathcliff and Catherine were childhood soulmates - inseparable and deeply in love. But Catherine’s brother, Hindley, treated Heathcliff cruelly and d tore them apart. Eventually, Catherine married Edgar Linton - a wealthy, refined man - despite loving Heathcliff. She later died giving birth to her daughter. Heartbroken and furious, Heathcliff spent the next 20 years seeking revenge: he ruined Hindley and Edgar, took over their estates, trapped their children in a hellish version of Wuthering Heights, and even dug up Catherine’s grave to keep her close - making sure Edgar would never share a tomb with her, even after death.I honestly believe that anyone who’s ever been in a relationship could never write something like Wuthering Heights. It paints an idealized picture of love that blows both love and hate way out of proportion - something that rarely happens in real life.In reality, love and hate don’t really last.You just can’t keep fighting with yourself forever; whether you choose love or hate, you end up hurting yourself the most. The stronger your feelings get, the more they wear you down, and keeping things balanced takes a willpower most people simply don’t have.We’re all scared of pain and exhaustion, so we eventually forget old flames and let past grudges fade away. In the end, the only thing that sticks around is life itself - eating, sleeping, getting around, and the basic needs of being human.Luckily, the Bronte sister never got married or truly fell in love. She didn’t have to learn life’s tough lessons, never experienced the searing pain of loss, and didn’t get a taste of how our bodies heal with scars and calluses. She didn’t know that making peace with life is the only way to survive. And that’s why Wuthering Heights turned out so extreme, idealistic, and fiercely loyal - not just to love, but also to hate. It isn’t afraid of pain because it never really knew what pain was.While reading, I kept asking myself: is tragedy really unavoidable? If Hindley and Edgar’s fates are doomed by Heathcliff’s wild, stormy need for revenge, then what about Isabella and young Catherine? They willingly drop into a personal hell - not out of bravery, but out of sheer weakness, afraid of a painful, bloody breakup. They stick it out for years until they have nothing left to lose.I remember back when I was a teenager, my then-girlfriend (now my wife) and I agreed on 1 thing: if either of us ever cheated, we’d get divorced without a second thought. Now, when this topic comes up in our group chats - especially when friends or family members are involved in cheating - no one seems absolutely sure what advice to give. The truth is, until you really face that moment, you can’t know for sure. We’re all human who’ve learned hard lessons from life.The more I live, the more I find myself moving away from my old stance - divorce is now the very last option. Not because I’m immoral or anything, but because we’re just human.All the things people criticize - cheating, affairs, one-night stands - can often be explained by emotional needs. We’re only human; we make mistakes, and at our core, we’re just animals wearing a mask. I understand that sometimes we’re not really in control of our feelings or actions, even when they seem senselessly wild. But as for me, I’d never let myself get stuck in that mess - not even for a second. I’m too old for that.But there’s this ridiculous idea called “sunk cost.” A lot of lifelong misery comes from it - sticking with a relationship because you’ve been together so long, not wanting to break up even if it’s obvious it’s over; being tangled up financially so you can’t easily walk away; or staying together for the sake of the kids. Then you see how it goes: the cheater cheats over and over, and the betrayed 1 keeps getting hurt. Instead of recouping what you’ve invested, you lose more and more. Lovers stop cherishing you, and a partner might only care about just showing up. Damn this life - every minute feels like hell.Some people, even when they’re being taken to the execution grounds, still manage to show a bit of class - offering the executioner money and asking him to sharpen his blade. But most of us end up stuck with a dull knife, suffering endless, hopeless cuts.I’m married, yet I still think that while being with someone is great, being alone isn’t so bad either. What really scares me is when 2 people together end up living a life that’s worse than living alone. In such a trap, those who stay in a bad relationship just keep sinking deeper. Honestly, if it comes to that as a last resort, I’d rather take a sharp knife and cut out all the rotten parts completely - even if it hurts - so that life can eventually get better. At our age, what matters most is simply enjoying our daily meals; if that’s not satisfying, then all the fancy things in the world don’t mean much.What does it mean to forgive? It’s like having the ultimate power in your hands - a “Death Note” that could override even the law - but choosing to hold back, to not write someone’s name down for hate. That’s forgiveness.Having the power to punish but choosing not to is what real forgiveness is all about.The magic of this novel is that Heathcliff never forgives anyone - even as he nears the end. He never makes peace with his hate or with fate; he’s like a wild wind blowing across a barren land - fierce and unyielding - until 1 day, when his enemies are completely wiped out, he loses the thrill of revenge and finally finds some sort of peace in death.That’s also what makes this classic so much more fascinating than Jane Eyre. Jane Eyre is all about reason and self-control, where the heroine smartly finds the “right” path in a confusing world and calmly edges closer to God. This novel, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. It doesn’t follow any logical rules or conform to society’s norms. It’s rough, blunt, and wild. In it, love and hate are all that really matter; not even God is needed.1 story is about gaining everything, and the other is about tearing everything down.That’s the real charm of literature.4.4 / 5 stars
2313410910	"Treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies."Thrushcross Grange is a quiet, unassuming place and at first, Mr. Lockwood thinks he's found a great place to leave. However, when he visits his landlord (Heathcliff) at Wuthering Heights, Mr. Lockwood begins to feel uneasy.Everyone in that farmhouse seems off-putting - sullen and unfriendly. Mr. Lockwood is forced to stay the night and after a horrendous nightmare, decided to return home the next morning regardless of the weather.He soon regrets that choice for upon returning to Thrushcross Grange, he becomes ill and falls bedridden. Given that there isn't much to do, the housekeeper (Nelly) begins to weave a strange tale that she witnessed decades before.Thirty years ago, the Earnshaws lived at Wuthering Heights with their children Hindley and Catherine. One day, Mr. Earnshaw returns from a trip with a orphan (Heathcliff). Mr. Earnshaw treats Healthcliff far better than his biological children, causing much resentment from Hindley. Upon Mr. Earnshaw's passing, Hindley inherits Wuthering Heights, and decides to make Heathcliff's life a living hell."Honest people don't hide their deeds."Yet despite the abuse, Catherine falls for Heathcliff. Yet Heathcliff's low status and simmering resentment leaves much to be desired - but Catherine cannot help herself...and nor can Heathcliff."He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."This book was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. She was awful. He was terrible. And yet... I could not turn away. Just something about this is just so wholly fascinating. The wildness of the Moors, the crushing weight of society, the way the characters stood tall despite the horrendous conditions...and the way they succumbed when they could no longer resist.This is one of the classic books that I truly feel like I understand the fascination. I want to read it over and over.Audiobook CommentsExtremely well-read. An absolute delight!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
858314745	Wuthering Heights takes us to a world that is somehow outside of all social and moral norms. It's closer to the realm of dreams or Greek myth than the rational everyday life of civilised habit. As if the characters are dramatizing the psyche or the unconscious in the midst of everyday life. Bronte demands we extend our sympathies beyond their brightly-lit habitual moral parameters - rather like Nabokov does in Lolita. Except where Nabokov does it directly through his narrator Bronte is arguably cleverer by providing us with a rather commonplace and reasonable narrator who much more mirrors our own sensibility. Nelly is like a comfortable armchair. You might say the norm in this novel is sociopathic behaviour and yet Nelly with her commonplace emotional economies provides the illusion that everything she recounts is firmly attached to a normal social reality. It's a super clever sleight of hand on Bronte's part. Thus this is a conventional secular narrative we experience in Nelly's armchair about a violent amoral world in which almost everything is outside the realm of civilised etiquette. Structurally this book is a brilliant enigma. It feels like a series of unconscious decisions on Emily's part which for a novel that spends a lot of time dramatizing the darker realms of the human psyche is another masterstroke. Our narrator is almost immediately shoved aside by a first-hand witness of all events, Nelly, the housekeeper. Bronte uses this technique of doubling up throughout the novel - eventually Catherine and Heathcliff's children will replace Catherine and Heathcliff. Virtually every character in this novel has a twin. At times it's confusing trying to recall who is whose offspring or relative but this only adds to the novel's atmosphere of some kind of elemental drama unfolding in which individuals are no less cyclical, no less driven by primitive energies than the surrounding moors. Wuthering Heights is an adventure into the heart of darkness, anticipating Conrad by more than fifty years. It's also a novel that feels spookily intimate with death. To anyone who thinks this a dated novel which belongs fixedly to its time I'd say there are thousands and thousands of modern day Heathcliffs doing time in our prisons and wreaking havoc on our streets, deprived, racially abused, unloved kids who have made it their mission to exact revenge on a cruel pitiless world. This is a way more subtle and far reaching portrait of the plight of the abused child than anything her sister came up with. Jane Eyre is corporate American cinema compared to Heathcliff. Bronte does more than give a voice to the emotionally crippled, the inarticulate, the vindictive outcasts of society; she creates the world they would like to live in, the destruction of virtually everything we associate with civilised society. And shows us too, by eventually civilising Catherine and Heathcliff's respective children, that we all have elements of Heathcliff and Catherine buried down in our psyches which occasionally make an unsettling appearance in our daily life.
5208333351	First book for 2023, and it’s a classic, gothic fiction. My first read by a Brontë sister since reading 'Jane Eyre'.First and only novel by Emily Brontë.Second buddy read with Marge Moen: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2...And I can't wait to read Marge's insights. Emily is one of the three Brontë sisters who initially needed to publish their novels under male pseudonyms - I think that spells volumes about their writing on repression and societal norms of the time. I can understand why people either love or hate ‘Wuthering Heights’, or are the very least perplexed by it. This is not an easy, pleasant read. And that's probably its appeal for me. I sit firmly in the 'love' camp. So much meanness, violence, ugliness. So many characters suffer from fragile health. Such contrast between strong (aggressive) and weak (sickly) characters.Revenge is a major aspect of the apparent tortured love storyline. How else can it be described, but a kind of warped love story? It is dark, broody and harsh, at times excruciatingly cruel. How did Emily Brontë think up these characters and themes? Surely she drew from some of her own experiences? I must do some post-read research. A few takeaways =My expectations were met.I also responded well to the symbolism: ‘Catherine’s face was just like the landscape - shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more transient…’Ellen, the devoted, long term nanny, maid-come-servant endured so much. Too much.The old religious-fanatic Joseph, another servant who also suffered through generations of the main characters, spoke in a Yorkshire dialect. Brontë was clever to capture this, but I couldn’t understand a lot of it. I fear I’ve missed some important plot details. Maybe there’s an edition with a translation as footnotes? At times, I got a little confused who was who. Brontë invariably switches from Christian names to titles or surnames, and gives offspring the same names as their parents or relatives. Ah, now I’m nitpicking, and I didn’t want to do that! I was a little bewildered how Heathcliff, the male anti-hero, turned out so badly. I wanted to like him more. Then again, I’m glad Brontë didn’t give us stereotypical characters. Maybe I would have been critical if Heathcliff turned out to be all lovey-dovey?See what this novel has done to me? I’m babbling. Kate Bush’s hit by the same name makes a lot more sense to me now. An expected 5-star rating just falls short, but that's not to say I didn't love it!4.5 stars from me.I thought about that trick of raising it to 5 stars, but then thought no, that doesn't paint the right picture.Ah, still babbling thanks to Cathy and Heathcliff...
928999786	SPOILERSBehold the wild, dark side of love. “I am Heathcliff – he’s always, always in my mind – not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself – but as my own being.” Passion. Desire. Love. Are they the same thing? If we are so intoxicated by someone as ending up seeing them as a mirror to our own self, is this love? It is. Sometimes. But sometimes it is sign not of devotion, but of egotism so strong that it stops us from seeing the actual person and we imagine a likeness that isn’t there just in order to fulfill our needs. I believe that Catherine loves Heathcliff, but I don’t believe she understands him or desires to. By believing he would agree to her plan she shows how little she takes into account what he actually is. She is so lost in her passion that she isn’t willing to admit the difference between them. It is a dangerous thing to be so absorbed by passion for someone that you don’t even care to understand and accept them for who they are. You just want to own them. By making the choice of marrying another man and keeping Heathcliff by her side as a lover whom she would support with her husband’s money she gives up on the very thing that has connected them so far, on the very thing that has stood at the core of their love. Freedom. They both grow up as captives of society that does not understand and accept them for who they are. He is the only one in front of whom she can be herself and she is the only one in front of whom he can be himself. But by choosing to dissemble and submit, Catherine loses that spark that initially connects them. She believes it is for their own good. He is heartbroken. When he comes back, he spends so much time and energy trying to bring back a girl who no longer exists. He cannot stand the woman she has turned herself into. In this case, is he still in love with her or merely in the memory of her? When the person we have loved loses the part that has held our affections, when should we give up on them and when should we devote ourselves to restoring that part? "He’s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same." Their tragedy lies exactly in the fact that they are not the same. He wants freedom, she wants security. Benjamin Franklin says 'Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.' I neither agree, nor disagree. I believe it is a very subjective matter. It isn’t that simple. But in the case of Catherine it really does turn out this way. In the end she has neither comfort, nor freedom.How much do we know those who we claim to love? We all risk to see something that isn’t actually there or miss something that is. Either blinded by passion or by our desire to recreate the objects of our passion. If we cannot truly accept our loved ones for who they are and we try to change them, then do we truly love them or simply those we would like them to be? Can such a distinction be made? Or is it a little bit of both? Do we love only those parts of our partners that resemble ourselves or are we willing to love even those we cannot accept? Are love and acceptance the same thing? It isn’t uncommon for a person to try changing their loved one, but sometimes the good and the bad come from the same place and if we happen to succeed, we are at risk of destroying the good as well. Catherine tries to tame Heathcliff and in doing so, she destroys him. His passionate love turns into passionate hatred.Feeling so close to someone as not to know where you end and they begin is either a sign of profound affinity or a profound delusion. Love is merciful and cruel, generous and selfish, sorrow and ecstasy. We all lose something and gain something by choosing to give into another person. Change is inevitable. Sometimes we get stronger, sometimes we are ruined. Sometimes it is a little bit of both. Some of us find their worthy partners, some, sadly, never do. But I believe that no matter on which side of the coin you turn out, staying faithful to yourself is always the right choice.Read count: 2

The reason this has remained such a firm favourite, and why I try to ensure I reread this at least biennially, however, is that in this intense and focused character study I found myself unaccountably and entirely drawn to every unlikable individual in it. I forgave every flaw and overlooked any ordinarily dislikeable quality in my blind adoration for these passionate creatures.I was captivated by the raging emotions that dominated, throughout. The wildness of the characters and their uncontrollable fits of frenzy and passion - their deepest of despairs and their most ardent of desires - is also mirrored by the wildness of the landscape surrounding them, creating an eternal and external, extra character in this most infamous of love triangles.I have reread this so often that I could probably quote every single page, but yet I never fail to find something new to discover on the moors. There is a feeling of never quite being on equal footing that dominates and permeates the entire text. This is a novel that distances the reader: it denies any simple pleasure such as happy-ever-afters or a brief respite from the altering high passions and utter, all-consuming bleakness. I will never feel at home here but I will always long to.This has remained my favourite book from first reading until now, ten years later, and I think there's no better endorsement for a book than that!
93739162	Believe it or not, not a fan.The story itself is unique & very original, a precursor for many Victorian thrillers & haunted house spectaculars. But there was no engine in my brain to ease down the process; reading this is like reading something that is altogether mandatory. I guess its a classic because enough people have read it to distinguish it from better books.The character of Heathcliff is a vampire who sucks the life out of everyone in the household at Wuthering Heights & its neighbors. No doubt a good actor could play the hell out of him & get the Oscar. The work is labyrinthine & sometimes just too difficult to understand. It has incredibly unbeautiful sentences (really!) & is altogether irregular, shapeless-- not a pleasure at all.This, "Catcher in the Rye" and "On the Road" need to vacate the canon!

4150923932	Are you into edgy gothic British novels from the 18th century? Emily Brontë’s your girl. Her one and only novel, Wuthering Heights, holds themes of family grudges, revenge, unrequited love, as well as blunt language.Back in high school when I first started really digging in deep with classic books and discussing them in class etc. I was always drawn towards the Brontë sisters stories and they hold a special place in my heart. ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ ಇ. 𝓑𝓻𝓲𝓮𝓯 𝓞𝓿𝓮𝓻𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀 ་༘࿐ ‧₊˚ ⋅ .The contents of this novel caused quite a stir in Victorian society due to its tainted themes and morally unattractive characters. Some time has passed since all the conservatives reprimanded the novel, and it is now appraised as a work of literary art. Despite it being roughly 177 years since the publication of the novel, the behavior of these characters continue to stump readers and scholars.The story is set in the late 1700 and early 1800 Yorkshire moors. It revolves around two families living in the fictional estates of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange – The Earnshaws and The Lintons.Two families completely secluded and isolated from the traditional rules of civilization. These families are connected by love so fierce and harsh it will leave one of them dead and cast a shadow over the lives of their children.•*⁀➷ This Bronte novel might not be for everyone; you’ll either come to love it with all your being or hate it in the same way. There is no in-between. But what Bronte has accomplished is no simple task.With this story of Wuthering Heights, she destroyed all unrealistic expectations of relationships. She showed the world that love could be obsessive and obstructive like two entwined vines covered in thorns hurting everything around it.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ ಇ.

Bronte has written the characters as selfish, violent, and contriving people who have suffered their share of abuses (Heathcliff more than others) that they have no compunction about raining similar abuses on to the people they think are beneath them.Given this dynamic, they have not only accomplished to make their own lives miserable but also everyone else’s. They need not even be present for their influence to affect others adversely.

This is no lovey-dovey feel-good story. Wuthering Heights shows the harsh nature of people without veiling anything to make the reader feel good. Instead, it will leave you hurt and craving for the redemption of these characters.The writing is so powerful that it has made me want to throw the book across the room every time Heathcliff feels bad and takes his anger out on his fellow residents. But at the same time, it has me feeling sorry for him and other characters and hope with every part of my book-loving self that he redeems himself and turns over a new leaf. Every death, every birth, every small sliver of happiness the characters feel, everything they are made to endure by the wonderful penmanship of Emily Bronte takes my breath away in ways I didn’t even know existed.•*⁀➷ Wuthering Heights is truly a literary masterpiece. Emily Brontë’s work challenged the Victorian practices of that era, as well as the patriarchal practices. I personally believe she would have experienced even more disdain from reviewers and the community if she revealed her true identity, which is the sad truth. The novel was most definitely ahead of its time in terms of cultural customs and social etiquette. I think any avid reader should take up the challenge of reading this classic novel.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ ಇ.

2481696322	Me resulta increíble haber estado tantos años retrasando esta lectura. Por miedo, básicamente. Tenía tantas ideas preconcebidas sobre lo que me iba a encontrar con las Brönte, que no me atrevía. Hubo una época en la que pensaba, incluso, que Cumbres Borrascosas era una novela romántica. Maldita ignorancia.Una de las primeras cosas que impactan de la novela es el tono tétrico. Las descripciones sobre Cumbres Borrascosas y su recorrido hasta la granja de los Tordos serán imposible de olvidar. Al igual que sus personajes. Cosa curiosa porque la gran mayoría de sus personajes resultan extremadamente desagradables. Prácticamente todos. Pero aún así, consiguen que te intereses por cada uno de ellos y leas este libro sin parar. La lectura es adictiva y claustrofóbica a partes iguales. Ansioso estuve, incluso.Creo que pocos personajes he visto tan crueles en la literatura como Heathcliff. Es curioso que cuando era peque su nombre me hacía identificarlo con galan de películas románticas. Catherine tampoco se queda atrás. No llega al nível de crueldad de é, pero eran tal para cual. No voy a entrar en detalles de la trama, porque no es necesario. Y para quien conozca poco de la historia, como era mi caso, le recomiendo que siga siendo así hasta que lo lea. Cuanto más a ciegas vaya, más se sorprenderá y más maravillado acabará. Y si hay algo que sigue flipándome es pensar que Emily Brönte escribió esto. Una mujer, que por lo poco que sé, era extremadamente introvertida y vivía apartada de la sociedad al cobijo de sus hermanas y su hogar. Una mujer así fue capaz de escribir una historia con tanta profundidad y personajes tan ricos. Pareciera una mujer de 80 años que hubiera vivido una vida excitante. En fin, solo me queda unirme a ese gran pesar de todas las personas que han caído en las redes de Emily Brönte. ¿Por qué la vida no le dejó escribir más novelas? Vida llévate las novelas de 50 sombras y las de After y traenos más historias de Emily.Anne es tu turno :)
2106351196	5 stars ★convincing you to read this book based on some of my favourite lines from it: “He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.” “If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.” “If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.” “I have not broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine.” “I have dreamt in my life, dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas; they have gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the color of my mind." “I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death; and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen, and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him.” “If you ever looked at me once with what I know is in you, I would be your slave.” “I have to remind myself to breathe -- almost to remind my heart to beat!” “It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands,' he answered. 'Kiss me again; and don’t let me see your eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love my murderer—but yours! How can I?” “You know that I could as soon forget you as my existence!” “My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Healthcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.” And the one the ended up defining my entire being and makes me feel like i'm standing at the top of a mountain with wind blowing in my hair: “I wish I were a girl again, half-savage and hardy, and free.” And the one that breaks me every single time: “Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living. You said I killed you--haunt me then. The murdered do haunt their murderers. I believe--I know that ghosts have wandered the earth. Be with me always--take any form--drive me mad. Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! It is unutterable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!” like??? EMILY BRONTE? MA'AM? WHO WRITES LIKE THIS? 😭✋🏻 her words have changed my brain chemistry forever.
1284814666	Un libro de literatura clásica tal cual: historia de amor, largo y denso para leer.Quiero destacar un punto en particular que me encantó de este libro y que, en mi opinión, lo hace distinto a los demás. Emily describe todo lo que el amor conlleva en sí a través de Mr. Heathcliff. Muchas veces se dice que el amor es lindo y todo eso, pero aquí, si bien él era un ser bastante malo, en todo sentido, lo hizo por amor. Y ahí viene la gran pregunta ¿Cómo se puede describir el amor? Pregunta difícil.Mucha gente no entiende cuando alguien se obsesiona por amor, y ese amor no sólo se trata hacia una persona, sino que también se trata de lo que uno logra en la vida a partir de la meta que tiene cada uno, ya sea el amor de un hombre a una mujer, una mujer a un hombre, el amor a una mascota, a una casa, a sus tierras, al dinero, a lo que sea, pero amor al fin y al cabo.En mi experiencia leyendo el libro, debo decir que hubo algunas parte que me costó entender y tuve que hacerlo más de una vez, pero lo volvía a hacer con placer, ya que no me aburría. Poco a poco la historia se vuelve más interesante... sobre todo en el final, en el cual se aclara todo y es mucho más fácil y liviano de entender, en mi opinión.
175447902	I hated everyone. I mean how can you like anyone in this novel? People say Nelly Dean is a nice character but we don't know anything about her past! She is the most unreliable narrator in the history of fiction! I've heard people say this is a love story. Well, I don't think they actually read this novel. If tormented souls literally digging up corpses of loved ones is your idea of love then you are probably Dexter or someone. I don't even know how to review this. Near the end I had to take it chapter by chapter. It was SO depressing I couldn't even stand it! I read a chapter, then watched Clueless, read a chapter, then watched Labyrinth, read a chapter, then watched Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, I needed to flush each chapter out with teen comedies! DO NOT read this book if you are in any way depressed or sad about something because it will drive you mental and you'll end up like Heathcliff. Even though I hated everyone and everything was so depressing, I still loved it. It's not up there with her sister's work "Jane Eyre" but it's not as boring as "Pride and Prejudice".
4532022211	“you said i killed you—haunt me, then! be with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where i cannot find you!” emily bronte had no right to make this book so good.wuthering is not a romance (no matter how many times stephenie meyer tried to tell us otherwise in the twilight saga), but it is a love story, albeit a very distorted one. brontë's erudite demand of the english language shines through as she weaves poetry within her prose to create one of the most devastating, emotionally complex stories of all time.this book should not be read as a romance, but rather a story of deeply complicated and unlikeable characters and their relationships. brontë uses them as vehicles to explore the boundaries and intersections between infatuation, love, and lust. unlike most classics and books, she does not shy away from thoroughly depicting some of the most monstrous characters in literature—what they love, what they hate, how they love, how they hate.that in itself is a literary triumph and feat. "if all else perished, and he remained, i should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger." ⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻ mini review i originally had this at 3 stars when i read this almost ten years ago but i am bumping it up to 5.i fear this may be the best brönte... so sorry charlotte.

2961256709	- "كل ساقٍ سيسقى بما سقى"، لم يبارحني هذا القول معظم الرواية، مثل طيف "كاثرين" الذي لازم "هيثكليف" :)- من الروايات القليلة المربكة على صعيد الشعور، فالصراحة لم اعرف اذا كنت قد احببتها او كنت قد كرهتها! فمن جهة تعاطفت مع "هيثكليف" في البداية لما يعانيه من يتم، ومعاملة سيئة، وتنمّر ابن صاحب البيت وفي النهاية احتقرته واشمأزت نفسي منه ومن افعاله! كذلك كاثرين فقد راق لي عطفها على الغريب بدايةً، وكرهت انانيتها وتسلطها وغرورها لاحقاً وهذا يسري على جميع الشخصيات تقريباً.- من ناحية البناء، نحن نتكلم عن رواية تقّصها علينا خادمة، ورغم ان الخدم يطلعون على معظم الأحداث التي تجري في بيوت مخدوميهم، الا ان هذه المعرفة تبقى ظاهرية وسطحية، من هنا كانت الشخصيات قريبة الى التسطيح، والسذاجة لا بل مثيرة للشفقة في العديد من الأماكن! لو ان الرواية كانت على لسان "هيثكليف" كانت لتكون اعمق بكثير (وهذا من وجهة نظري).- وتدور الدوائر، فلسفة القصة دائرية، عودة على بدء في كل شيئ، القصة التي ابتدأت بالقلب الناصع العطوف لوالد كاثرين انتهت بذات القلب الأبيض لأحفاده! وما بينهما كان الموت والسواد والإنتقام، والمصادفة العجيبة ان هذا الموت تجسّد في شخصٍ أسود! شممت العبير الإنكليزي ههنا!!- الحبكة الدينامكية المستعملة كانت ممتازة لوقت كتابة الرواية، لكن ذروة الرواية بعودة "هيثكليف" وبدء الإنتقام كانت ضعيفة وضبابية، خصوصاً ان التغيير الذي حصل له بقي مجهولاً ولم اقتنع بنوعية التغيير في زمن قصير! كما ان التصوير الشيطاني لهيثكليف كان مبالغاً به خصوصاً في تعاطيه مع ابنه ومع ابنة حبيبته المفترضة ومعشوقته الأرضية!- الرسالة التي ارادتها الكاتبة بتغليب الحب على الأنانية كانت ممتازة في نهاية القصة خصوصاً ان قصة حب "كاثي" مع ابن خالها هي اعادة لقصة حب "هيثكليف" مع "كاثرين" لكن كاثي لم تتمادى في انانيتها وسخريتها بل اخذت على عاتقها تعليم ابن خالها ونجحت في كسبه. وكل ما حاول "هيثكليف" فعله طوال عشرين سنة ذهب ادراج الرياح.- الترجمة كانت جيدة، هناك مشكلة بسيطة في الطباعة فالأسطر جدّ قريبة من بعضها!
1792370048	Misery, duplicity, revenge, unhealthy family relationships - Wuthering Heights has it all!Whenever I hear the name Brontë, I start thinking about classic books, with ladies and gentlemen courting each other . . . but, I guess I need to stop confusing Brontë with Austin.This book is brutal. Every page is an argument, a dark plot, a deathly ill character, or an actual death. There is no joy in Wuthering Heights!Writing wise, it was pretty good. Not my usual style, but I like to knock out a classic every now and then.
5159325525	As a youngster this book mystified me. Adults said I should read it so I did my best. Later, teachers said I should read it, so I read it again. Then it cropped up on a syllabus and got a third and fourth run through. I even watched the movie. And still I didn’t enjoy it. Families at each other’s throats, spitting raw cruelty. Heathcliff horrible, savage. Cathy spoiled and selfish. What was there to like? In the end I thought they both got what they deserved.Which is not to say the book is not well written. Bronte's plot - like so many gothic plots - is highly improbable but holds up, her characters real enough even as they shock and sicken us and the author’s prose style keeps us going to the end. Why? Ask me another. Better still, read it for yourself and see what you think.
5608408431	“wuthering heights is a masterpiece. it’s incredibly unpleasant to read.” -vox.comupon finishing, i immediately researched more into this achingly beautiful book because i am OBSESSED and i feel the above quote summarizes it well. this was my first classic and i’m happy it was. was it a romance? a gothic novel? a tragedy? i’d say all of the above.everything in this novel is so subjective, but heathcliff is the most prominent character in my opinion. his love for catherine, a strong female character, leads to an absolute rollercoaster of events and emotions. alice hoffman stated, “Read “Wuthering Heights” when you’re 18 and you think Heathcliff is a romantic hero; when you’re 30, he’s a monster; at 50 you see he’s just human,”. as of now i see him as all three; although mainly a monster for reasons i won’t say to avoid spoilers. catherine may have been the reason he was so awful although i’m unsure. there are many other important characters but i feel the story revolves around those two. if you want to say “aww” one second and “i can’t believe someone would say that” the next…this book is for you. so many emotions! so much symbolism! stay tuned for more classic reviews because i’m officially hooked! can you tell i’m excited!this was a fun buddy read with rex, glad to have br my first classic since it was a bit confusing at first.*Trigger warnings for mental/physical abuse, sickness, mental health issues, and multiple deaths*
3373629798	¡Nunca antes me había sentido tan enojado en todas las páginas de un libro!¡Es imposible tenerle aprecio a ningún personaje! Unos porque son odiosos, otros porque son egoístas, los hay malcriados y están también los que son muy estúpidos. No existe ese por el que sientes simpatía y pena, que también te hace llegar el dolor por sus infortunios, y la rabia por las injusticias que recibe. ¡No lo hay!Entonces, ¿por qué me gustó tanto este libro si siempre prefiero buenos personajes a una buena historia? Muy fácil, la respuesta reside en la pregunta: porque sí son buenos personajes. Siempre me he sentido atraído por los villanos, los protagonistas insoportables y/o los personajes tóxicos, únicamente cuando están bien construidos. Siento que es mucho más difícil plantar con éxito estas cualidades en un títere y que este se vea real, así como Gollum en El Señor de los Anillos, Cercei y Joffrey en la saga Canción de Hielo y Fuego, o, poniendo un ejemplo actual, todos los personajes de la excelente serie Euphoria. Pido que no me malentiendan, sé que estos personajes tiene algunas cosas en común, son peligrosos, por ejemplo, y eso no es nada bueno. Quería comentar esto ya que siempre me inclino por libros que tienen o están protagonizados por este tipo de personajes, simplemente porque son más complejos que los que todo el mundo ama, porque toman más trabajo realizar. Regresando al libro, Heathcliff es el personaje mejor logrado, en mi opinión. Hubo ocasiones donde me sorprendía su hostilidad, pues, ¿quién le dice a su invitado que descanse si lo necesita o se largue si no? Desde la primera página empezamos a odiarlo por la forma en que recibe a su egocéntrico inquilino. Una nota de Charlotte sobre el libro de su hermana dice que, si no fuera porque Heathcliff trata de hijo a Harenton, podría considerarsele como un demonio. Créanme que Heathcliff es de los mejores personajes que he podido conocer, contaría un sinfín de cosas sobre él pero no quiero arruinarle la historia a quien no la haya leído. Sólo diré que puede ocupar el primer lugar en una lista de los personajes más despreciables de toda la literatura, y agregaré algo que él dijo:"No he sido yo quien te ha roto el corazón, te lo has roto tú misma, y de paso me has roto el mío."Estaría muy mal creer que este libro trata de un amor imposible, porque muchos de los personajes se pueden encasillar entre controlador o controlado. Sin embargo, tampoco podemos ignorar la gran cantidad de frases bonitas que, tristemente, e insisto, se usaron para controlar:"Sea cual sea la sustancia de la que están hechas nuestras almas, la suya y la mía son idénticas..."La escritura de Emily me pareció poderosa, esos saltos que hizo en la narración, no de tiempo, sino de narradores me parecieron increíbles. En un momento estaba narrado por Ellen, en primera persona, después pasaba a Lockwood, también en primera persona, y en ningún momento me dejó con la incógnita de ¿quién está narrando? Creo que es mejor que lo lean ustedes mismo, pues no me creo capaz de explicarlo como se debe. Ahora bien, voy a contar el único aspecto que no me agradó del todo en este libro: la estructura. Me incómodo un poco que toda la historia fuera entre dos personas, una de ellas contándolo todo. El 90% del libro nos cuenta todo lo que pasó en Cumbres Borrascosas y alrededores, lo cual me molestó, puesto que siempre quise encontrarme con el Heathcliff del presente al del pasado, pero fue fácil acostumbrarme; el otro 10% se nos cuenta qué pasa en Cumbre Borrascosas, en el presente del libro.No es hasta el final que me reencontré con el Heathcliff que quería, aunque, llegado a ese punto, extrañé al Heathcliff del pasado. Irónico.Para terminar, no creo que sea necesario aclarar que no es un libro para todo el mundo, pues no todos tienden a preferir personajes odiosos como protagonistas. Empero, si eres de esos lectores que sienten una curiosa atracción por este tipo de personajes, el libro te encantará.Actualización 2023: llevaba meses pensando en ponerle la quinta estrella, pues no fue justo haberle puesto cuatro a uno de mis libros favoritos de la vida.
2440557787	Τί να μπορέσω να γράψω ειλικρινά για να αποδώσω την αγάπη μου γι’ αυτό το μυθιστόρημα φαινόμενο;Ό,τι και να γράψω, δεν μπορεί να περιγράψει το πόσο με είχε συνεπάρει όταν το διάβασα για πρώτη φορά πριν αρκετά χρονια, μα και πόσο με επηρέασε τώρα, στη δεύτερη ανάγνωση. Τώρα ναι. Το κατάλαβα καλύτερα. Το έζησα. Πέρασε μέσα μου αργά και σταθερά η πολυεπίπεδη γραφή και η ποίηση του λόγου και με βύθισαν σε ένα αριστούργημα της φύσης, βαθύτερο, πολύ βαθύτερο απο την πραγματικότητα. Σε καμία περίπτωση δεν είναι μια απλή ρομαντική ιστορία αγάπης. Η Έμιλυ Μπροντέ με την λαμπρή ιδιοφυΐα της, την ποιητική πεζογραφία που δημιουργεί και την προσωπική της εμπειρία συνθέτει μια «εξημερωμένη» αρχαία ελληνική τραγωδία. Είναι ένα βίαιο διαχρονικό κομμάτι άγριας ομορφιάς. Είναι μια θεραπεία της αγάπης που κινείται στα σκοτεινά της ψυχής και καταναλώνει πάθη και λάθη. Υπάρχει πολλή σκληρότητα σε τούτο το έργο μα σίγουρα η κύρια έμπνευση και η ουσία στηρίζονται βασικά σε μια καταθλιπτική διαβάθμιση. Η ποιήτρια Έμιλυ Μπροντέ γράφει με όραμα, συναίσθημα και μαρτυρία. Ήταν μάρτυρας των ίδιων των συναισθημάτων της. Η υπόσταση και η γραφή της δεν προοριζόταν για την πραγματική ζωή, φυσικά ούτε για την Αγγλία του 19ου αιώνα. Ήξερε πως οι άνθρωποι δεν πεθαίνουν για την αγάπη και έτσι έγραψε για το βάρβαρο και άγριο είδος φυσικής αγάπης. Θριάμβευσαν δυο ψυχές που χωρίστηκαν απο προπαγανδιστικές περιστάσεις και στοιχειώθηκαν ώσπου να ενωθούν σε μία. Το σκηνικό εξημερωμένο άγρια, η ατμόσφαιρα γκρίζα, σκοτεινή, γοτθική, το ύφος που διαχέεται σε κάθε ανθρώπινη σχέση είναι σχεδον ψυχωτικό, με έναν τρόπο που ξεπερνάει το θάνατο. Έργο γεμάτο αγάπη, πάθος, εκδίκηση, βία. Δεν σταματάει εκεί, καλύπτει ιδέες και καταστάσεις εποχής, σχετικά με τη φύση, τη θρησκεία, τη δεισιδαιμονία, τις κοινωνικές αξίες. Η ρεαλιστική μορφή του κειμένου είναι απομονωμένη, κοινωνικά ανάρμοστη, παρθενική, προβληματική και έντονα δυαδική. Η επιτομή της αντίθεσης σε όλο το μεγαλείο της φύσης. Σε κάποια σημεία αγγίζει την απόλυτη γυναικεία φαντασία και απο την άλλη, ανατρέπει όλες τις συμβάσεις του ρομαντισμού με παραβατικό τρόπο. Θυελλώδες και συγκλονιστικό, με μυρωδιές και εικόνες, με θλίψη και απομόνωση, με χαρακτήρες κατά κύριο λόγο αντιπαθητικούς ( προσωπικά εξαιρώ τον Χήθκλιφ). Τοπία ανατριχιαστικής γοητείας, σκηνικά πέρα απο κάθε φαντασία, η ανάπτυξη της γραφής αφήνει τη φαντασία μας να ευδοκιμήσει. Να τα ζήσει όλα. Ναι, είναι μια φρικτή ιστορία, ακραία και διπολική, μα έτσι όπως ξετυλίγεται δημιουργεί αρμονία χαρακτήρων και γοτθικών προσλήψεων καταλήγοντας σε μια μακάβρια λυτρωτική αποδόμηση που επιδοκιμάζει την αναγνωστική εμπειρία αυτού του μεγαλείου. Όλοι οι ήρωες και ο καθένας ξεχωριστά θα μπορούσαν να αποτελούν ομάδες καθημερινών σημερινών ανθρώπων. Τα ανεμοδαρμένα ύψη εισάγουν θέματα πολλαπλών διαστάσεων. Βλέπουμε έντονα τα αποτελέσματα του αλκοολισμού, την άξεστη συμπεριφορά του αναλαφαβητισμού, γενικά θέματα εξουσίας, πλούτου, κοινωνικών τάξεων, φεμινιστικές ιδέες, καρικατούρες θρησκείας, οικογενειακά και κληρονομικά πλούτη -υλικά και πνευματικά- θεσμοί δικαιοσύνης, δικαιώματα έγγαμης τυραννίας και πολλά άλλα, που αναφέρονται πολύ μπροστά απο την συγκεκριμένη εποχή. Προσβλητικά για το βικτοριανό κοινό, υποσχόμενα προοπτικές σε πιο σύγχρονο αναγνωστικό πολιτισμό. Η μοναδική πένα της Έμιλυ Μπροντέ γράφει ξεκάθαρα με μία προοπτική, αρνείται να δώσει στον αναγνώστη το τέλος που ίσως θα επιθυμούσε. Αντιθέτως, ρεαλιστικά μπορεί ο καθένας να συνδεθεί με το δικό του συμπέρασμα. Ταξιδεύει μέσα σε δυο σύνολα αφήγησης, σε μία ταλαντευόμενη χρονολογική σειρά, που μεταφέρει με επιτυχία πάνω απο δυο γενιές χαρακτήρων. Ο κάθε χαρακτήρας με διαφορετική προσωπικότητα, υποκειμενικες ιδέες, αντικειμενικές συμπεριφορές. Αυτοί οι παράγοντες ρυθμίζονται απο τη συγγραφέα με θαυμάσιο τρόπο. Διαφορετικά, ασυνήθιστα, όλα όμως, πραγματοποιούνται με κάποιο τρόπο και για συγκεκριμένο λόγο που δεν είναι ποτέ σαφής και τελειωτικός. Άσκοπη αναζήτηση αιτίας και αποτελέσματος. Επιτυχές κάθε συμπέρασμα εξαγόμενο απο συλλογισμούς σε γενικό πλαίσιο δεδομένων. Ευρύ φάσμα αμφισβητούμενων ιδεών, άψογα δομημένοι χαρακτήρες, με μια φρικτή τελειότητα και ισχυρούς δεσμούς, που πολλαπλασιάζονται όσο διαιρούνται, καθιστούν αυτό το έργο ένα πολιτικό αριστούργημα της αγγλικής λογοτεχνίας. Εν κατακλείδι, ας μου επιτραπεί μία υπερβολική δήλωση που προέρχεται απο την μεγάλη μου αγάπη Γι αυτό το βιβλίο. Αν αποτύχει να αγγίξει τα βάθη της ψυχής ή να κάνει υποβλητικά ξεχωριστή εντύπωση, πρέπει ο αναγνώστης είτε να είναι νεκρός ή να διαβάζει λανθασμένη ιστορία. Καμία σχέση δεν έχει το βιβλίο με οποιαδήποτε μεταφορά στην μικρή και μεγάλη οθόνη. Αν έχετε αγαπήσει ή δεν έχετε αγαπήσει ποτέ, διαβάστε το. Θα κλονιστείτε, θα λατρέψετε!!!Καλή ανάγνωση. Πολλούς ασπασμούς.
4328128611	Surprising! This is my first experience with Wuthering Heights, having neither read nor seen film versions before. My immediate reaction is that it is far less romantic than popular culture has implied. I’m also confused why it’s not known more for being a “ghost story” than a romance. I might even argue it should be shelved in the Gothic horror section, next to The Haunting of Hill House, The Turn of the Screw, and The Mysteries of Udolpho.Heathcliff is expectedly brooding and delivers plenty of sexual tension, but he’s also diabolical. His plotting and conniving goes far beyond the insufferable (but endearing) quirks of Mr. Darcy or Mr. Rochester. He’s a jerk on a level that’s pseudo-murderous and financially predatory. His motivations are based on romance, sure, but so are psycho stalker serial killers—and he’s far closer to that than the dream boat many think him to be.Movie versions may be to blame for romanticizing Heathcliff. I understand the iconic 1939 film completely cuts out a generation of characters. These offspring, which an aged Heathcliff torments with merciless ferocity, are aspects of the book that cement his evil nature. Without them I imagine the story could be transformed to a more traditional romance.Not that I want the novel to be traditional. The unexpected qualities are, in my opinion, what make it classic. Characters are complex, deeply flawed, and in many ways responsible for their own tragedies. As a lover of all things horror and gothic, the frightening aspects are welcomed—and there are a number of scary moments.There is an idea about the novel that Heathcliff and Catherine are in love on a higher “spiritual plane” and thus capable of entering the ghostly realm. Bronte consistently compares Heathcliff to the devil and both he and Catherine use religious language to express their passions. They are practically willing to sell their soul—or at least keep it in earthly limbo—to be with one another. It’s a sooty romance that’s all about heat and passion, caring little about what’s Christian. I suppose there is something hot about that, even when Heathcliff so regularly becomes creepy and off-putting.Perhaps there is also appeal in a paramour who loves you so ferociously that he’s willing to torment your entire family line if he can’t be with you. It’s bad behavior, no doubt, but in a fictional fantasy such intense yearning can be skewed as attractive. Certainly other novelists have cashed in on that theme. In many ways, Heathcliff is the template for modern gothic romance, where heroines frequently turn away from traditional hunks to fall in love with the grim domineer of the castle.Stylistically, Bronte’s story-within-a-story structure both adds complexity to the narrative (can we trust all details?) and distances the reader from the action. I can’t say whether I liked this method or not—my gut tells me I didn’t—but obviously something about it works for us to still obsess over this book 175 years later. In the end, it all comes down to my own expectations. Once I looked past pre-conceived notions, I could slip into Bronte’s original vision and enjoy all its dark, imperfect glory.
2197403437	Love, love, loved this book! I read this many yeas ago and the story still remains a favorite. I loved the original film as well, I watched many many times. The version with Mere Oberon and Laurence Olivier and David Novel (1939 ).

345002434	A classic! A classic! And one of the most godawful boring books I've ever forced myself through! I felt in need of clockwork-orange-style eyelid openers for most of the book. This novel is a great example of exactly why high school students learn to hate reading 'classics.'
8022023032	[4.0⭐] 𝘾𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙖𝙨 es una novela gótica escrita por Emily Brontë y publicada en 1847. La historia se sitúa en el norte de Inglaterra y gira en torno a dos familias (los Earnshaw y los Linton), cuyas vidas quedan marcadas por la pasión, la venganza y la obsesión. En el centro de todo está la relación entre Heathcliff y Catherine Earnshaw, un vínculo tan intenso y destructivo que atraviesa generaciones y desafía la noción misma del amor romántico.No sé muy bien cómo sentirme respecto a este libro y ni siquiera sé cómo escribir esta reseña, por eso me he demorado tanto en actualizar mi Goodreads. 𝘾𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙖𝙨 me dejó una sensación tan ambigua que todavía no sé si me gustó o no me gustó la experiencia de leerla. Fue una lectura que pasó por muchos momentos: se me hizo lenta, luego muy rápida, después otra vez lenta y nuevamente rápida. Fue una marea, literalmente. Hice muchas pausas lectoras (piensen que lo empecé en mayo y recién lo terminé la última semana de octubre) y, sin embargo, algo en él me obligaba a volver, aunque fuera para leer solo un par de páginas más.Lo cierto es que me esperaba algo más de esta obra, sobre todo porque es uno de esos clásicos que tenía muy pendientes. Siempre sentí que 𝘾𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙖𝙨 era un libro que, como literata, tenía que leer en algún momento. Mi profesor de literatura universal del siglo XIX nos habló con tanta pasión de las hermanas Brontë que me convenció de empezar por esta novela, ya que él decía que era su favorita de las tres. Ahora que la he terminado, entiendo por qué genera tanto debate, pero mi sensación general fue un poco de “meh”. No en el sentido de que no me gustara, sino en que me costó conectar emocionalmente con ella del modo en que esperaba.La magia de esta lectura está, sin duda, en la forma en que está narrada. Me fascinó cómo vamos reconstruyendo lo ocurrido a través de las voces de los personajes, especialmente la de Nelly, el ama de llaves, que se convierte en una narradora tan parcial como intrigante. Todo lo que sabemos pasa por su filtro y eso le da un aire de misterio constante, como si nunca pudiéramos confiar del todo en lo que se nos cuenta. Esa estructura de historia dentro de otra historia, hace que uno se sienta parte del chisme ya que es un relato oral que ha ido mutando con los años.Además, es una novela donde el espacio tiene un papel central. Las cumbres, con su clima violento, sus tormentas y su aislamiento, no son solo un escenario: se sienten como un personaje más. Hay algo profundamente simbólico en esos paisajes fríos y salvajes que reflejan la furia y la desesperación de los protagonistas. Cada vez que Brontë describe los páramos, el viento o la lluvia golpeando las ventanas, sentía que la naturaleza respiraba al mismo ritmo que Heathcliff y Catherine.Hablando de esos dos protagonistas, no entiendo por qué hay gente que dice que esta es una historia de amor, ni por qué tantas personas quieren “ser Catherine”, creo que quienes lo afirman no entendieron nada de la novela. 𝘾𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙖𝙨 NO es una historia de amor romántico: es una historia sobre la obsesión, la dependencia emocional y la autodestrucción. Heathcliff y Catherine se aman, pero de una manera enfermiza e inhumana. Su vínculo es una condena, NO es un refugio. Incluso, llega a ser una unión que se alimenta del sufrimiento mutuo y, lo más impresionante, es que Brontë logra que uno no pueda dejar de mirar ese desastre.Hay algo fascinante en cómo Emily Brontë retrata la oscuridad del alma humana. Su pluma tiene una belleza gótica innegable: hay violencia y poesía en cada descripción del paisaje, en cada diálogo cargado de rabia y deseo. Me gusta mucho el estilo gótico y romántico, así que, en ese sentido, este libro cumple con todo lo que amo de ese tipo de literatura: la atmósfera opresiva, los personajes atormentados y la constante presencia de la muerte. Además, me encanta que sea una de las primeras obras en incluir un espectro.Otra cosa que me sorprendió es lo adelantada que resulta la novela para su época. La construcción de Heathcliff como personaje es increíble: un huérfano marcado por la discriminación, la humillación y el odio, que termina convirtiéndose en lo mismo que lo destruyó: es el ejemplo perfecto del ciclo de la violencia. Brontë lo pinta con una complejidad brutal y Catherine no se queda atrás: su egoísmo y su incapacidad para elegir entre la pasión y la estabilidad la hacen tan real que hasta duele. Ambos son detestables, pero, al mismo tiempo, son imposibles de olvidar.Me impresionó también cómo Brontë explora la idea del trauma generacional, mostrando cómo los errores y odios de una generación se repiten en la siguiente. La segunda parte del libro (con Cathy, Hareton y Linton) es casi un espejo distorsionado de la primera, una repetición trágica donde los hijos heredan los fantasmas de sus padres. En el fondo, es una novela sobre cómo el dolor y el rencor pueden transmitirse, incluso sin quererlo, de una vida a otra y de generación en generación.A pesar de mis pausas, de lo irregular que me resultó el ritmo y de mis momentos de desconexión, no puedo negar que es una obra poderosa. Hay capítulos que me parecieron poéticamente devastadores y hay frases que todavía tengo dando vueltas en la cabeza. Brontë logra que uno sienta el frío de las cumbres, la desesperación de los personajes y la tristeza infinita de un amor que no puede existir en este mundo.Al final, más que una historia de amor, 𝘾𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙖𝙨 es una historia sobre el poder destructivo de las emociones humanas. Sobre cómo el amor, cuando se mezcla con la venganza y el orgullo, se convierte en un veneno letal. Sobre cómo el pasado se niega a morir. Sobre cómo incluso la muerte no basta para separar a quienes están condenados a buscarse eternamente.Finalmente, puedo decir que 𝘾𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙖𝙨 fue una montaña rusa de emociones. Reconozco el valor literario y emocional de esta obra: es gótica, apasionada, trágica y profundamente humana. No es una novela fácil ni amable, pero sí una que deja huella.
47189921	I am very happy to have read this book again, it gets better every time. All the romanticism, and I don´t mean this in the Disney sense of the word, but the real, out of this world romantic notion of life and love is there. Heathcliff is probably the most hated character in the history of all novels, but he's in the end someone who you see for all the suffering and all he has endured. And with only one person in the world who he ever connected with. And there is this thing with nature which is pretty great, they are in the middle of nowhere, so its frustrating that Heathcliff can get away with anything. I loved reading this again, and more after reading a biography of the Brontes, they are pretty great, and their lives reflect on their stories, just as this book seems like such a reflection of the Bronte way of life and Household. Loved it very much, thank you!
3120424213	i love reading books about crazy and straight up evil people(that's all I'm gonna say about this book for now since my brain is totally fried)
3823726159	It’s so unusual to find a good story with terrible characters. I don’t mean characters we dislike due to their personality or choices, but because, at their core, they’re weak or cruel or, maybe, just plain evil. So, to open up a book 175 years old, having only heard “It’s a great love story!” as guidance, Wuthering Height is probably the biggest false advertisement I’ve ever faced which made it so much better to read.Being honest, the beginning was slow and boring. It’s the most technically challenging book I’ve read in a while after a break from reading and a large consumption of mostly YA books in the past few years. Secondly, I didn’t know where it was going. Heathcliff may be the star of this story, but he’s not the one to tell it. Our protagonist, Mr Lockwood, is literally a random person who doesn’t hold any relevance to the plot except to hear the woeful tale of Wuthering Heights from someone who also isn’t Heathcliff (a bit like a book Inception, if you will). But the more I got stuck in and the more my page count trickled upward each day, I came to appreciate it for what it was. Not a love story exactly, but instead a depiction of the cruelty and wickedness of humanity.Long story short. Heathcliff, a gypsy boy, is adopted by Earnshaw to Wuthering Heights, a house among the Moors. There he spends his childhood, in love with Earnshaw’s daughter Catherine, hated by Hindley, Earnshaw’s son. As they grow up, their lives become entangled with another family, the Linton’s, and they more they intersect, the more chaos is caused. For a lot of the story, I wondered where were things going, because from the start all of these characters continued to be unpredictable. Cathy is bad-tempered, Hindley, abusive, The Lintons, weak, (though I liked them both) and Heathcliff…he’s basically a sociopath, I don’t know what other way to put it. All their children are equally frustrating (with such similar names to their parentage), yet I was completely sucked into the drama of their lives. Because this book takes the risk of of irredeemable characters, it suddenly becomes so more unique and fascinating to read. They have unhappy marriages, are abusive, treat one another terribly, that you lose hope in their humanity. And to think of how long ago this was published, I would’ve loved to seen the uproar at time. Because how many happy books and characters do we have? How many relationships are unbreakable and honest, and last without flaws? This could’ve been an easy love story about a boy from a low background trying to marry a girl who’s from a privileged family. But no. Heathcliff and Cathy are callous and deceitful, and marry other people, and then treat their spouses with hatred. It’s remarkable a book this old went to challenge social norms during such a conservative time period. Never once is there sympathy in this book. People hate (or love) each so much, they dedicate their lives to getting revenge in such weird ways on each other. And that's where the believability lies. These cruel character with their selfish impulses and violence reflect the part of society and relationships we don't talk about. We like the happy endings and soul mates, but this book is just a portrayal of the opposite side. The qualities of the characters in this book are qualities that exist in real life, and maybe we'd like to believe they're unrealistic, but the truth is, most people lay between this and the Disney, rom-com ending. We'd just rather not see the former because we want to believe love is a perfect thing, when this book proves that's not always a correct view to have. In terms of characters, Nellie and Edgar were the only remotely nice people, as well as Hareton. And I’m just clarifying my stance here, but there is no way Heathcliff can be considered redeemable. He’s a brilliant character and incredibly complex, but to those who are convinced he’s some kind of swash-buckling romantic figure, I’m just so confused. Give me your thought process. I must admit, I also see the allure of referring to this book as romance novel due to the sheer intensity of Heathcliff and Cathy’s relationship, but I feel Bronte was much more focused on the negative aspects of these characters. Yes, they may be abusers and wicked people, but they can love in their own, odd ways. At the same time, they’re still abusers and wicked people. Their love, strong as it is, does not detract from the things they’ve done. In fact, maybe their love was the cause of the downfall of all these people anyway.I didn’t mind “It’s a story, about a guy who’s told a story” as a choice of narrative, and while I actually felt I didn’t get a full picture of the Moors, I feel the spooky atmosphere was always spot on. My stars are lost on the general slowness of the beginning and the last fifty pages took such a random turn, I put down the book to laugh at the absurdness of it, thinking “what is this book?” It felt like the third act twist of a B-list horror move. But the characters and their choices stayed fascinating and the psychology of each one of them left so much for me to explore. I thought it was a bold take on what we expect of a romance story and I'm glad I picked it up. (I really hated Heathcliff's son though. I just need to write that down.)
7703484219	“He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.” My teachers used to gift a novel to every topper each year... That was the fascination for me and I used to anticipate the prize distribution day.That's how I got this novel in my third grade. Can you just believe that?I flipped through the pages and found out in the introduction that the book was somehow related to romance... and I decided that I would read the book once I got older...So, this had always been my most anticipated classic novel.I got so confused in the middle... when they were referring to Cathy and Catherine... nvm... I had to reread the parts.This is not the typical classic rom novels we read... Here, love is a Category 5 hurricane, a relentless battering of the soul that leaves every character involved... emotionally disfigured and often physically deceased...Heathcliff, our Byronic hero (or perhaps... more accurately... our brooding Byronic villain with a really good marketing team)... spends the entire book proving that obsession is not... in fact... a particularly attractive quality. He's the original "nice guy" who finishes last... then burns down your house, kicks your dog and maybe... curses your descendants for good measure. Occasionally, I kept swooning over his tormented soul... but then you remember he locked his wife in a room and generally treated everyone like dirt... and suddenly... that brooding looks a lot like unresolved anger issues.And Catherine? Oh Cathy! She's the kind of woman who thrives on drama... who makes decisions with the emotional maturity of a particularly volatile toddler... and who seems genuinely surprised when her choices lead to utter misery for everyone in her orbit. Her declaration of being Heathcliff's "soulmate" feels less like a profound spiritual connection and more like a co-dependent addiction that should have been addressed with a good therapist and a strong intervention.The moors... of course... are practically a character themselves– bleak, desolate and perfectly mirroring the emotional landscape of the inhabitants. I could almost feel the wind whipping through my hair... carrying with it the faint scent of betrayal and damp tweed.But let me tell you... The book is completely, utterly, magnificently mad!!! Because it’s a brilliant!!! The utterly unhinged passion takes to its most destructive extreme!!!Well, Enjoy!!!
2975436701	Wuthering Heights is a beautiful, dark spectacle. Its relentless gloom and utter lack of redemption seem extraordinary for its time, and refreshing in a peculiar way. The choice of removing the narrative by two degrees from the novel's events has the effect of obscuring the motives of the principal characters, which leaves the novel unfortunately prone to a simplistic interpretation. One, however, must read between the lines. These are complex characters, caught in a web of causation that amplifies and perpetuates their flaws. I love the novel's ambiguity, its refusal to guide the reader to a clear destination, forcing you to seek your own way thorough its dark moors.
7586056226	I always feel strange rating a classic poorly, but I just don’t think this one was for me. I enjoyed the start, getting set right into this bleak atmosphere. I even enjoyed being introduced to the characters, flawed as they were. But as the story continued, I just became increasingly frustrated at every single character (and not in a good way). I just did not feel invested at all by the end. Sorry!! :(
18618556	Wuthering Heights is many things. A late-gothic ghost story. A tale of love and revenge. A chronicle of violence -- physical, mental, emotional and social. A dark peek into human nature. A condemnation of England's broken class system. A sort of anti-Austen book without manners.I've loved it since I first read it in grade eight. It's another of the books my crazy cool Mom foisted upon me in her big, three year pushing of classics that defined my reading tastes for the rest of my life. I love the book so much, and Emily Brontë's leading man, that I named my daughter Brontë (dooming her, no doubt, to a life of pain, depression, and unfinished business, sorry Të).This time through, however, I found myself not caring a whit about Heathcliff and Catherine the Older, or Hareton and Catherine the Younger, or Edgar, or Isabella, or Linton the king whinger. I found myself caring about Nelly Dean, and only Nelly Dean. And in so doing I discovered another thing that Wuthering Heights is: the most circuitous character sketch in the English language. To read Wuthering Heights caring only about Nelly is to read an entirely different story. Suddenly the ill-fated love of Heathcliff and Cathy -- the torture and pain and ghosts and revenge -- becomes the way Nelly reveals herself, and the unreliability of Nelly as a narrator becomes the very stuff of herself. Every action she comments on, every action she claims to take, every piece of those tales she tells Lockwood cease to be about her subjects and, instead, reveal her as the subject. She is the star of her own narrative, and all those characters she claims to love or hate are mere supporting players to a servant's tale of herself. Which, for me, makes Wuthering Heights even more brilliant than I've always believed it to be. I wonder what a stage version of this would look like if one were to use Nelly's perspective AND make her the focus, subverting her attempts to obfuscate her importance. Maybe I should take a crack at it. Or maybe I could just pass the idea on to my very own Brontë. I bet she could do something magnificent with it someday.
602713094	Vastly overrated hysterical nonsense. One feels there is a good novel in there somewhere, and a more experienced writer might have been more successful. There are Gothic elements which could have been explored, characters who deserved to be more fully fleshed out (the only believable character is the narrator, the servant Nellie Dean) and surely a world outside the two houses and their navel-gazing inmates, which is never mentioned. Not to mention incredibly complicated time shifts and an unnecessary flashback structure which only serves to distract the reader from the plot. As if 3 generations of similarly named characters were not difficult enough to keep track of; all the Haretons, Hindleys, Heathcliffe (Was Emily disappointed in love, one wonders - let down by a suitor named H______ much as Jane (Austen) had been by her W______? But I digress.) This much-lauded "mastery of an extremely complex structure" (as one critic will have it) seems to me extremely amateurish. Every so often, the author recollects that the narrator is an actual character, and breaks off at a random moment to bring the reader back to the present. Irritating.I find myself wondering why this novel attracts so much adoration from modern readers. Is it because it is the only novel by the middle one of the Brontë sisters? The one who died tragically young, blah-di-blah-di-blah? Has it just been lumped with all the Haworth hyperbole? I find all the Brontë trio deficient when compared with the sheer breadth of compass of many other 19th Century writers, and Emily seems by far the weakest. In fact I've suspected for a long time that because the Parsonage at Haworth (the family home) and many of their childhood artefacts still exist, this may be almost entirely responsible for firing the public's imagination. Maybe a lot of the self-absorption of the writers and their characters can be attributed to the fact that the Brontë's water supply ran through the graveyard. This in itself must be enough to make anyone feel unwell and inclined to emote all the time. "Cathy" surely needed a good slap. In fact most of the characters' agonising may have mysteriously disappeared if they'd only had something to DO!! (Now I'm revealing my origins - fully Yorkshire Protestant Work Ethic….)Every decade or so I have taken this down from the bookshelf to give it another chance. Never again. It has now been consigned for ever more to someone else's. May they have joy of it. For me it remains the most overrated classic of all time.
4643752043	I read this over 20 years ago and since I can’t remember what people were telling my yesterday it was like I was reading this for the first time!I couldn’t put the book down yesterday and read over 250 pages. I couldn’t believe how terrible and scheming Heathcliff was. Talking about taking revenge and having a bug up your ass. Whoo! But I guess Catherine, the person who he grew up with and then forsook him because another man had more status and money, was not blameless by a long shot.The book I read from was an Everyman’s Library edition with an introduction by Katherine Frank. She had written a book about Emily Bronte (A Chainless Soul: A Life of Emily Bronte), putting forth the interesting notion that Emily Bronte had an eating disorder, anorexia. Certainly some of the protagonists in the novel refused to eat at times (Catherine, Heathcliff near the end). I had a hard time keeping names straight at times during the novel. Doesn’t help when a daughter is married after the mother (two Catherines although they do not cross paths in the novel since Catherine #1 dies in childbirth giving birth to Catherine #2.The story mostly was told by the maid/servant, Nelly, recollecting what happened in the past. There was another narrator. Mr. Lockwood, but he didn’t figure prominently in the novel.One confession: when Joseph the old servant of Heathcliff spoke in the novel, I ignored what he said. I did that because I didn’t know what the hell he was saying. Here is an example. I didn’t have the time or patience to decipher/translate what he was saying.• “Thear!” he ejaculated, “Hareton, thah willn’t sup they porridge tuh neeght; they’ll be nowt bud lumps as big as maw nave. Thear, agean! Aw;d fling in bowl un all, if aw wer yah! Thear, pale t’ guilp off, un’ then yah’ll hae done wi’t. Bang, bang. It’s a marcy t’bothom isn’t deaved aht!”Note: While I was reading the novel, I could not get Kate Bush’s song, Wuthering Heights, out of my head.... 😉 🤪 🤨And then when I was finished, I started watching youtube videos of Kate Bush singing Wuthering Heights (and dancing/miming ), and I watched it several times because it was so damn good! Now I really can’t get it out of my head! 😏
402259360	"I am Heathcliff - he's always, always in my mind - not as a pleasure, any more then I am always a pleasure to myself - but, as my own being.”--Catherine Last year I read Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre with my YA class as a way of introducing them to a historical context for romance novels and the gothic and I loved it. Jane, Jane, Jane! This year I read Wuthering Heights with my YA class for similar reasons, and I liked it quite a lot, but not nearly as much as I did Jane Eyre. Such was the case with reviewers when WH came out in 1847, by Charlotte’s younger sister Emily. It’s not a bildungsroman, we want a bildungsroman! In other words, a more straightforward coming-of-age, rags-to-riches story with an ending we are happy with.Emily Bronte puzzled her readers and reviewers in 1847 with this essentially two part generational narrative structure, and, well, if you think the brooding Rochester is complicated, okay, but the brooding Heathcliff?! I mean, there is something to consider in many of the great nineteenth century female authors creating their beloved famous dark and brooding heroes: Darcy (from Pride and Prejudice), Rochester (from Jane Eyre) and now the beastiest of the broodiest beast of all, Heathcliff. What’s a young man reading these books to think he should do to become attractive to women?! Is this how frogs in desks and pigtails in ink came about as a signal to attraction? Marry me or I will go insane and torment you forever?!“Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living. You said I killed you--haunt me then. The murdered do haunt their murderers. I believe--I know that ghosts have wandered the earth. Be with me always--take any form--drive me mad. Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! It is unutterable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!”--HeathcliffI won’t review the plot in great detail, you have 2,000 reviews for that, but well, this is a gothic story (with moors and wild dogs and storms and ghosts and over-the-top wild and passionate speeches) which may indeed be a romance, if you can count being driven to animality (the beast to Catherine’s beauty?) and if driven-to-insanity can count as a kind of love. If obsession can count as a kind of love. And if Heathcliff is a hard sell as romantic hero (to me, but I’m not the target audience for his vibe), Catherine Earnshaw is no typically romantic heroine, either, choosing wealthier and saner Edgar Linton to marry against her baser and more elemental instincts. As she admits, she is in love with both Linton and Heathcliff, yin/yang, wants both of them in her life, but of Heathcliff she says,“He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.” The second half, in which Heathcliff tries to wed his frail and whiny son Linton (whom he fathered with Isabella, Edgar Linton’s sister; I know, you need a character map with multiple highlighters to follow this one) to young Catherine, his real love Catherine’s daughter, well it just isn’t as interesting as the first half, with a less memorable conclusion, though there are powerful moments, such as Heathcliff’s dramatic confrontation with the married and pregnant Catherine. And there’s ghost sightings, always good to have ghost sightings in a gothic tale.Overall, worthy of a classic, I’d say!
882822504	Dark, atmospheric, disturbing and fascinating. I love reading about horrible characters, doomed romances, bleakness and darkness, so this was perfect for me. It's awfully dramatic and ridiculous at times, but I loved it all.
1826995537	Have you ever read a book years later with a completely different opinion? This was my peculiar experience, having picked up Wuthering Heights. I created an ideal of the passionate, brooding man, but alas! How damn insufferable are Heathcliff and Catherine. RUTHLESS. Locked in a poisonous, passionate love that destroyed the lives of everyone that came near... but the pain of Wuthering Heights is the unrequited love. Had he stood a minute longer, he would have known how Catherine really felt. He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same Be with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! The last time I read this book was as a teenager—my Mom and I read it together, immersed in the man who defied everything for his one true love—but as an adult, I think the poor guy needs grief therapy. There were a multitude of unhealthy behaviors. Let me destroy every single person who’s ever crossed my path because the love of my life is gone, BUT don't they deserve it? Everyone made Healthcliff's life hell, treating him no less than an animal in a cage. It was only Catherine who saw his true self, his worth. But wait, I’m still obsessed with their passionate, death-defying words. Is that weird? If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger I was intrigued by the side characters and how trauma, rage, jealousy, and loss can destroy and ruin souls. Before and after Catherine’s death, nothing is okay. Each character, dripping with flaws, is constantly stuck in looping chaos. Treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies Yet, Emily Brontë writes like a poet. An author who can make you feel all kinds of things has done her job. The narrator, Nelly, a servant, retells the story in a way that we all retell stories about troubled people. It’s not like Nelly likes these characters; she’s reiterating their flaws and is shocked by imperfect characters. Heathcliff tells Nelly: My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me The world we live in today is riddled with terms like toxic, codependent, obsessive, and bipolar. These words echoed in my thinking throughout the reading. It was a bit of a shock that Heathcliff, like a criminal, raged against so many. The first time I read Wuthering Heights, I viewed Heathcliff as an actual victim, now more an angry man, stopping at nothing to get his revenge (and every time I have a BUT)...This book is so well done because the victim is also a criminal. It's the dichotomy that continually persisted.The strange juxtaposition of my youth and adulthood still brings me back to Wuthering Heights. A classic novel that defies logic. It is a well-executed read of psychologically dynamic characters brought to life by one of the greatest authors. 5/5 stars
3535618550	Note: Content and trigger warnings are written at the end as they may contain spoilers."Treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies."Yorkshire, England (ca. 1700s – 1800s) — Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights towers as a tight exploration of the cycles of intergenerational abuse, wrapped in a façade of exceptional Gothic romance that blinds readers from Brontë's bold efforts in challenging the safe, trite Victorian ideas of her time.Not many a time a novel so complex exists that it can be viewed in two perspectives, as a romance novel or a tragedy, with one stealing the narrative's glory in comparison with viewing it using the other. Wuthering Heights does this perspectival paradox so well that it continues to polarize readers from its first publication when Brontë is still known as Ellis Bell, until today when the world acknowledges the book to be one of the greatest among the English literary canon. In Heights, Brontë fearlessly depicts the Gothic qualities of the story she has in mind: through the atmospheric description of the Yorkshire moors, the mentions of ghosts and ghost-like characters, and the eerily comprehensive introduction of the Heights known for the "quantity of grotesque carvings on its doors" and the "wilderness of crumbling griffins" in its premises. Through her brilliant use of doubles, juxtaposition, and parallelism to highlight the intricacies of her drama, Brontë crafts a multi-faceted story that is as messy and vicious as its characters and their genealogy can be. With Brontë's courageous efforts to challenge societal ideals and push the confines of on-page stark violence acceptability in novels, the elusive author has created a pioneering text of the Gothic genre and a definitive English classic confident enough to defy religious and moral Victorian expectations.Wuthering Heights may certainly be unpleasant, but it is the type of unpleasant where you classify beautiful nightmares and immersive narratives under—the genius Emily Brontë did, and the genius nobody can discredit her from extraordinarily creating.Personal Enjoyment: 4.75 starsQuality of the Book: 4.4 stars- Use of Language: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐- Plot and Narrative Arc: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐- Characters: ⭐⭐⭐⭐- Integrity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐- Message: ⭐⭐⭐⭐AVG: 4.58 stars | RAVE-----CW/TW: physical violence, physical abuse, mental abuse, self-harm, suicide¹-----Note:[1] SPOILER: It is important to scrutinize the context of the suicide of Heathcliff as it may be different from those rooted on contemporary mental health issues.

6103862817	”Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.””You said I killed you - haunt me, then!”wasted. beautiful words wasted on this book. take them out and put them somewhere else.also literally the only beautiful words in this book cause i’m still wondering whether the great writing is in the room with us.my copy has an afterword by virginia wolf which includes the quote “There is no *I* in Wuthering Heights” and while i understand what she was trying to say there’s quite frankly too many fucking *I*s in this god awful book. there’s so many in fact that if you accidentally blink while reading you will instantly lose track of who is speaking and never figure it out again.which brings me to my main criticism of this.why the fuck. was this. the chosen narration style. why the fuck was the housekeeper telling this story to some random dude five hundred years (twenty) after the fact. why was she just in every scene like this 🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️. can’t even have an insane moment of confessing your love without her bothering everyone. why was this told in first person from a random uninvolved party. ???? also heathcliff and catherine. quite frankly. barely in there. a lot of people in there who coincidentally are also named either heathcliff or catherine (or linton) so i guess not really true but og heathcliff and catherine? i don’t know them. never met.how am i supposed to get invested in a relationship when the majority of scenes are just about this housekeeper housekeeping other people. i don’t give a single flying fuck about nelly. or that random dude she told all of this to (i forgot his name, does it matter, he was one of the five hundred first person narrators, you know who i mean).but do i give a fuck about heathcliff and catherine? also no. everyone is like “oh they are toxic and awful people” and maybe, but once again, they are barely in this to get invested in their toxicity and awfulness.is this the worst classic i have ever read? yes.
7907981933	HEATHCLIFF YOU DRAMATIC B!T¢HThat “should you die, do not go to heaven or hell, stay on earth and haunt me as a ghost until we can go together kind of love” is what a girl like me has been waiting for her whole life.I understand why Wuthering Heights has an entire cult of literature students, sad girls, and emotionally unstable poets in its corner. This book is chaos incarnate in the best possible way, the kind of love story that’s a fever dream of obsession, class resentment, and asks the eternal question: what if your soulmate is also your worst enemy and possibly a ghost?This multi-generational drama is a centuries old meditation on revenge, inheritance, and grief. It is also a study on obsession, colonialism, trauma, and the way generational curses pass through families like bad weather. The Earnshaws and Lintons are basically case studies in the emotional sociology of rot.Emily Brontë wrote this book and said, “I’m going to redefine what it means to love, destroy, haunt, and reincarnate out of spite.” The woman did not miss. Heathcliff is what happens when revenge and love morph into one emotion. My god. That man was insufferable. Unredeemable. A romantic and a monster, which I think is precisely Brontë’s point: that love, taken to its extremes, is monstrous. That vengeance feels righteous until you’ve burned down your own house to keep warm. Catherine, she’s the blueprint for the girls who would absolutely ruin their own lives out of spite and longing, we love her for it though. And the moors aren’t just scenery, they’re a character, an endless echo chamber for those who loved too hard and too wrong.There’s also something quietly radical in Brontë’s world building, the murky questions of Heathcliff’s race and outsider status, the way class operates like gravity in this story: unseen but inescapable. Wuthering Heights might read like pure gothic melodrama, but beneath that, it’s a critique of who gets to belong, that is, in families, in society, in love.Let’s talk about the big three themes:Class: every act of cruelty is a social performance, every love story a rebellion against the ladder people were forced to climb or fall from.Race: the quiet but potent “othering” of Heathcliff. It’s interesting that Brontë saw empire and class violence before we even had words for it.Love: the kind of all consuming, spiritually catastrophic attachment that’s toxic, not to be confused with passionate, but also is somehow passionate? And yet, what a soap opera. The emotional whiplash is delicious:“I hate you.”“No, I hate you.”“I love you.”“No, I love you.”“Die.”“Okay.”“But wait for me.”By the end, I was drained but like good drained. Final verdict: 5 stars. It’s messy. It’s toxic. It’s perfect. The moors are empty because Heathcliff has already taken everyone out in the name of love and left no survivors.

True, he didn't come to Wuthering Heights under the best of circumstances, being an adopted "dark skinned" interloper in a household full of spoiled brats with inattentive adult supervision. And he had no role models of kindness and compassion to speak of. But holy shit Brontë, cut us a little slack. Even the so-called "love" that Heathcliff allegedly has for Catherine manifests itself in a cauldron of bile and vitriol so perpetual and unrelenting that almost everyone in his sphere of influence is driven to an early grave. And he doesn't stop there. No sir. He just redoubles his insidious efforts by targeting and manipulating their decendents. Dogs are kicked and beaten and hung with handkerchiefs from bridle hooks. Children are slapped and scorned and terrorized. And that's not even the worst of it. Yet, I kept reading. I kept thinking that there had to be redemption and retribution in there somewhere. Heathcliff was going to slip and fall into a live volcano, slicing himself on razor shards of obsidian (encrusted with anthrax) on the way down… right?
