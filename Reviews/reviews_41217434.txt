2762254605	This is gonna be one of the kick-ass, fast paced, astonishing YA novels of the year with full of non-stop action, introduces us one of the brilliant, badass heroine, November! Her name belongs to month of Scorpio sign and so there’s so much hidden potential and secrets inside this character and I think she’s going to discover herself and turn into her perfect version on the upcoming novels of the series which I cannot wait to read them. It’s great to see a movie producer and actor can write so powerful, entertaining, captivating book! I really recommend it to action, mystery fans! It reminds you of the combination of Syfy channel’s Deadly Class series and some darker Harry Potter books( starting with book 4 when Cedric Diggory dies to book 7) without magic but full of violence. I tried to read it slowly because I didn’t want it to end but in the meantime I couldn’t put it down. But I had really great time when I was hooked by the story.
2757101489	~Synopsis~When November Addley’s father sends her away to boarding school because it's too dangerous back home, she doesn’t know what to expect. But she definitely doesn’t expect to be sent to a school that’s completely off the grid--with no access to the internet or even electricity. Classes range from poison to dagger-throwing, and November starts to question who her father really is. But she doesn’t have much time to worry about that. Someone’s killing the students in the school, and November might be next...~Plot~This book is fast-paced and intriguing. There’s a lot of mind-games being played by the teachers and the students, and it’s all explained in detail and incredibly interesting. It’s definitely a major appeal that sets this book apart from the rest. The book has quite a few twists along the road, and Mather effectively instills a sense of distrust in every one of the characters, despite the fact that the main character is an optimist.There are a few tropes present in this story, none of which that I can go into depth over without spoiling major plot points. However, despite these tropes, the plot is well executed (pun intended ;) ) and not at all derivative of recurring themes you tend to see in young adult novels these days. Like any young adult book, this one has a little romance thrown into the mix, but it isn’t the main focus of the story (no the main focus is training in the art of deception and murder and whatnot). The romance is cute and moves the story forward, rather than detracting from it.~Characters~It's nice to read a young adult book where the main character is an extrovert. A lot of bookworms can relate to the introverted bookish protagonist, but it can get old pretty quickly. Killing November is a refreshing take on the student-training-to-be-an-assassin trope. (She’s a friendly extrovert who loves people!? Not exactly what you’d expect from an expert knife thrower.)Because November is at a school where everyone is hiding their true selves, Mather employs an interesting writing technique to help us get a better sense of who November is. She frequently refers to her best friend Emily in her inner dialogue. The way that she talks about Emily and the things that Emily would say to her is very informative about November's personality and past.I recommend this book to those looking for a quick read about people training in the arts of poison and deception. There’s a lot of politics and deceit, and it’s nothing like your typical high school drama. I’m definitely looking forward to the next instalment in this series! *Thank you to Knopf Books for Young Readers and OLA Super Conference for the ARC for review* This review appeared first on https://powerlibrarian.wordpress.com/ Instagram | Blog | Website | Twitter My 2019 Reading Challenge
2748423325	Killing November by Adriana Mather is the first book of the young adult thriller series by the same name. This opening book of the series certainly set up a creepy atmospheric setting dropping the main character into a boarding school in an old castle in the opening pages.November Adley had reluctantly agreed to go away to school for a few weeks when her father proposed the idea to keep her safe while dealing with some issues at home. Waking up in the strange location with no memory after the plane leaves November questioning what she had agreed to.The rules at the mysterious Academy Absconditi certainly raise a few questions too as November is told about the eye for an eye system and told to keep her identity secret. Things certainly don’t kook up any when November joins the other students and not only stumbles across a dead body but needs to dodge attempts on her own life.Well, Killing November by Adriana Mather certainly took an often used setting of a boarding school to a whole new level. This secret school was the home to an even more secretive society with whom family feuds had spanned decades and the kids here learn way more than a normal curriculum. A rather dark and eerie teen action thriller this one was hard to put down.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/
2588853343	Disclaimer: This book was sent to me by the publisher, Random House Children’s, via NetGalley for an honest review. Opinion: You know those books you come across that sound AMAZING, like they will be an EXACT fit for you, and are already praised and LOVED by EVERYONE? And then you start reading it, all giddy and excited for what’s to come……but then you get about 60 pages in and are just kind of like…Yeah. …Killing November. November assumed she had a normal upbringing, that was until she arrived at Academy Absconditi. Here, the students aren’t animated with conversation, worried about calculus tests and pining over who will ask them to homecoming. Their movements are deliberate, and they are masters at mind games and killing. So why would November’s father leave her in a place like this? Where the teachers enact an “eye for an eye” punishment system, family secrets are to be kept hidden for one’s safety and students keep turning up dead? Surrounded by people who assume she is weaving a clever game of innocence and daftness, November is thrust into a world she can barely navigate, all the while trying to learn the secrets of her family and who she is. Killing November is a YA Mystery dripping in deceit, manipulation, darkness and brutality. I witnessed all these themes and more while reading. But in the end, all I was REALLY left feeling,was indifference.It started out great. November describes being named after a maple tree, how her father describes her as “too trusting”, and having awakened in dungeon-like room with little idea how she arrived there. Who wouldn’t be intrigued? As I started reading more, I learned that November is just like most of us readers – not entirely proficient in the art of deceiving and killing people via poisons, a bow and arrow or a set of freshly sharpened knives. Woe is us for our normalcy. She knows nothing of Strategia – an ancient secret society of spies and assassins, has barely heard a whisper about the Families of the Strategia who are responsible for pulling the strings behind MAJOR historical events throughout history, and has no idea how she fits into any of it. So as the story started picking up and November was thrust into her new lessons, I started noticing a constant theme of wishy-washiness with this character. For most of the story, November is running around like a confused goose saying and doing the wrong things. I don’t blame the poor girl either, this school sounds like a nuthouse. But when November is given a task in lessons to steal a scarf off another player in the dark, or throw knives at targets…she becomes arrogant and cocky and just magically knows what she is doing. Look, I love a confident character who has witty comments and a snarky attitude.I know that she had a little training in these areas as a child. But when the main character acts like a deer in headlights for 80% of the book, and has a few random and brief moments of god-awful one-liners boasting her perfection, it’s a turn-off. After the first instance of this, and the multiple continuances of her silly demeanor and confusing personality after, I became increasingly checked out. I almost DNF’d this book about 15 times, but kept at it because so many other readers were telling me how much they loved it. So I forced myself to keep reading…and reading…and…reading. In the end, they were right in some cases. It DID get better. But it wasn’t amazing and unforgettable. It was just okay. I really wish I could have fell in love with this story more, because the suspense was there. The mystery and grittiness were shouting through the pages, but I just couldn’t connect with November or any of the other characters for that matter. The romance element was lacking in that it felt shoved together rather than formed naturally, and the friendship between Layla and November felt stiff. I just wasn’t invested in this read at all, and for that I am truly dismayed.
3861404416	"Welcome to Academy Absconditi, November, where the scheming never stops, and where someone is always trying to push you off a ledge."Killing November (Killing November #1)by Adriana Mather My Review:I suspect this review maybe on the long side. This is one of those books I have many different feelings about.First off..highly recommended! I cannot stress that enough. This book was very exciting in many ways and is far different then your average YA mystery that I can promise you.November has grown up in a sleepy New England town. She's always been a trusting and outgoing girl. Her dad is an ex FBI agent and her mom died when she was young. November and her dad are quite close.So when her dad ships her off to an elite boarding school, November does not ask to many questions. And her dad says it will only be for a few weeks.That's all November remembers. Next thing she knows, she is waking up...in a..dungeon?Turns out she is AT this mysterious school. Only it isn't a conventional school of sorts. The students do not study academia. Their classes are in sword playing and poisons and mind games. Yes, there is an actual class in mind games and deception. (does sound a heck of a lot more fun then math.)So, November is cut off. Nobody tells her why she is there. The school allows no outside communications. And from the beginning November is being targeted by people(students) who seem to know her or at least her family. She is punched, she is threatened. What is going on?I do not want to say to much more in regards to the plot. I liked the book and am now determined to read every book this writer has written.In the afterword, the writer explains she DREAMT about this book and that is how it came to be! Wow. I am just...in awe!The reason I gave it a 3 (7 out of 10 if ratings were a 1-10 scale) is because I admit I had difficulties. It was a complex book that was difficult at some points to follow and understand. There is a feeling of frustration at least for me throughout, because the reader does not know what is going on for real until close to the end. And yet so much is happening that it makes it tough.The strength of the book and the reason I fell in love with this author's writing style is because she writes characterizations better than almost any writer I have seen. As November makes friends and we get to know the colorful cast of characters it is impossible, at least for me, not to get attached to them.I loved Layla and Ash. And my favorite..I am sorry but her name escapes me right now..was the girl with all the different accents. What a mischief making and fun character. I adored reading about all of them.This book took me longer than usual to finish and I am going to read part two. I think this will appeal to fans of YA who want something different. now spoilers:SPOILERS:Being a Strategia sounds like a heck of a tough life. I really dug all the classes and the look back on history. It is such an unusual concept. The writer has a brilliant mind.It sort of reminded me of the Divergent series a bit. I did enjoy this book and will not forget these people anytime soon. Love the Cover as well!
4114004634	4.5/5⭐ “He didn’t see the world for what it was, but for what it could be.” UNDERRATED YA MYSTERY BOOK ALERT!!! GO ADD IT TO YOUR TBR!I don’t know why this book isn’t more popular on booktok or booktube, it’s SO GOOD. I was expecting to like it, but not this much. It’s dripping with dark academia. The setting is a boarding school with people from all around the world, secret societies, family dramas, interesting classes like psychological warfare and archery, full of plot twists and fast pace. Is that not enough to convince you? Plot:November’s father sends her to a boarding school off the grid, with some mysterious students and interesting classes. November befriends her roommate, Layla, and her twin brother, Ashai. During her first days, she faces many challenges with other students and even finds a dead body… She has to figure out who these people are and why some of them recognize her and make her time at the new school insufferable. Layla and Ash help her figure out who she is while trying to find the murderer. “Welcome to Academy Absconditi, November, where the scheming never stops, and where someone is always trying to push you off a ledge. You’re in a dangerous situation. You’re taking calculated risks to get out of it. But risks are still risks.”These people are part of a secret society called Strategia, which she knows nothing about, but her family is a part of. It was formed by the advisers of the Persian king, the Roman emperor, and the Greek king. The three families. This secret society is responsible for being behind some major historical events throughout history, and she knows nothing about them. They also have some political conflicts between some families, and even though they try not to let politics be a part of the student’s lives, it has some impacts on the way they treat each other. The school offers many classes like psychological warfare, archery, poisons, dagger throwing… These are not normal students. They’re trained assassins, spies, politicians… anything. The students are out of this world smart, from being able to switch up accents to having perfect aim, enhanced physical abilities, and even reading people. This boarding school has really weird rules like not being able to share anything about yourself or the eye for an eye rule (someone punches you, you punch back) so it’s really hard for November to learn about other students and how she belongs there. The only thing I didn’t like was the info-dumping. When November went to the trees to meet up with Ash, he tells her the history of the families and what they do. It just seemed too much information for one chapter. Characters: It is one of the best parts of the book, I love all of them and their dynamics and personalities. -November: she mostly played clueless because she was for most of the book. But she didn’t let anyone bring her down and kept her chin up high. Even if she hadn’t been formed like the rest of the students, she’s good at archery (all the best characters are) and was trained at many things like climbing, knife throwing, and even fencing. She’s snarky and defends her friends. She’s too trusting with people she barely knows, but she has Ash and Layla to help her. She’s also really good at reading names to figure out where people are from and good at languages. “What you can do with names—piece them together and identify people with them? I can do that with body language.”“You never know how much time you have, so screw it—I’m going to live in every way I can.”-Layla: one of the best students at school. She seems cold at first, but soon befriends November and learns to trust her. She is incredibly smart and good at everything she does. I don’t think you understand my obsession with the twins… both of them are so attractive and smart, and their dynamic is so good. -Ash: in love with him. INTELLIGENCE IS SO ATTRACTIVE. This whole suspicious/mysterious vibe that he had going on was so good. He’s good at reading people, he knows when people are lying and what they’re gonna do next. Just by small changes in expression or posture... It's really impressive. He’s always protecting Layla and helps November by teaching her how to fight and with academics. -Inés: I love her. At some point, she says mierda (shit in Spanish), and based on what we know about the families, we have to infer that she’s spanish...so yeah that may be a reason why I love her. She doesn’t speak much and is shy. She reminded me of Inej from Six of Crows (not only because of the similar names) but Ines is silent and agile like Inej. And her loyalty to Aarya is 😊“Mierda,” Ines breathes, and I’m pretty sure it’s the first word I’ve ever heard her say.”-Aarya: obsessed with her. She’s good at switching accents, so no one really knows where she’s from. She seems cold and a bitch, but under her harsh exterior, she cares about some people around her like Ines and even Felix somehow. She is also really talented and good at everything she does, like Layla. One of the best students at the academy. “But Sanskrit is a dead language, not to mention that Aarya is a name given to both boys and girls. It’s funny how your name is changeable, almost like your accent. Maybe it’s even an alias?”“No one knows where she grew up. She’s impeccable with accents. The best in the school.”Romance: -Ash and November: (Ashember? Novash?) ATTRACTIVE, POWERFUL COUPLE COMING THROUGH. I saw it coming from the beginning, but it was still so nice. They got along pretty great from the moment they met. Ash, with his curious nature, wanted to know more about the new girl, and they ended up bonding. He saved her life when ____ tried to kill her and teaches her how to fight because he’s worried she won’t be able to defend herself. “I totally see what you’re doing, changing my words and then watching my response. I said you’re attractive, not that I’m attracted to you. There’s a big difference.” “Ash, you took a knife through the arm for me,” I say. “It’s a big deal. I can’t even tell you how…I would be dead if you hadn’t been there.” “We’re standing so close that my heart speeds up and I actually do look at his lips. “I saw that you know,” he says. I smile. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” “He looks at my lips. “I saw that, you know,” I say. “I know exactly what you’re talking about.”“Mad at you? November, I’m not mad at you,” he says, and pauses. “I’m worried about you. I…” He looks away. “I care about you,” he says, and his voice is quiet. “I care what happens to you.”“I don’t know what I would do if I lost you.” For a split second, he looks at my lips and I can see the question on his face.“Amantes sunt amentes.” Before I can work out the meaning, he smiles. “Lovers are lunatics.” He gently pushes his fingers through my hair and pulls me close. For a split second his mouth lingers an inch away from mine and his breath is warm on my lips. My stomach drops like I’m free-falling. “You ruined our first kiss,” I whisper. “Don’t screw this one up.” He grins. “I promise to practice constantly until I get better,” he says, and presses his lips onto mine.” -Ines and Aarya: I don’t care what anyone says. I better get this ship in the next book, cause they LIED to me. THIS was supposed to happen!!! “So Aarya does have a weakness. And it’s another person. I have to admit that I’m surprised.”“Does she care about Ines more?”“If I had to guess, I would say she does,” How can you say this and not let this ship happen? “You should care about her. That’s what friends do”FRIENDS?! You all should read this. Really underrated and so so good. I’m going to read the next one as soon as I can!!! I have some theories...
3622928873	Q: what kind of a school locks up their students? (c) The kidnapping one, obviously. That's what 'Academy Absconditi' stands for, duh.So, I've just read a book with a protagonist named September. Now, it's turn for November:Q: MY NAME IS November Adley and I was born in August. (c) This academy's big on being styled decidedly after Hogwarts:Q:“ ‘Historia Est Magistra Vitae,...“History Is the Teacher of Life—Academy Absconditi’s motto,... “The maroon means patience in battle. The silver means peace. The oak tree signifies great age and strength. The torch represents truth and intelligence. And the sphinx symbolizes omniscience and secrecy.” (c) They are all so OCD with all the 'secrecy' that it gets irritating right away. Paradoxically, their wordgames and the general paranoid mindfuckery seems to be fun (at least they don't get bored to death at that prep school):Q:Conner—deriving from cunnere, meaning “inspector,” and cun, meaning “to examine.” …Fléchier—French for sure, but also related to Fulcher in Old English, meaning “maker of arrows.” …Felix? By the way you emphasize the e in your name, I’m guessing you’re British?”... “Did you know your name means ‘lucky’ or ‘successful’? And Aarya, your name is actually Sanskrit for the goddess Durga, but it’s a common name in lots of countries.” … “But Sanskrit is a dead language, not to mention that Aarya is a name given to both boys and girls. It’s funny how your name is changeable, almost like your accent. Maybe it’s even an alias?” (c) The entrance exam seems to entail biting a pencil, eeesh! And some other weird shit, as well:Q:“Was that food you offered me okay to eat?”Conner turns around and pulls a small vial of something from his blazer. “The antidote,” he says, and smiles. (c) I'm grading it at 5 stars. Even though I probably should've docked quite a lot of points for a lot of stupid stuff. Still, it's a fun read even for all the eyeball workout I got out of it.Other fun stuff:Q:He claims the leaves shone so brightly in the morning sun that it looked like our front lawn was on fire. Dad also says that’s part of the reason I’m obsessed with the woods. (c) Q:He nods and jots down a note, which by this point in this bizarre conversation I would really like to see. (c) Q:“That one represents Aśoka’s most trusted advisor, that one Alexander the Great’s lover, Julius Caesar’s aunt, Cleopatra’s best friend, Akbar’s cousin, Peter the Great’s councilor, Genghis Khan’s strategist, and Elizabeth the First’s chambermaid. Need I go on?” (c)Q:“We’re not the most openly friendly bunch,” Felix says, like he prefers it that way.“Speak for yourself,” Aarya says. “I’m a hoot.” (c) Q:Cringeworthy stuff:Q:I’ve never met anyone with all the awkwardness of a debate club nerd and yet the physical appearance of an attractive pirate. (c) Whaaaat? Q:Gagworthy:Q:Ash gives us both a small bow as he slips back into the river of students, who behave more like spies than high schoolers. Up close his intensity is almost overwhelming, but as he walks away I find that it’s equally hard not to watch him. I’m not sure if I’m intrigued or intimidated. (c) Q;“Do you always stare at people with those laser eyeballs?” (c) No?
2674653574	KILLING NOVEMBER is a ya novel with a kick-ass female main character - November! November is in school which teaches poisons, deception, all types of fighting, and the rule is an eye for an eye. So begins a non-stop action novel. I highly recommend this book.

3278860429	CW: violence, murder Well that was a good young adult murder mystery with secret spy families that go back generations. The spy boarding school setting was a lot of fun and there was quite a challenging curriculum. The ways of being assessed were literally life threatening. The romance didn't feel too out of place and thankfully no excessive yearning occurred. It took a while for the story to pick up but I particularly enjoyed the family feud drama and look forward to seeing how that plays out in the next book.
3808985328	„Killing November“ von Adriana Mather ist ein spannender Thriller, den ich vor allem jungen Leser*innen empfehlen kann. ☺️ Die Protagonistin November hat mich mit ihren Fähigkeiten und ihrer Stärke positiv überrascht. Auch die anderen Charaktere sind sehr interessant und einzigartig gestaltet, das hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Das ganze Setting rund um das Internat hat der ganzen Geschichte Sache etwas Dunkles und Mystisches verliehen.Je weiter ich gelesen habe und je mehr Informationen die Freunde erlangen, desto spannender wurde es. Die (historischen) Machtspiele zwischen den verschiedenen Familien hat die Sache noch erwachsener gemacht.Ab und zu hätte ich mir ein wenig mehr Nervenkitzel gewünscht, an manchen Stellen fehlte mir die Schlüssigkeit.Alles in allem kann ich dieses Buch jungen Leser*innen empfehlen, die nach einem spannenden, aber nicht zu brutalen Jugendthriller suchen. 🥰
4846885395	i loved the idea and the premise of the book. mysterious boarding school with backstabbing students? count me in!!i liked layla and basically all the side character — even if they weren’t good people. they were developed well though so it made it nice to read.I LOVED ASH. and november? well she was clueless and too trusting and SO stubborn and kind of got on my nerves but i still liked her, especially as the book progressed
2771622741	I was really excited to read this book but i really could not get into it. The writing is weak and it really reminded me of early 2014 - 2015 writing (think Wattpad stories). The characters were two demential and had no actual depth to them. I just felt the story was trying to hard and I was not a big fan.
3650481908	4.25/5 :) I sink to the floor and put my hands in my hands. I’m so screwed. (114)A fast paced and intriguing read. I love all the action and deception that’s in this book, and the description of everything. All the characters are dynamic and have really different personalities. I can almost feel November’s confusion and frustration when she first got to this prison-like school. Can’t wait to read more about her and Ash in the sequel! Although i'm not quite sure how she knows where the students are from just by their names, because anyone can be named anything and it doesn't necessarily mean they're from a certain place that their name is from... That was not really reasonable in my opinion...I thought some parts were unnecessary and November made some dumb decisions but overall, this is a really good book. :)12/8/20━━━━━━━━━━━༻༻❁༺༺━━━━━━━━━━━"He’s throwing down a gauntlet- He’s powerful, he’s smart, and he’s after me."

3617557069	bendito sea este libro y todo lo que pasa en el. bendito sea el momento donde dije "me aburro quiero algo de misterio" y apareció ante mi como un ángel. Ash yo te amo, te sigo a todos lados. November es de los pocos personajes femeninos que amo con todo mi corazón y que su vida no se basa en chicos, gracias.
4558574110	This was so fun! Yes, I could nitpick details around plotting or characterization, but I just had such a good time reading this. If you are looking for a boarding school story with a murder plot and assassins that is a rompy good time, this will hit the spot. Will definitely continue in the series
2008008731	Адриана Мэзер "Скажи мне, кто я" (Скажи мне, кто я #1/2) 8,5 из 10Жанр: YA, триллерPOV: 1POV, от первого лица (она)Геометрия чувств: прямаяТеги: школа убийц, таинственные общества, убийство среди учениковРЕЦЕНЗИЯ:Что ж. Для начала признаюсь, что я с самого начала была необъективна к книге, потому что мне сразу же весьма и весьма понравилось описание, и я дала себе обещание не быть предвзятой. Ну, подумайте сами — закрытая таинственная школа, где подростков из самых влиятельных семей мира, тайно влияющих на самые важные события в мире, обучают искусству убивать, шпионажу, мастерству притворства и подражания — звучит изначально весьма сомнительно, но я люблю такое, люблю сериал «Deadly Class» и поэтому книга сразу оказалась на моем радаре.Собственно, нет никакого смысла говорить о сюжете, потому что вся суть дана в аннотации, и это все, что вам нужно знать. Вместо этого, я просто отмечу, что события в романе стремительны и захватывают с самого начала. Да, возможно где-то вы быстро обо всем догадаетесь, потому что некоторых штампов автору не удалось избежать, но менее атмосферной и захватывающей книга от этого не становится.Здесь есть романтическая линия (это ж YA, в конце концов), но она занимает далеко не самое главное значение, наоборот флирт между Эшем и Новембер весьма очарователен и к месту ровно настолько, чтобы дать искру, но не надоесть, а основной упор все же на обучение в школе и поиски убийцы. И это супер круто, потому что игры разума, обучение искусству определять ложь и изучение тайных событий истории, о которых не знают простые смертные. Адриана Мэзер сумела все это преподнести интересно и во все происходящее прямо верится.А еще, самое главное, Адрианы Мэзер поместила в историю очень харизматичных персонажей. Новембер вообще эстраверт, который не может жить без общения с людьми, видит все в ярких цветах и вся такая яркая, энергичная и живая – очень нетипично на фоне нынешних YA героинь, которые в большинстве своем замкнуты и стараются держаться ото всех особняком. Кстати хорошо раскрыты не только главные герои, но и второстепенные, Арья вон вообще моя любимица, с удовольствием почитала бы про нее отдельный спин-офф, офигенная девчонка.Подвожу итог. Легко, захватывающе, интересно и с нетерпением жду продолжения.
3628695594	Sağ gösterip sol vurdu resmen! Kurgu aşşşşırı iyi, karakter için aynı şeyi söyleyemem belki ama o da fena değil bana kalırsa.

Layla konusu da öyle. Vicdansız November oda arkadaşının başın neler gelmiş harekete geçsene 🙃Ve genç-yetişkin kitleye hitap ettiğini düşünürsek aşkı biraz daha görmek isterdim. Ash’in sonda söylediklerinden sonra o aşkın daha hissedilebilir olması lazımdı.Ama hiç sıkmadan kendini okuttu💅🏻 Zaten heyecanı hiç bitmiyor kitabın. Ekim ayına güzel başladık 😎
5259409715	✰ 4.25 stars ✰ “Either you’ve suddenly become a good liar or you’re telling the truth. I don’t know which is more unbelievable.” Killing November by Adriana Mather was such an exciting and entertaining read, that was filled with twists and turns with every reveal and action, that kept me going till the very end. November was a fun and believable character, one quick to trust, but still highly skilled in her talents. I am surprised that it's not talked about more in the YA circle, because I really enjoyed reading this. It was a very intriguing school mystery, but some reveals were a bit predictable, but it didn't bother me too much. The romance also didn't feel forced or rushed, and each of the supporting characters interactions with November makes me curious to see how these relationships will change in the sequel. I never felt bored at any place - the suspicion existing between November and her classmates felt very plausible and tangible, and I even appreciated the action scenes, which were both suspenseful and well-written.I'm always up for a good mystery, so I loved how Ms.Mather slowly revealed each bit of the puzzle, as November slowly figured out why she was at this school and who was out to kill her. The writing flowed, and I appreciated the careful balance between the tense moments and the light-hearted scenes where November's personality particularly shined. I'm super excited to see how the story will end, and hopefully that the sequel lives up to expectations. A fast-paced and thrilling story that was filled with high stakes and sometimes unbelievable risks but still made the entire read totally worthwhile. 👌 👌
2841963789	Killing November was intense, fast and fun. I pretty much devoured this story, because it is written in such a good style that the reader flies through the pages.The story follows November who comes to new school where everyone hides their true identity and she doesn’t know who she can trust.This was a fast paced novel, and it left me confused multiple times while reading. November wasn’t the most likeable character but I liked some side characters very much.Even though I had much fun while I was reading this, I don’t think that the story will stay with me long after I finished it.The sequel Hunting November comes out next year, but I am not sure if I’ll read it.

2423884256	Recently, I had the opportunity to read Killing November through an ARC tour. With several months to go, I look forward to reading this book again when it is released in March of 2019, as well as adding it to my personal collection. Many of you who already know me likely know that Adriana Mather is one of my favorite authors. Adriana has a way of writing her books in which her characters are so easy to picture. The voice she gives them and the settings she illustrates with her words truly make every book she writes an adventure to read. To say that Killing November is even better than her first two books would be an understatement, to say the least. Not sure what to expect from the cover and description alone, I jumped into Killing November half expecting to find similarities in the overall tone and style of writing. Not too surprisingly, this read was a breath of fresh air. As someone who loves books or stories with enjoyable characters, well written setting descriptions, and a good mystery element involved, this was right up my alley. Killing November opens with an introduction to what little we find out about the main character, November Adley, and apparently what little she actually knows about herself and her family. As I read the opening line which is, “My name is November Adley and I was born in August.” (p. 1), I was instantly drawn in. Firstly, by the unique character name, November, and secondly may be due to the fact that I was also born in August. It’s always more of an experience as a reader when you can find something relatable from the start. Adriana’s book starts out set in Connecticut where November lives with her father. We read a little bit about who November is, about her father, her aunt, and her best friend before it jumps to November finding herself whisked away on a plane to a mysterious, hidden, castle like boarding school in the middle of only the author knows where. While this initially gave me mixed vibes of something in between that new Sabrina show and Harry Potter, although there are speculations or subtle hints throughout the book, Adriana proved throughout that there are still many ways to take an idea so popular and make it new. This is one thing I loved, that the true location is left up to the imagination in so many ways. Maybe it’s in Maine where Novembers father says he spent time growing up, or maybe the hidden school is in Europe. When November first arrived at this school, she questioned everything and seemed to get off on the wrong foot with every single other character she met or came across. At the beginning, November was placed with a roommate named Layla and all she was told was a very specific set of rules that seemed impossible to live by. While the first couple of chapters were a little slow going to me, they are very important to understanding the entire setting of the rest of the book as well as getting to know a majority of the main characters. With some books, you end up having to wait until later on to meet important characters, but in this one, we meet them right away, but we don’t know why they’re important. As Killing November progresses, the main story line is that November is sent to this school, she has a roommate named Layla that she ends up becoming “friends” with along with her roommates brother, Ash. Without Layla and Ash, November would be the dead one, but instead, November and the others find themselves in a mess surrounding the deaths of others and trying to figure out what happened so that they don’t get mixed up in even more trouble. Little do they know, but November was sent to the school for a very specific reason that neither we or the characters find out until the end. To top this off, November also finds herself falling for Layla’s brother, Ash, which isn’t the smartest move. Fortunately, things do work out in the end, but not without a lot of fights, tragedy, bloodshed, and even sneaking around, romance, and tutoring lessons. November isn’t supposed to reveal it, but she doesn’t know why she is at this school or who she can really trust, so she takes some risks to find out more about her ancestry and history. To me, it makes perfect sense that this book would contain themes of ancestry and history because Adriana has built her career surrounding studying and researching her very own family secrets and history. Something I truly enjoyed about Killing November is the use of so many languages, cultures, and more behind the characters names, skills, and personalities. When November first wears her cloak she discovers a crest on it reading “Historia Est Magistra Vitae” which November finds out means, “History Is the Teacher of Life” (p. 17). Adriana uses her book and characters to share little nuggets of history, as well as lines that are quite quote worthy. Not only that, but there are even bits of humor spread throughout the book, which provides a great sense of comic relief considering the intensity overall. Every single chapter is filled with history, clever connections, character development, witty humor and sarcasm, and hidden messages and meanings. November ends up overcoming battles and wars with nearly all of her new classmates and she learns what it means to be a student at Academy Absconditi, as well as a part of her “family”. While it feels like it takes forever to finally get answers and understand the story as we are meant to as readers, in the end it’s satisfying to finally find out along with November more about who she is and why she got sent to this school. Even though in the beginning November feels alone and misses her home, her best friend, and her father and aunt, at the end she realizes the good and importance her experience has brought to her and knows she is ready for the next challenge that will be thrown at her. Personally, I do feel like the very end of the book was cliche in some ways, but I was happy about where the characters ended up and I am excited that the ending leaves us with anticipation and expectation for a sequel. Overall, I thought that this was another well written and enjoyable book to read from Adriana Mather. You can see an improvement in her writing between her first book and Killing November. Not only this, but while How To Hang A Witch and Haunting The Deep could be considered slightly more lighthearted, feel good types of reads with younger, less mature characters, Killing November is much more geared towards the older adults which is perfect for the older adults out there that still love to sit back with a great YA novel. Although it is still set around teenagers, the content is much more shocking and mature than Adriana’s past books and I think that this new story will draw in many readers looking for a book filled with mystery, intriguing characters, and the little bits of comic relief and romance necessary to keep readers of all sorts satisfied. “You analyze masterfully, but you also have egos. And if you allow your need to win to compromise your ability to truly oserve, then you have missed a great deal.” (p. 71). This quote is one of the best I found while reading Killing November. In between all of the plot pieces, I think that Adriana has also shared a great deal of wisdom and some wonderful quotes that can be taken out of context and applied outside of reading as well. Anytime I am able to find quotable quotes and words I feel passionate about sharing with others, I can safely say that it was a top read for me. I hope that you will all pick this up and enjoy it as much as I did, and I’m sure as much as Adriana also enjoyed writing it!

2677096533	I loved that while some parts were predictable-- understandably so-- it was still a fulfilling story in figuring out how everything tied together. There should be at least one surprise that people can't see because it has so many layers.I loved November as the main character. It was interesting to see the skills she excelled at that come in handy at her new school, while also seeing her fail miserable at others. She is great at the physical tasks but awful at the mind games; as someone who's the opposite, I liked being able to piece together some things before she did. While we get to know November really well, I enjoyed the mystery of "how does she fit in at this school?" and how it was developed.
5028509668	Idk it just like How to hang a witch with different people and scenary...I loved author's debut, said How to hang a witch but I don't want to read the same character with the same plot again. The writing was okay in thus one, the characters weren't that interesting in comparison.
4924671683	Posibles spoilers⚠️.Definitivamente este libro merece más reconocimiento porque es una joyita.Lo leí fraccionado en días así que me tomó un tiempo leerlo pero cada vez que leía un poco me enganchaba aún mas. Es un libro super adictivo, interesante, intenso y con muchos giros en la trama.Además de que tiene mucho misterio, y un poquito de romance, lo cual hace que me encante más ya que amo la combinación de los dos géneros. Y también me atrapó todo el rollo de la academia y los estrategia, habían muchos datos interesantes, especialmente en cada clase a la que iba la protagonista. Combinaban mucha historia y dstos que se me hicieron super entretenidos.Está demás decir que amé a la protagonista, a pesar de que de un día para otro cambió su vida por completo y se encontraba en un lugar completamente desconocido se hizo su lugar y no dejó que nadie le pasara por encima. November siempre mantuvo sus ideales y luchó todo el libro por sobrevivir y descubrir la verdad. Me encantó su personalidad, su carácter y forma de ver las cosas. Además de su humor.Los personajes secundarios también me gustaron mucho, creo que hay demasiadas cosas que hay para descubrir sobre ellos al igual que de la academia.Layla me gustó, al principio no me caía muy bien pero era entendible su actitud, más al tener en cuenta las reglas de la academia. Pero conforme avanzaba la historia, me encantó. Y Ash, que atrapó desde el principio, con su personalidad y humor. Además de como se relacionaba con November. Eran muy intensos y eso que mucho no pasó. En parte me esperaba su traición pero lo entiendo. Y el final ese, leerlos juntos y saber que van a una nueva aventura los dos y también con Layla es lo mejor.Por eso mismo espero pronto poder leer la continuación.Me hubiera gustado ver más de Arya y Mateo, creo que son dos personajes que esconden bastante y me intrigan mucho. En especial Arya con su personalidad. También ver más de la historia de November, pero supongo que en el segundo libro habrá más.El libro en sí es super interesante, me parece que sale de lo común con toda la historia de los personajes y ya de por sí por donde ocurre el libro. Durante todo la historia los personajes van pasando por distintas clases en las que tienen que mostrar sus destrezas y además descubrir quien está detrás de unos asesinatos sin ser ellos los próximos durante el proceso.Tw⚠️: Asesinato, violencia, sangre, pérdida de seres queridos, entre otros.
3641185192	Kurtlar sofrasına hoş geldiniz!Diken üstünde, her an her şey olabilcekmiş gibi kitap okunur mu derseniz evet okunuyormuş. Bu kitapta tam olarak bunu yaşadım. Sürekli her şeyden şüphelendim. Üstüne yazar önümüze kırıntı olarak attığı ipuçlarını buldum diye sevinirken, büyük lokmayı kaçırdım. Kitap resmen kedi fare oyunu gibiydi. Herkes sinsi, herkes sahtekar. Nereye dönsen kime güvensen sırtından bıçaklayabilir. Sanırım kitabı okurken yaşadığım gerilimi az da olsa hissetirmişimdir😂 Kitap November’ın daha önce hiç duymadığı bir okula babasının isteğiyle başlamasıyla başlıyor. Ama bu bildiğimiz okullardan değil. Nerede olduğu gizli tutulan, bıçak fırlatmadan akıl oyunlarına kadar eğitim verilen Absconditi Akademi. Akademi’nin birbirinden acımasız öğrencileriyle November’ı zorlu sınavlar bekliyor. Okurken sürekli gerildiğim üstüne heyecandan bir sonraki hamlelerini merak ettiğim kitaplardan biriydi. November’ın güçlü oluşunu ve her zorluğa karşı pes etmemesini çok sevdim. Güçlü kadın karakterleri her zaman okumayı çok severim. Kitabın başında başlayan gizem sonuna kadar hiç bitmedi. Sayfaları nasıl çevirdiğinizi anlamıcaksınız. Kitabı okurken sürekli kendinize şunu soracaksınız. Dost mu düşman mı? Çok severek okuduğum kitaplardan biri oldu. İkinci kitabı merakla bekliyorum 🐍
4132108135	Mein lieber Scholli....da geht was🤣....eine Mischung aus "Harry Potter" und "Iluminati"....!November wird von ihrem Vater zur "Sicherheit" auf ein mysteriöses Internat geschickt....wie sich herausstellt, geht es dort sehr ungewöhnlich zu....Geheimbünde, Schulfächer wie Giftkunde und tote Schüler lassen November verwirrt zurück.....bis sie erkennt, dass sie der Mittelpunkt aller Entwicklungen zu sein scheint....Rasant geschrieben, hervorragender Plot, ausgefeilte Szenerie, gut ausgearbeitete Charaktere. ...die tollpatschige November ist einfach köstlich....alles in allem ein wirklich gelungener FantasyJugendRoman!ABSOLUT lesenswert für gewaltresistente Menschen ab 15 Jahren!
5779136482	Sonunda bitirdim ya şükür kitabin konusunu çok beğenmiştim ve aksiyonlu sürükleyici bir kitap bekliyordum ama sıktı beni hiç sürükleyici değildi .
5048715405	“Geçmişi değiştiremem. Ama bu okuldan ayrılmadan önce yapacağım bir şey varsa o da Aslanları ve onlara göz yumarak Teşkilatın iyi yanlarını yok edenleri durdurmak olacak. Çünkü annemin, Ineslerin, Laylaların olmadığı, Brendanlarla dolu bir dünya cehennemden farksız. O yüzden ben, kendi adıma, direneceğim.” November, teyzesinin tehlikede olduğunu ve eski bir CIA görevlisi babasının bu durumu çözmeye çalışacağı birkaç haftayı Absconditi Akademi’de geçireceğini öğreniyor. Hayatı boyunca yaşadığı yerin bile dışına çıkmamış November için bu gelişme epey beklenmedik oluyor fakat kabul etmekten başka bir çaresi kalmıyor. Ve sonra Akademi’nin hiç de beklediği gibi bir yer olmadığını, hatta bu birkaç haftanın da hiç de öyle olmadığını öğreniyor. Dış dünyayla en ufak bir iletişimin hatta elektriğin bile olmadığı, zehirler, dövüş, bıçak kullanma gibi hiç beklemediği dersler almaya başlayacağı Akademi’ye gelişiyle neredeyse tüm öğrencilerin nefretini kazanıyor. Anlamlandıramadığı bu nefretin sebebini bulmaya çalışırken ailesi ve kendisiyle ilgili aslında hiçbir şey bilmediğini öğreniyor ve hem sorularına cevap bulmaya çalışıyor hem de onu öldürmek isteyen insanlarla dolu bu okulda hayatta kalmaya çalışıyor. Hem November’ın hem de diğer öğrencilerin düşünme biçimleri, işaretleri okuma konusundaki başarıları beni sürekli şaşırttı. Onlar her şeyden bir anlam çıkarttıkça hiçbir şeyin farkına varamayışımla kendimi kötü hissettim resmen😂November’ı aslında bir şeylere hazırlayarak büyüten babasının onu her şeyden habersiz bir şekilde göndermesini hiçbir mantığa oturtamıyorum cidden. Kız ne olduğunu anlamaya çalışırken sudan çıkmış balığa döndü resmen😬 bu kadar hazırlık yaptırıp yollarken bir şeyler de anlatsaydı diye söylenip durdum okurken😂Olaylar da gittikçe ilginçleşti kitapta. Her bölümle başka birini şüpheli koltuğuna oturttum, şüphelenmediğim kimse kalmadı sanırım😂 ve bu durumu da fazlasıyla sevdim açıkçası. Dikkati ve merakı sürekli diri tutan şahane kurgusuyla su gibi aktı gitti kitap. Her anını çok sevdim.🖤 Devamında neler olacak çok merak ediyorum, umarım bir an önce okuyabiliriz🤓
3707123412	4.5 stars. This book is SO good. Gives me all the dark academia vibes with a mystery!
3771874292	Messerwerfen, Giftkunde, Schwertkampf und Psychologische Kriegsführung – das sind nur manche der Fächer auf Novembers Stundenplan, nachdem ihr Vater sie ohne große Erklärungen auf ein Internat geschickt hat, das einzig und allein aus Geheimnissen zu bestehen scheint. Scheinbar völlig unvorbereitet gerät November an ihrer neuen Schule in eine Geschichte voller Mysterien, Geheimbünde und Familienfehden. Als dann noch ein kaltblütiger Mord die Mauern des Internats erschüttern, spitzt sich die Situation zu: Denn November ist die Hauptverdächtige.Ich habe gemischte Gefühle, was den Jugendthriller „Killing November“ angeht. Die grundlegenden Ideen haben mich fasziniert. Es galt so viele Geheimnisse aufzudecken, dass ich die Fragezeichen in meinem Kopf zwischenzeitlich kaum mehr zählen konnte. Ich wusste nicht, wo das Buch mit mir hinwollte, was ich von der Geschichte zu erwarten hatte und wie der Plot aussehen sollte. Das hat mir wirklich gefallen – zumindest anfangs. Doch als immer mehr Seiten vergingen, ohne dass auch nur ein Teil der Fragen geklärt wurde, siegte Ahnungslosigkeit über Spannung. Ich hätte gerne mitgerätselt und -gefiebert, doch diese Möglichkeit gab es eine ganze Weile kaum, weil selbst dafür der Input fehlte. Als die Geschichte dann richtig ins Rollen kam, endlich die ersten Hüllen fielen und Wahrheiten ans Licht kamen, hat mir das Lesen zum Glück wieder mehr Spaß gemacht, aber ein bitterer Beigeschmack blieb. Unter anderem wohl auch, weil die Charaktere dadurch für mich nicht greifbar wurden und die Emotionen verlorengingen. Ich muss zugeben, manche Gedankengänge oder Handlungen auch noch nicht ganz zu verstehen – aber „Killing November“ war ja auch nur der Auftakt einer Reihe. Ich könnte mir vorstellen, dass viele Sachen, die mir noch unschlüssig erscheinen, im zweiten Band mehr Platz bekommen und erklärt werden.Abschließend kann ich sagen, dass „Killing November“ mich trotz kleiner Mängel gut unterhalten hat und in einer Kulisse spielt, die mein Herz hat aufgehen lassen.
4698768880	If I had to describe this book in one word, it'd be entertaining. Because it was! This book wasn't anything super special or crazy good, and was cheesy at times, but I read it, I liked it, I had fun, and I was entertained the whole time, so I'll take it.Honestly, I kind of feel like this whole thing is like Spy School but leveled up with everything. It goes from mg to ya, from like fake classes with sucky teachers to actual deadly classes with super skilled teachers, from mildly threatening to deadly peers/villians, from 0 emotional maturity to- well, actually the people here weren't too emotionally mature either because they'd been emotionally suppressed their whole life, but you get the picture. But see, even the reason was better in this book. And I could go on and on, but basically, this book is Spy School with more going on and, in my opinion, more captivating and, you guessed it, entertaining.Also I'd just like to say that I guessed that X scar guy (view spoiler)[was protecting her. Although I guessed that her dad had somehow sent him to keep an eye on her, but close enough.I also got butterflies for every cute interaction we got between November and Ash, so that's worth something. I don't know, it was just really cute and I liked it everytime they bantered and kissed or almost kissed. (hide spoiler)]I think that's all for now, and I'm excited to read the next book! Sadly my library doesn't have it so I have to read it digitally :'(
2717879031	This was an entertaining and engaging boarding school mystery. November was raised in a quiet Connecticut town by her father and aunt after her mother died. Now seventeen and with her family in danger, she is sent to Academy Absconditi - a hidden and dangerous boarding school - where she learns many of the secrets of her past that the other students already expect her to know.Worst of all for November is that someone is either trying to kill her or trying to frame her for the murders of some other students. Though she has more physical skills than she realized she had, she is totally ignorant of the politics and rivalries here at the school which trains the best of the best of the Strategia secret society.She isn't totally on her own. Her roommate Layla and Layla's brother Ash are willing to make a deal to give her some information. Of course, trusting anyone in the school is dangerous. Everyone has an agenda that is hidden from November.I liked the worldbuilding that creates a secret society begun in ancient times, a society whose members have manipulated history for all that time. I enjoyed learning about the ins and outs and rivalries in the world along with November. I really enjoyed November. She was smart, gregarious, and trained by her father to think outside of the box. She'll need all her skills to survive her time at Academy Absconditi.
2022601587	This book is sooo mysterious. At first your like can this person be trusted since motto is like trust no one. Even thru the book its that. But this book is very fun intriguing story. Like come on a secret school. Also the thrill of the weapons and fighting ect. Sooo well worth the read and another amazing work by Adriana Mather and look forward to book 2
3594626829	(Possible 4.5???) Wow okay. First of all, I think this book is highly underrated and it singlehandedly got me out of a reading slump so thank you, Adriana Mather.This book was fast paced and incredibly confusing (in a good way because it peaked my interest). I really enjoyed being thrusted into this secretive spy/assassin world through the eyes of our main character that had no idea what was going on. I found myself eager to learn along side of her and loved the bits of history and family backstory that was included throughout the story.The murder mystery was a fun aspect and even though I had my suspicions about who the obvious culprit could be, it definitely didn’t hinder my overall reading experience.I did wish that the whole political aspect of the story was explored more and I was getting confused at times due to the wide cast of characters but I can tell that book 2 is going to explore this world a lot more in depth and I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to dive into a sequel so quickly.So 4 (almost 5) fat stars from me!
4816960924	4,5⭐️Sehr spannender Thriller mit coolen Schoolvibes, fande Layla und Ash, besonders Ash, sehr sympathisch. Hätte noch mehr Liebe dazu sein können, aber war für zwischendurch echt ein gutes Buch, das nicht Thriller Thriller war, aber trotzdem solche Züge hatte
3793235535	Ein Geheimbund von skrupellosen Intriganten. Familienfehden bei denen sogar die Montagues und die Capulets den Kopf einigezogen hätten. Dazu eine Schule, von der nichtmal die Schüler oder deren Eltern wissen, wo sie liegt und deren Unterrichtsfächer meist tödlicher Natur sind.Das klingt für Euch schon furchteinflößend? Dann stellt Euch vor, ihr geratet da ohne Vorwarnung mitten rein ohne eine Ahnung zu haben, was das alles zu bedeuten hat.Ich verliere ja selten ein Wort zum Cover – aber das hier gefällt mir nun wirklich nicht! Zum Glück ist der Titel und der Klappentext so verlockend gewesen, dass ich auf das Buch aufmerksam wurde. Ich verstehe nicht, warum einige Verlage so standhaft an einem Gesicht auf den Cover festhalten. Das tötet bei mir die Neugierde und schreckt mich meist sogar ganz ab. Der untere Teil des Titelbildes mit dem Symbol und dem Titel mit Blut geschrieben hätte mich sofort angesprochen!Doch zum Glück heisst es ja: „Don’t judge a book by its cover!“ und der Inhalt ist nun wirklich bis auf wenige Kritikpunkte richtig gut gelungen:„Mein Name ist November Adley und ich wurde im August geboren.“So beginnt die Geschichte der 17jährigen November. Ich bin ein Fan von ersten Sätzen – und dieser hier ist genial!November wächst in einem kleinen Kaff mitten im Grünen bei ihrem Vater auf. Alles scheint ganz normal, bis auf die Vorliebe ihres Vaters November das Messerwerfen und Klettern beizubringen… bis eines Tages alles ganz schnell geht und ihr Vater sie schnell in Sicherheit bringen muss. Zunächst denkt November noch, dass sie nur wenige Wochen auf dem geheimnisvollen Eltie-Internat bleiben muss. Seltsamerweise wird an der Academia Absconditi jedoch weniger wert auf Kultur gelegt, als auf Giftkunde, Strategische Kriegsführung, Klettern und Schwertkampf. Schnell dämmert November, dass dieses Netz aus Intrigen und seltsamen Todesfällen von nun an ihr Leben sein wird. Falls sie überlebt…Die Protagonistin November war mir stellenweise zu naiv. Sie wird im Buch eigentlich als Genie mit scharfem Verstand beschrieben und außerordentlichen Fähigkeiten die sie theoretisch allen Mitschülern überlegen sein lassen müsste . Doch gerade in der ersten Hälfte des Buches hätte ich sie soooo oft schütteln können. Sie stellt irgendwie nie die richtigen Fragen und handelt oft unlogisch. Das ändert sich in der zweiten Hälfte etwas, trotzdem scheinen ihr mehr Zufälle und unverschämtes Glück in die Hände zu spielen als ihr angeblich so scharfer Verstand. Davon abgesehen mag ich ihren Humor und ihre Schlagfertigkeit sehr.Ashai – der Zwillingsbruder von Novembers Zimmergenossin Layla – hingegen ist mein absoluter Favorit. Brilliant, Charmant und ein wenig eitel – der hätte mir auch sofort gefallen. Außerdem durchlebt er meiner Meinung nach die größte persönliche Entwicklung und ist von allen Charakteren am vielschichtigsten gezeichnet.Der Hintergrund dieses Buches besteht aus dem Konstrukt von Familien von Beratern und Ränkeschmiedern. Ich musste sofort an Varys von Game of Thrones denken. Verständlich dass dieses Organisation im Hintergrund – genannt Strategia – viel mächtiger war und noch immer ist, als die Herrschenden selbst. Die Idee, aufbauend auf historisch belegten Tatsachen und wilden Spekulationen gefällt mir fanatastisch.Allerdings halte ich es für sehr unwahrscheinlich dass diese Elitekids mit 15 schon genug über Geistes- und Naturwissenschaften, Kultur und noch vielem mehr gelernt haben sollten, um hier an dieser Academia Absconditi (verborgenen Akademie) nur noch die „besonderen“ Fächer wie Messerwerfen, Giftkunde, Klettern, Schwertkampf und Psychologische Kriegsführung zu belegen. Das Widerspricht meiner Vorstellung einer umfassenden Bildung. Ich kann mir kaum vorstellen, dass ohne die Grundlagen einer humanistischen Bildung solch feinsinnige Geister wie beschrieben dabei raus kommen und sich diese so raffiniert unter die High Society mischen können. Das ist ein Denkfehler, den ich weniger verzeihe. Man hätte die Akademie lieber als College für ältere Schüler aufziehen sollen und wenigsten ein paar andere Fächer dazunehmen sollen um glaubwürdig zu sein. Das hätten ja durchaus auch außergewöhnliche Fächer sein können, aber nicht alle sollten so archaisch sein.Das Ende ist für den Moment zufriedenstellend, jedoch nicht für einen Einzelband. Alles deutet auf Einzelband hin, kein Hinweis auf einen zweiten Teil im Buch oder auf der Webseite. Kein Wort davon, dass es eine Dilogie ist – durch Zufall habe ich das (zum Glück vor dem Lesen) online in einem Webshop entdeckt. In der Originalsprache gibt es bereits einen zweiten Teil. Wenn man den Kommentaren glauben kann, dann ist dieser auch der finale Band:Fazit: Grandiose Idee, gut umgesetzt aber stellenweise nicht zu Ende gedacht. Wenn man allerdings seine Kritikpunkte nicht allzu sehr weiterverfolgt, dann wird man ausgezeichnet von Killing November unterhalten. Wärs ein Film, dann fantastische Popcorn Kino – gibt es eigentliche ein begriffliches Pendant in der Buchwelt?

5475425610	✨9/10✨November serisinin ilk kitabı November’ı öldürmeyi bitirdim! 😍 MÜKEMMELDİ!! Tek kelimeyle bayıldım. Gerçekten çok keyif alarak okudum. Bayram boyunca elimden bırakamadım. Ana karakterimiz November, babasının onu çok gizli bir okula göndermesiyle hayatının aslında bir yalandan ibaret olduğunu öğreniyor. Sırlarla dolu, tehlikeli, cinayetlerin işlendiği Absconditi Akademisi öğrencilerinin teşkilata bağlı hanedan üyelerinden oluştuğunu öğrenen November, kim olduğunu keşfetmeye çalışıyor. Her şeyi çok sevdim, sadece işlenen derslerde bazen uzun anlatılan yerler hoşuma gitmedi. O yüzden 1 puan kırdım. Onun dışında HARİKAYDI! Hemen ikinci kitabı da okudum. 😍🥳
2893810552	When I first heard the description of this book my initial thought was 'YA Nevernight!' However after only a couple of chapters, it became very clear that November is essentially the antithesis of Mia. There are other parallels and similarities, but November is in a league all her own. Having been dropped into an academy of deception and violence thinking it was a prep school, November slowly learns her place and exactly what is expected of her. Making very few friends and a whole lot of enemies along the way, she shows that keeping an open mind and seeing things from a new perspective can be some of the most valuable tools of all. I greatly enjoyed the characters of this book and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel to see how the world expands beyond the walls of school.
2587827418	Killing November was such a pleasant surprise. I wasn't sure if I was going to buy it, but it's a June group read for TBR and Beyond. And I love books with boarding school settings.This is no average boarding school. November's dad decided to send November to a special school to keep her safe after her aunt was attacked. November's mom died when she was a young child. Her dad, aunt, and best friend are the only people she really has even though she's social. She doesn't know any of her family or much about them. Her aunt did tell her that she didn't like November's dad's family. November expects to be at the school for a couple weeks, just until the holidays.After boarding the plane, November next woke up in a strange place. She quickly realized that she was drugged and had no idea where she was. There weren't too many clues to what country, but she had a few guesses. Headmaster Blackwood explains some of the school rules. There is no electricity and no way to contact anyone outside the school The classes are not your normal high school classes. There are classes on weapons, poisons, how to read signs from people, etc. Everything that is either self defense or how to hurt someone. Blackwood said that the school goes with an "eye for an eye" type punishment. November's roommate is Layla. She's smart, not super friendly, and is quickly annoyed with November. But her twin brother, Ash, takes to November right away. The students are not allowed to share anything about themselves or their families. November has no idea about any of the history that all the students know. She's the talk of the school because no one comes into the school in the middle of the semester at 17. These students are all hand picked and special. November quickly realizes that there are some alliances, but not a lot of true friendship. Everyone is pretty rude and competitive. There are a few students that seem to already hate November even though she just met them. One says he knows who she is. While November is trying to figure out what this school is, she starts having flashback memories from growing up. The names and qualities her mom gave her stuffed animals seemed like make believe. But these terms come up in this school. Her dad's games actually taught her how to spy and think outside of the box. While November has no idea on the history, she still excels with some classes because of this.When November stumbles upon a dead body, things get really weird. Layla, Ash, and November try to figure out who killed the person and why. It looks like the murder is being pinned to November. And whoever the killer is, they will be killed since they go by that whole eye for an eye rule. I loved the mystery, pacing, characters, and all the cool spy and assassin studies. There is a little romance that I enjoyed, but overall, the book really focused on the families and their history.I gave this book 5 stars and can't wait for book two.
4002494566	Ya sabéis que yo no soy una habitual en Thrillers juveniles o thrillers en general, pero este libro lo he disfrutado una barbaridad 🤩🤩 Me ha encantado lo que he sentido al leer este libro porque hacia mucho tiempo que NINGUNO me hacía sentir así 😳 Solo tenía ganas de LEER, LEER Y LEER, y no parar hasta terminarlo. ¿Sabéis lo muchísimo que me llama la segunda parte, Cazar a November, desde la estantería? Ojalá poder leerlo YA 😱😱Me ha resultado un libro super ingenioso por la historia del origen y el pasado de las familias (ya me entenderéis cuando lo leáis, pero me ha parecido muy original).Nuestra protagonista es November, una chica de 17 años que de repente aparece en una especie de castillo 🏰 que resulta ser una academia. No sabe cómo ha llegado allí, por qué su padre la ha enviado o cuánto tiempo lleva inconsciente; pero, de repente, cuando se despierta todo es diferente a lo que esta acostumbrada ya que en la academia que la inscrito no es una academia normal. No hay clases de matemáticas, lengua, inglés... No, tienen clases sobre cómo manejar cuchillos 🔪 , arcos 🏹, venenos ☠️, para usar su mente diferente al resto y, cómo no, sobre cómo mentir sin que tu cuerpo o palabras te delaten. November no entiende absolutamente nada, pero entiende menos cuando una noche se encuentra, en uno de los pasillos, a un compañero de clase asesinado y alguien quiere endosarla el crimen. No conoce a nadie. No sabe en quién confiar. ¿Ha sido un alumno? ¿Los profesores también están involucrados? ¿Porqué hay guardias y no tienen permitido hablarles? Como podéis ver tiene una premisa muy llamativa y atrayente 🔥 Para mí este libro ha sido sorprendente y nada predecible. Además tiene muy buen ritmo a lo largo de todas su páginas, no hay nada de relleno para que se te haga lento o cuesta arriba; constantemente están pasando cosas y conoces algo nuevo sobre la academia y sus alumnos.Se lee rápido rápido, engancha y tiene una protagonista fantástica, fuerte y diferente. No quiero profundizar ni contar mucho más porque, al fin y al cabo, es un libro de misterio; y lo interesante aquí es intentar descubrir el misterio antes que nuestros personajes, ¿no?En resumen, os recomiendo mucho la bilogía de Matar a November a pesar de no haber leído (por el momento) su segunda parte, de la cual espero mucho mucho 😍Si os apetece un libro que enganche cosa mala o saque de un bloqueo lector y os gusta leer de vez en cuando libros con misterio/thriller/academia... este es vuestro libro.Y sobre todo, no os olvidéis de contarme qué os ha parecido si lo leéis gracias a mi recomendación 💕
1995387448	Initial Impressions 3/19/19: Another Goodreads fail where it's not noted that this is a series (any GR Librarians want to add that, please?) but thankfully I could see that coming and I actually do want more of this series, unlike other poor surprises I've had haha! I knew I wanted to read KILLING NOVEMBER from enjoy Adriana Mather's debut, HOW TO HANG A WITCH. I didn't really even look into what this book was about before I started it and just jumped right in! Basically it feels like Deadly Class, if anyone has been watching that SyFy show, but less 80s, less intentional killing, and a dash of the DaVinci Code. It was super entertaining and fun from start to finish!Review posted on The Book Addict's Guide 4/1/19: I absolutely loved Adriana Mather’s debut HOW TO HANG A WITCH and followed up with the book’s sequel so when I heard that she had a new book coming out, I knew I had to pick up KILLING NOVEMBER!If you’ve watched SyFy’s show Deadly Class, you may be the perfect audience for this book. If you haven’t, well obviously you can still enjoy it and maybe you’ll want to watch Deadly Class after this because I continued binge watching after I finished! KILLING NOVEMBER finds titular character November in a new, mysterious school after things are shaken up at home. November doesn’t exactly know how serious it is but she’s dropped in the middle of nowhere full of prominent badass/ninja/assassin/secret agent-type families (except they’re not allowed to talk about it) and she’s not entirely sure why she’s there, but we all know there’s some sort of reason!I loved the sort of mafia/assassin/secret agent feel in KILLING NOVEMBER, especially at a boarding school specifically for the families who work in this type of secrecy or espionage. It was such a fun read with a really fun concept, full of a great balance of the severity of the situation and levity at how weird it would be to be dropped there, plus some great character sass.I didn’t realize this was a series when I started it but thankfully this book has that sort of feel anyway! I could tell by the pacing that it was setting up for a series and I am totally here for it! There’s a little bit revealed in this book about the overall series plot and some little hints of things you see coming, but there’s still a whole lot more to explore and I can’t wait to see what happens next!
2829635980	When I saw this book the blurb had me intrigued and I really wanted to read. When my copy finally came in from the library, I was excited to read but sadly this book didn't work out in my favor. I couldn't connect to any of the characters and I felt the story went on and on and on and on for too long without any plot advancement. Everything was pretty much a mystery. November had no clue where she was and why she was here in the first place. She was also cut off from the outside world as well. Finally towards half the book we make some progress and things get interesting just to slow down again. From the way it ended I think there may be more books but I'm not sure if I will continue on with the series. I did listen to the audio as I read and the narrator did such an excellent job. If I'm being honest the narration is the only reason why I stuck with the story.
2654686187	I enjoyed this book way more than I expected to enjoy it when I picked it up. Initially, I thought it would be a good read for my students, who like thrillers. I expected to skim through, find it acceptable and move on. Instead, I totally got sucked in to this book. A lot of it was predictable, but this was just so much fun to read. The pace goes very quickly from start to finish, and I liked the characters quite a lot. There could have been more development, and information reveals sometimes wound up piled on top of each other. In spite of that, I'm already anticipating the next book (which must be forthcoming, judging from the ending).
2571340662	So once again Adriana has done it. I’ve cried, I’ve laughed and I’m left wanting more. Murder, weapons, poisons and everything is deathly. I loved every single moment of it.This is another masterpiece and I’m ready to reread it, the plot, the twists and turns kept me doubting my own detective skills and once everything is laid out on the table all the pieces come together in a beautiful way and you’re left mouth open and crying. I found myself frustrated with November and at times had to put the book down so I could calmed myself. If you’re a mystery fan you’ll love this book.
3212033404	J'ai adoré ce livre, beaucoup plus que je ne le pensais ! Même si certaines révélations étaient prévisibles ça n'a pas affecté ma lecture DU TOUT. L'évolution de November sur ces 400 pages est progressive et complètement crédible. Je crois qu'il n'y a pas un personnage que je n'ai pas aimé et ça c'est très très rare. Je met de ce pas le T2 dans ma wishlist parce-que je veux essayer de le lire rapidement, pour ne pas oublier les détails du T1.
2583898004	From the medieval setting to gothic decor, once November arrived at International Academy Absonditi I was hooked.I enjoyed getting to know each of the characters especially Ash.Adriana has created a secret world that sucks you in and you can not wait to turn the page to find out where it will take you next.I cannot wait for the next book to come out to see where the series take us!
3099755703	Quel coup de coeur ! J'ai adoré l'ambiance, les personnages, l'intelligence et la construction de l'intrigue .. D'ailleurs elle est parfois un peu prévisible (sur certains éléments) mais ça ne m'a pas gênée parce que j'étais à fond dedans ! Bref, un gros coup de coeur !
3221784836	November es una chica de 17 años que vive en Estados Unidos y ama su pequeña ciudad y familia. A pedido de su padre irá a la Academia Absconditi por algunas semanas, pero lo que encontrará no podría sorprenderla más. En un lugar oculto, donde no existe la tecnología, existe una Academia donde las reglas normales no existen. Los estudiantes toman clases sobre como usar venenos, manejar armas y mentir, sobre todo, mentir. Cada uno de ellos proviene de familias prestigiosas del mundo, y todos serán los futuros espías y asesinos de sus familias, por lo que November no comprende que hace ella en ese lugar, pero no tendrá mucho tiempo para averiguarlo ya que un compañero aparecerá asesinado y ella será acusada. Pronto se convertirá en el objetivo de varios estudiantes que buscarán matarla, y tendrá que descubrir primero que hace allí y segundo, como salir del problema en el que está metida. Opinión personal:La verdad que me he sorprendido muchísimo con este libro ya que al principio me daba un poco de miedo que fuese una historia predecible, pero por suerte no fue así. Como saben para mi el ritmo de un libro es algo que puede hacer que me enganche o lo deteste, y en este caso sin duda fue todo un éxito! Es una historia en la que pasa de todo, se lee extremadamente rápido y me encontré sin querer soltar el libro. Comenzamos la historia llenos de interrogantes que se irán resolviendo a lo largo del libro, pero la forma en la que la autora nos va dando pistas para ir identificándolo me pareció increíble. En principio todo parece desordenado, pero las piezas de a poco van cayendo en su lugar y sin duda nada fue dejado al azar, y los detalles históricos llevados a eventos del presente de los personajes me parecieron un toque genial. En cuanto a los personajes me gustaron porque se alejan 100% de los típicos adolescentes. November en particular es una mujer fuerte e inteligente, capaz de conectar lecciones de vida que podrían parecer totalmente mundanas y ver el mensaje escrito entre líneas en ellas. Me gusta porque es un personaje que piensa totalmente fuera de la norma, es fresca y llena de ideas, y, a pesar que si hay varios capítulos en donde ya quería que deje de quejarse porque la gente no era como la de su vida normal, creo que todas las salidas en donde utiliza su creatividad compensan totalmente ese detalle.En cuanto al resto de los personajes me gustó mucho como la autora los hizo relacionarse entre ellos. En una escuela llena de futuros asesinos, la moneda de cambio que vale es la información que puedan conseguir del otro para tener alguna ventaja sobre otros, y claramente hay muchísima información que conectar en esta novela! Hay mucho que me gustaría decirles, pero creo que, una de las mejores cosas con esta historia es que el lector pueda ir sacando sus deducciones para descifrar el misterio, y admito que yo no pude. Definitivamente sospeché por donde venía la resolución pero no pude estar más lejos de lo que en realidad pasó al final. Eso sin duda habla de una buena construcción de la historia ya que no me permitió adivinar que sucedería.En resumen, lo recomiendo? Si! si les gustan los libros que tienen un buen misterio, ritmo rápido y personajes fuertes, sin duda pueden disfrutar de esta historia. Eso si, aclaro que tiene bastante violencia física, definitivamente hay muertos, cortes y peleas, pero no me han parecido grotescos ni fuera de lugar, pero eran totalmente necesarios para darle sentido a la historia, después de todo, es una escuela de asesinos jeje.
3794001303	Normalerweise lese ich fast nur Fantasy oder Romance, von daher war dieser Jugendthriller wirklich mal was anderes für mich. Und ich muss sagen, ich bin absolut positiv überrascht! November von ihrem Vater überraschend auf ein Internat geschickt, welches von einem Geheimbund regiert wird. Ein Mitschüler wird ermordet und auch sonst passieren immer mehr mysteriöse Dinge... Man wird komplett ohne Vorwarnung in die Geschichte hineingeworfen und ist dabei genauso ahnungslos wie die Protagonistin November selbst. Und genau das macht irgendwie den Reiz des Buches aus. Denn man kann sich absolut in sie hineinversetzen und weiß zu keinem Zeitpunkt mehr als sie. Meine Gedankengänge beim Lesen waren definitiv ähnlich zu Novembers. Ich war ahnungslos, verwirrt, schockiert und noch so viel mehr. Teilweise war ich fast schon wütend, dass ich so lange im dunkeln gelassen wurde. Ich hatte lange absolut keine Idee, was da vor sich geht und wer hinter allem steckt und die ganzen Wendungen und Ereignisse machten das Buch unglaublich fesselnd. Ich konnte es nur sehr schwer aus der Hand legen und hatte zu keinem Zeitpunkt das Gefühl, dass es langweilig wurde. Das Setting des Internats hat mich tatsächlich ein wenig an Harry Potter erinnert, mit dem Unterschied, dass es dort keinerlei Magie gibt. Als Leser kann man sich die Atmosphäre an der Akademie richtig gut vorstellen und besonders gut haben mir auch die recht detaillierten Beschreibungen der einzelnen sehr besonderen Unterrichtsfächer, wie zum Beispiel Giftkunde oder Schwertkampf, gefallen. Auch der Schreibstil an sich ist wirklich angenehm und das Buch ließ sich sehr flüssig und leicht lesen.Das einzige, was ich mir noch gewünscht hätte, war ein bisschen mehr Komplexität sowie wirkte es teilweise ein wenig unlogisch, dass man so viel erst so spät erfährt. Insgesamt hat mich das Buch aber wirklich toll unterhalten und macht definitiv neugierig auf den zweiten Band. Also, wenn ihr auch Lust auf eine geheimnisvolle und fesselnde Geschichte zum selbst miträtseln habt, dann kann ich euch das Buch absolut empfehlen!4,5/5 Sterne
4889724065	1.5 stars but I don't feel generous enough to round it upWHY did I return to this book? I found it so annoying! Well, I needed something brainless to relax to. That ... didn't really work out because some aspects of this book made me so mad I couldn't relax and just "let it go".By "mad" I mean "roll my eyes out of my head" mad.A very "me" reaction, yes, I know.In case you hadn't already guessed, this is my favourite gif in the whole, wide world:When I try to think about what I liked about this book I actually draw a complete blank. My list of things I didn't like, however, is really long:💢 This book is basically a bargain knock-off of Nevernight , set in the modern world (sort of). However, November certainly isn't another Mia and that's painfully clear throughout the entire story.💢 The school wants to be Hogwarts - but a deadly sort of Hogwarts. (Wait, where did I already see this setup? Oh, right. Nevernight!) Instead of Slytherins, Gryffindors, and so on, we get to tag along with a bunch of "families" (that by all accounts should suffer from inbreeding by now - if the author had actually taken a moment to think about the setup for more than five seconds). Lions, Tigers and Bears (oh my!) and Wolves and whatnot. All that's missing is a cute little house mascot. *eye roll*💢 Apparently being some sort of super secret superspy/assassin/whatever requires you to be really, freaking good at climbing TREES. As if most political issues don't take place in cities nowadays and ambushes in Sherwood Forest was still a thing. *insert another eye roll here*💢 No modern weapons training. Because ... uhm ...? There are no guns in Nevernight? (Seriously, this is my best guess for not including anything modern in the kids "super" training.)💢 November has learned some things before entering the school, but nothing as "basic" as fighting. This is explained very late into the book by her dad telling her in a flashback that she should learn to fight "her way" instead of learning a certain kind of martial arts and being "predictable". And yet... November can't even throw much of a punch at one point, early on, and has to take lessons from a fellow student to learn such a menial thing as hitting people. (She's really great at fencing and throwing knives and CLIMBING TREES though!) Makes sense? No, it bloody doesn't.💢 November is The Choosen One. Very much like Harry Potter, she's basically the Very Special Child that could Potentially End All Evils. Oh, AND of course she's also the child of Romeo and Juliet. But she has NO CLUE of this, of course, because her dad didn't even see fit to tell her enough to potentially survive in the wild if something happened to him.Since he's supposed to have been the best 'effing student of all time (OF COURSE), alongside his wife, this makes absolutely zero sense. A well prepared child, armed to the teeth with knowledge instead of vague bed time stories about jackals, lions, tigers and bears (oh my!), would have made sense.💢 Nothing in this book makes much sense. The school doesn't use electricity and all kids are forced to adapt to some sort of Medieval type of living - where even the maids have bonnets for some asinine reason. The only thing that would have made at least a little sense in that kind of setting would have been security cameras and locked doors. Instead we have "curfews"... In a place where the kids are supposed to learn to be super badass. Yeah.Great idea.*eye roll*💢 Every character possible has a name that suits them oh, so well. It's as if Snape in Harry Potter had been named "Shady McSlyface". And just as silly as if he had been named just that.November has the same ability as an encyclopedia (or a "chose your baby's name" site) to figure out everyone's names and their meaning(s) - and for some ~magical~ (read: unrealistic as Hell) reason, all characters have a name that plays into their nature, work or other convenient reason. It was a bit charming at first, but then it started to piss me off because how on Earth could November know all the names in the world and yet not seem to know much about languages in general? It seemed like the dumbest, most niche sort of knowledge to have. Practical use in real life: NONE. Unless you happen to have clairvoyant parents who named you something really clever that correlates perfectly with your future self, background, work, and ... so on. 💢 The thing that made everything worse: The narrator. She sounds like a grating cartoon character in the worst possible American way. I felt sorry for her vocal cords all the way through the book - and my eardrums sort of bled a little throughout the entire book. But her non-American accents were so, so much worse.Every time she totally botched an accent my ears wanted to vomit. One character in the book has a quirk where she switches accents all over the place to make it impossible for anyone to pin point where she's from - which is 50/50 sort of fun and impossibly annoying. (A neutral English accent would have made more sense, but "sense" is something not found in this book.)Anyway, it's a big thing that she's always pitch perfect and spot on when switching accents. Yet, the narrator can't even fake a British accent to save her life!!!! Or French. Or Italian. Or Russian. Or Egyptian. Or anything outside of the US. (To be fair, she aced the "cowboy accent".) I have no formal training as a voice actress what so ever and I could have done better after just a week of practice, in all honesty. It made me cringe so hard. ▪️ Now, we get to the bottom line here:Will I listen to book two?No. I don't care about November enough to see how this story works out.
2749451597	I got such a kick out of this book. It’s just cool girls who kick butts, take names, and will put you in the ground if necessary fun!November is a heroine you can relate to. Yeah, she’s YA-Trite-The-One, but she’s also pretty normal and funny. She’s kind of like the Buffy of her world.As for our other characters, like em or loath em, they’re a whole lot of fun!I’m so on board for this series and can’t wait for book two!• ARC Provided via Net Galley
2026165618	Rating: 4.5 StarsFor centuries, a handful of families have been orchestrating some of the biggest historical events. Welcome to the Academy Absconditi, where the children of these elite families come to train and perfect their skills in things, such as: strategy, mind games, subterfuge, knife throwing, climbing, and sword fighting.When a "family emergency" arose, November was whisked off to this top secret boarding school in an undisclosed location. Little did she know, this was not your average school. Not only did November hone her skills and learn the secrets of her family while at the Academy, she was also forced to fight for her life.Well, THAT was an unexpected and fantastic surprise! I had loved both of Mather's previous books, and though this one was quite different, it was equally as fabulous and entertaining as the others.I was quickly wrapped up in the world of the Academy and the Strategia, who are the ruling families. Their connection to prominent world events and how they manufactured them was the stuff conspiracy theorists' dreams are made of. As always, Mather wove lots of interesting historical tidbits into the story, and I was utterly fascinated by the events she chose, as well as how she blended them seamlessly into this tale.I also loved going to class with November. What they learned and how they learned it was so interesting, but at the same time, terrifying. The Academy dated back to the 1030s, and still subscribed to many archaic rules of justice. Students were punished by being thrown in the dungeon or having to suffer "an eye for an eye" consequence. There was one scene, which was especially savage. I just couldn't believe the culture of this school.Yes, the Academy was quite an intriguing place, but it was also a place, where you had to constantly watch your back, as November quickly learned. One of the biggest mysteries, which was solved by the end of the book, was who was trying to kill November and why. I was definitely keeping my eyes wide open as November and the twins, Ash and Layla, attempted to solve the mystery themselves. Lots of action, lots of lying, lots of precarious situations -- Mather really kept me on my toes.The characters, the action, the alliances, the history, the mystery -- I was onboard for it all. I did not realize this was a series, when I selected this book, however, I am now pretty excited about it, because I am itching to learn all I can about the world of the Strategia.*ARC provided in exchange for an honest review.

2507787904	I've been a huge fan of Adriana's ever since I first picked up HOW TO HANG A WITCH and it's sequel HAUNTING THE DEEP, but she has stepped up her game like nobodies business. KILLING NOVEMBER is by far the most unique and entertaining book I have ever read. This gave me everything I wanted and so much more. Does anyone remember the film from the early 2000's called "The Skulls" starring Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker? Just Me? Cool. It could be the whole Secret Society vibes that keeps me thinking back to this film, but to me this book took the dark twisted suspense from that movie and amplified it to the max. If you love Secret Societies, Political Intrigue, Suspense, History, and Pop Culture References, than this is the book for you! I also loved getting to slowly know all the amazing cast of characters from November (or how I love to call her, Nova), Ashai, Layla, or even Aarya (who secretly became my fav side character). Every time one of these characters or one of the many others would appear in the story it would add even more layers to the story. Also every time a Historical event was mentioned I found myself being pulled in even more. It gave the story more depth and made it seem more realistic. I also want to note that I have not screamed at and agreed with a main character like Nova in a long long time. She had my anxiety going crazy, but in the best possible way. I definitely can't wait for the sequel to come out!!!! Also I want to note one of my new fave OTP's is Aarya and Ines (even if it will never become a thing) and no one can stop me!!!!!
3784117399	2.5 STARSI just finished it now and it was bad. first of all, the writing style was confusing, and at a point, I had to skip a few pages(which I never ever do) because it was getting really really boring, the plot was great but the execution was very bad, the author didn't make me care about the characters at all and because of that I stopped caring about the plot at well, I wasn't paying any attention to the other characters and the names OH MY GOD!!, they were the most confusing thing in this book. the only parts I enjoyed were the classroom parts and around the 50% to 60% point and the rest of the book was boring. The characters were very flat and I don't remember anything from the story anymore. This wasn't even thrilling. I expected a heavy amount of spies and assassins stuff and I did get it but I wanted more, ok, there is not a lot of spies and assassins related stuff going on, then the murder mystery is going to be focused on, right? KINDA but the murder doesn't happen till I was 50% in the book. and also it has good plot twists but when it came I was like "oh, ok, fine" and half of the book was just.........It didn't work out for me. DO I THINK THIS IS A BAD BOOK? no...this is not at all a bad book but the writing style, execution, and slow-paced, unlikable characters didn't work out for me at all.WILL I READ THE SEQUEL?No, I will not unless I feel like doing something stupid.
2634872793	Adriana never ceases to blow me away with her unique world building! This book was AMAZING from start to finish! The character building with each individuals quirks and distinct personalities, the mystery with twists and turns- this had me at the edge of my seat from the very beginning and I loved every second of it! I started reading this book around 6pm and didn’t stop reading it until close to 4am the next morning hahaha!! I love that Adriana has such a knack for building these strange new worlds that border right on the edge of what we see is normal and she does it so flawlessly by mixing in so many historical truths! A secret society with a mysterious school for training their young for combat and espionage? Count me in! I really can’t wait to see what the future holds for the main characters!! This book has a little bit of everything and is a win for every genre lover! Mystery, thriller, romance, YA, historical fiction....it’s got it all! Another win for Adriana Mather- her first two books in another series already made me a fan and I really hope there’s a lot more of Killing November because this new series is off to an amazing and riveting start!
3361777298	the title is cooler than the actual book💀main character: typical dumb snowflake (her stupidity was funny in the beginning when everybody was acknowledging it, but then she started being praised for it, bc of course she's special and superior in her own foolish way, how could i think otherwise)💀mystery: extremely predictable even for a slow reader like me💀romance: insta-lovey 💀concept/world: unconvincing (and europe centered, which is enough reason for me to hate it)
3106660479	Abandonné : page 131.Arrivée à un tiers du livre et il ne se passe RIEN. On n'a aucune réponse à nos trop nombreuses questions. Et les brèves tentatives d'explications historiques ne tiennent pas la route au niveau des dates : "l'empire grec" n'a jamais existé (c'était des cités-états), et l'empire perse achémenide (chute vers 330 avant J.-C.) n'a jamais été contemporain de l'empire romain (ayant débuté en 27 avant J.-C.).Non, là c'en était trop.
2576072402	Absolutely loved this book and could not put it down!! What I really loved about this book is the intrigue of a secret society, a school steeped in history and mystery. I can’t wait for the next book in this series!! Adriana has outdone herself again, if you are a fan of How to Hang a With & Haunting the Deep, this book is for you!
2781409808	Think of the Harry Potter setting and school, but for Hunger Games families. A strong young adult theme, with a few cliche moments but for fans of YA and a bit of conflict, this one will do it for you. The requisite challenge of skills/tactics, relationships and someone out to unbalance everything. 4 stars for those that enjoy YA/mystery but only a 3 star general read.
6974221510	two stars only because it’s november, and this dumb girl’s name happens to be november, too. hah, what a coincidence.
2609778274	First off I would like to thank the author, the publisher, and NetGalley for giving me the chance to read and review this ARC. Please note that the version I read was an advanced copy, and certain events/language may be changed in the published edition. While the copy was provided for free, all opinions are honest and my own.In Killing November, November Adley must learn to navigate a new school, but it’s unlike any other school. It’s hidden in a place no one knows of and trains its students, all elite children of secret Families, in the arts of deception, battle, and secrets. November is thrown into this world without ever having heard of it and must figure out how she fits in, fast. After all, it seems someone is trying to kill her.This is my first book of Mather’s, though I have wanted to read How To Hang A Witch for a while. When I was accepted for this ARC, I was so intrigued by the synopsis that I started it almost right after being approved. Unfortunately, while this book was far from a bad one, I never truly connected with it.On a structural level, this book is a pretty good one. The world itself is decently constructed, with explanations for almost everything. While you’re still left with lots of questions of how things work, you know enough quite quickly to understand what’s going on. There were a few moments of major info dump, but generally, November learned about the world around her slowly, gleaned from little hints dropped by her peers. It led to an easing into the chaotic and complicated world of the Families and Strategia, meaning there was no point where I was too confused or overwhelmed.Additionally, the plot itself is pretty decent too. This book is dipped heavily in the idea of secrets, betrayals, and hidden plots, and it delivers on these promises pretty well. Even though you’re told not to trust anyone, the way the characters are written and sold to the main character still leads to November, and the reader, trusting and writing off the wrong people. While one of the twists was fairly easy to spot from early on, most of the other twists and turns were cleverly hidden. Lastly, all the puzzle pieces clicked together quite neatly, which is an important aspect of this book. It sells the idea of deception and reading others so much that if the book itself had been unable to accomplish that itself, it would have fallen quite short. Like I mentioned above, the characters are also quite well written and planned, continuous even through the reveals of their various ‘faces.’ And while there are a few “tropey” characters, the book tries to spin these tropes and assumptions that come along with them on their heads, leading to an interesting ending. However, I did have a few issues in this category as well. Firstly, the romance of this book was pretty insta love. It was also just your standard YA romance, in the first book the characters start liking each other and by the end, they’re willing to do anything for the other, even at the cost of themselves. In a story like this, I felt like this made even less sense than usual. Secondly, November was a hard character to pin down, especially at first. She is shown entirely clueless at some moments, and other times extremely skilled in odd arts like knife throwing and archery. While this is all explained later and through her memories, it makes it hard to connect with her as a character at first because you feel as if you don’t really know her at all. And once you’ve missed that initial chance for connection, you don’t really get another, which led to me being distanced from the characters and therefore the consequences of certain events.Lastly, I’m not necessarily that into where the series seems to be going. We seem to be leaving the boarding school to move into a larger, save the world/save the society plotline, and I’m just not sure how well that will fit with what we’ve seen of the characters and the world so far. However, I may still end up continuing the series, but we’ll see!

Check out my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...*I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review*3.5/5 Stars After a scare in the family, November is sent to a secret boarding school called Academy Absconditi. Here, the students learn knife throwing, poisons, stealth and other skills needed to become assassins and spies. November doesn't understand why her father chose to send her here, as she doesn't seem to fit in with anyone. When a student turns up murdered one night, November must determine who to align herself with and who to avoid. This was a fast paced and fun read, one that you don't really need to put a lot of thought into while reading. November was an okay character, although at times I think she suffered from the special snowflake trope. For over half the book she is completely naive, and no one will tell her anything about who she is and why she is at the school. But then all of a sudden she finds out everything all at once, it just didn't make much sense in my opinion. I also found the way she broke down everyone's names to figure out things about them was really annoying... I did like how you never really knew who November could trust and who she couldn't. I also enjoyed learning the backstories for all of the Strategia families within the academy. Overall, I think it was fun while it lasted, but definitely trope heavy.
6381394867	I could have loved this. Unfortunately, there were just too many players convoluting the plot, and since they were all so wooden they were easy to forget or mix up. I could only keep about 10 of the characters straight in my mind so a lot of the story just went over my head. I loved the concept of teens being trained as spies and assassins, but you can't puzzle out the mysteries on your own because you're following a clueless lead who has to have everything explained to her in tedious info-dumps.And on a personal side note, I WAS trained as a spy, and the notion that fake accents could replace languages IS LUDICROUS and really infuriated me. 😂 It only takes 6 months for a spy to be trained for fluency in a simple language like Italian, a year and a half for a more difficult one (mine was Korean). The only foreign languages mentioned in this book are French and Italian. You can't tell me that in the age of computers and global connections the author couldn't find someone to accurately translate a few phrases. Characters were explaining everything else to the MC, so why not translate, too?Off my soapbox. The audiobook narrator was very decent and Aria the Sociopath was my favorite character. (NOT because of her accents, obviously.) Someone please spoil book 2 at least as far as telling me whether or not she's in it. XDThis one's purged.

3320529228	I finished reading KILLING NOVEMBER the other night, and really need y'all to read it now. Instead of an unreliable narrator, everyone else in the book is unreliable and our honest-to-her-core protag needs their help.Assassin school. Murder mystery. Knives. So good.
2742453923	Before Killing November, I hadn't read anything by Adriana Mather, but now I'm looking forward to more!This story gives a different and refreshing take to YA Mystery involving a school to train spies and assassins. I was intrigued from the start, mainly because there aren't many details concerning November nor the school she's attending. She doesn't even know anything about the school, her family, the politics surrounding the students, etc. Since November woke up at the school, with no recollection of how she get there, she's instantly wary of everyone and gets on the wrong foot with a lot of the students. I have to admit, the story dragged on a little bit and at times, I wanted to stop reading, but I'm glad I didn't. The plot and the characters are quite unique. I loved how the author introduced every character in the story from the beginning. True, I had no idea what their role would be, which is what made the story more interesting.The majority of the book is spent learning everything about the school and the politics surrounding it, which is needed to understand a lot of what happens, especially the killings. November, along with the few friends she made, start investigating who could be killing and what is their motive. Once the pace of the book started picking up, I couldn't stop reading! Mather's writing style is so descriptive and simple that I felt like I was watching a movie in my head. I also loved the witty conversations, the humor, all the sass and sarcasm coming from November and Ash. Overall, this was a surprisingly good YA Mystery! I loved the history that Mather added to the story. It kept things moving and super interesting with all the clues it would add to the story. I can't wait for the second book! While it didn't really end in a cliff-hanger, it did left an opening to find out more about what is going on with this academy, politics, history and the people involved with it.
2788004094	"Welcome to Academy Absconditi, November, where the scheming never stops, and where someone is always trying to push you off a ledge."I loved Killing November! This book is about November, who winds up at a boarding school for children of strategists (spies, assassins, etc.) mid-semester. I will pretty much always be hooked in by a boarding school story, and this one did not disappoint. My only complaint was the name stuff - there's a lot having to do with the root origins of names, and it got old after a while. I kept hoping it would fade out, but no, it continued through the entire book.I loved figuring out the mysteries of what was going on in this book, and I liked the characters, too. It was left open-ended for the story to continue, and I'm looking forward to reading more.
2977634887	I love a good book with mind games, and this one definitely fit the bill! Great concept, great execution!
2784461774	I have been in a bit of a book slump and this is just what I needed! Killing November was such a fun read! The MC has no idea wth is going on when she’s placed into a boarding school full of future assassins and spies. This school is brutal but so awesome to read about! Knife throwing , poisons , climbing and accent impersonating are just some of the classes.I enjoyed piecing all the clues together along with November and trying to figure out who was trustworthy and who wasn’t and learning more about her history and where she came from.I’m ready for book 2!!!!!
3935169156	I’m going to be honest. YA mystery books have ALWAYS let me down. They’re just too predictable and I LOATHE the bland characters who have like zero brain cells. I was expecting Killing November to be some average mystery book where I would zone out for most of the book and still be able to guess the murderer. And I was right...in a sense. I did guess the murderer and I’m sure many others could too but I did not zone out of this book even for a second! This book was FUN! The sad part is that it was doing so well but then the book went and blew it all in the end 😑 The ending is very predictable and disappointing but I promise, the rest of the book makes up for it. The side plot where November adjusts to this assassins school keeps the book interesting at all times! If you’re a fan of fantasy and mystery this is THE book for you because it has cool assassin stuff (yes, “assassin stuff”. Very specific of me I know 😌 )Read the full review on my book blog: https://bookconfessionssecrets.weebly... What I likedThe setting and premise: FOR ONCE this YA mystery novel was not set in the same old small town setting where a mysterious teen death occurred at school and the main character happens to be some mastermind detective who easily is able to get down to the bottom of things when no one else can (I’m looking at you Karen McNamus). This story gives a different take to YA Mystery involving a school to train spies and assassins, which was WAYYY more interesting than whatever story Karen McNamus comes up with at some small town school. (Sorry I need to get over the grudge I have with this author, but everytime I try I get reminded of the monstrosity of “One of Us is Lying” and "Two Can Keep a Secret" and my grudge starts all over again. *Shudders*) Plot: The main reason this book is getting such a high rating from me is because it was SO FUN. Like seriously, after you get to page 50 it’s really hard to put this one down. As the plot progresses, the secrets about the school are slowly revealed bit by bit and you’re left wanting to know more.Fast Paced: There were no parts where the book got unbearably slow. Which is actually surprising because most books I have read in the past few months have had some really slowwwwwww middle parts. Then I end up taking a “small break” (more like a week-long break) where I avoid reading the book because I was bored. Huh, maybe that's why I have the reading speed of a snail. Anyways the pacing of this book is very well done and there are no slow parts here 😌 What I didn’t like:It was so predictable??? You know how mystery books usually choose a character to display as the obvious culprit but it never turns out to be them in the end? Yah well the author of this book never got the memo to make the murderer the least obvious choice. The really obvious choice ends up being the real culprit. It’s a huge letdown and I remember thinking “Ok at any moment now there will be a twist and the real murderer will be revealed”. I basically sat there through the last 50 pages waiting for a twist to happen and when it didn’t, I was beyond disappointed because THE MURDERER’S IDENTITY WAS LITERALLY SO PREDICTABLE.
