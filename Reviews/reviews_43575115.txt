2588322804	Someone PLEASE procure me a striking, modern, big-city apartment with lots of windows, where I can hold a glass of expensive wine and gaze unseeing over the skyline at night, because apparently I’m going to feel melancholy for the rest of my life over never again being able to read this for the first time and if I’m going to do so I at least want to be glamorous about it.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Or, at the very least, I need to locate the sort of old-fashioned library described in 1920s mystery novels with a bar cart stocked with aged scotch and shelves filled with leather-bound tomes, except their antique spines will be a façade for the kinds of things I actually enjoy reading, rather than being 800 different copies of the Bible or whatever, and I will never drink the scotch because everything about the process of drinking scotch is like the scotch is asking you not to drink it. (Scotch is the poison-dart frog of beverages.)Basically what I’m saying here is - Ever since I read the last page of this book three months ago, I have felt a small, unrelenting sadness, which I believe will only be solved by one of the following methods:a) I dedicate my life to tracking down a door to the Starless Sea, and either I find one or it turns out the real reward was the friends I made along the way;b) I experience repeated memory loss, allowing myself to read this book over and over again for the first time, re-beginning every time I finish it;or c) I live the rest of my days in homage to this story.All options will require funds that I will never have (I’m an English major, after all), so please kindly Venmo me at your convenience. Thanks.This is the most gorgeous ode to stories and literature. It’s a thank-you gift to anyone who has ever been a Reader, with a capital R - not just someone who reads but someone WHO READS, as an identity, as a life-force, as a passion, as the meaning of life. I dare any true bookworm to read this book with an open heart and a ready mind and not feel grateful that their life overlapped with its publication date.Erin Morgenstern’s ability to create divine settings you can see and smell and lust after and yearn to experience is unparalleled. My favorite book ever is, as anyone who has so much as made the online equivalent of eye contact me knows, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. I love it with enough passion that everything about it is my favorite of that thing: my favorite characters, my favorite prose, and, naturally, my favorite setting.Before I read this book, my unrivaled first runner-up was the setting of the Night Circus. Now, I think both Wonderland and the circus may have been bumped down a slot. Never has a setting known me, seen my soul, like that of the magical underground great world of stories in these pages.Plus, I didn’t have to slog through a Night Circus-level instalove romance to get there.This was a perfect book. Mysterious, confusing, strange, magical. Beautifully written and populated with characters you love hard and immediately. I read this so slowly because I SAVORED it. I, a compulsive speed-reader whose simultaneous highest compliment and M.O. is reading a book in a day or so, knew that my finishing this book would be a small heartbreak, and so I tried to postpone it as long as I could.So instead, I’ll pay the highest compliment to this that any reader can pay to any story - Bottom line: It was hard to pick up another book after reading this one.-------------rereading updatesTHIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!all month long, i'll be rereading this fav as part of my book club with my lovely elle! follow on instagram here or join the discussion here.-------------Yes, I teared up upon finishing my reread of this book like a starlet in an old movie.

2781789986	I waited the book for months and months, also named myself as Vladimir who is waiting for Godot forever! Of course my request stays at the NetGalley limbo space with other thousands of my requests doing boogie dance together. (I don’t want to visualize them dusted, positioned at the bookshelves kind of purgatory!) So as a patient reading, high five-d myself for releasing day (actually I slapped my nose, I couldn’t do a proper high five for years and always missing the other person’s hand or always find them on my face!!!!) Reading this book is seeing a dream into dream into dream. I felt like jumped into full throttle triple time intensive Inception universe. (So I visualized most of the book’s characters as Leo and Tom which made my day and give me an amazing selfie smile all day long!) So you’re reading amazing story about intertwined magical stories. It’s a mind-bending brain storming process because narrator jumps between stories and your grey cells get used to run marathons to catch where the main story goes and gather the crumbles left for you like Hansel and Gretel. But I have to admit at the final you find better place than a house made of sweets (Yes, I actually found my fountain of Chardonnay when I caught the simple rhythm of the stories. Let’ drink to that!) But I still feel the smoke coming out of my ears because this kind of brain gymnastic has side effect like over exhaustion and dismantle the rest of remaining brain cells. Luckily I know the feeling because I read too many Blake Crouch books that make me prepare this kind of mind-blowing experience. I like challenges! Bring it on!I also have to admit Morgenstern is a magician. She can bend words, add different meanings, put a lyrical touch to enchant you. Just like Night Circus, the same thing happened to me. I hear a wonderful symphony in my head and waltz in my room, remembering those intriguing, magical stories you want to keep reading. Even the book is too long, you don’t want to stop flipping pages and get lost in those creatively depicted universes and of course you never get bored and enjoy each second of your experience.Did I like it? NOOOOOO!!! I LOVEEEEDDDD IT SOOOO MUCCCHHH( I’m screaming right now but thankfully you can only sense my excitement from the big caps and wrong grammar usage :) )And don’t forget to enjoy every words about heartwarming, tempting love tale of Zachary and Dorian. It’s not about modern love it is about to find the person reminds you a place you could lose yourself in and never wish to be found. DEEP SIGH. Yes. I truly love it. Period!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter
2589781803	This is a review I did not want to write because this is a book I so desperately wanted to love. The Starless Sea is a book written for true readers. I’m talking about the kind of person who spent their childhood in and out of libraries and bookshops; the kind of person who sits and imagines adventure and an escape from the mundaneness of every single endless day without magic: the kind of person who lives for books and reading. As such it is totally enchanting to begin with it. It hooks you in and will promise you storytelling delights, but these promises are false and lead to absolutely nothing but disappointment because the story will lose itself and collapse inward: it will fail in a spectacularly miserable fashion. And it is tragic because this book has been an exceptionally long time in the making. It needed a better editor to polish this lump of rock into the diamond it ought to have been. So, do I think The Starless Sea could have been a good book? Absolutely. What it needed was time, refinement, and a great deal of editing. The prose is written superbly; however, the structure of the book is a complete narrative mess that goes nowhere and becomes terribly confusing as it collapses on itself and forgets the very purpose of storytelling: to tell a story, not simply beguile with pretty words and cool fantasy elements. There needs to be a purpose. I make no reservation in claiming that this book could have been as effective as Gaiman’s masterpiece The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It seriously had that much potential, but it was wasted. And I'm angry, bitter and frustrated because I do not want to write these words. I want to celebrate what this book could have been, not lament what it was not.I suppose two stars will have to do for this brilliantly enchanting book that wasted everything it had and failed to deliver what it promised. _________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________
2993675564	HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY TO THIS LITTLE COCKTAIL OF MAGIC AND WONDER!i know for a fact that this book wont be everyones cup of tea (morgensterns writing style is an acquired taste), but it sure is mine. this quenches my thirst for a story that was meant to be told, a love letter to the art of storytelling, as well as the stories we find ourselves in. it is an ode to those who write their own paths in life. and there is an aromatic intimacy to this that can only be created when such words are so tenderly placed on a page. with delicious notes of myth and legend, imagination and wonder, this supplies the perfect blend of magic, bravery, adventure, wisdom, and love. it is a full-bodied flavour that impacts the palate, leaving it satiated, yet somehow desiring more. this is a story to be savoured from one page to the next, entincing the reader to acknowledge all the smooth layers and undertones, because each word has such a meaningful presence, it would be a shame to miss something. and as i drink up every last letter, i become so delightfully intoxicated on the notion that we are all made of stories and stardust. its a buzzed feeling that reminds me exactly why i fell in love with reading in the first place and how we all become a part of the stories we love. 🐝 🗝 🗡 ↠ every star to return to the starless sea

3022799284	I did not enjoy this at all. Pretentious, confusing and jumping through time to make no sense whatsoever..I feel like I wasted a reading week. All my anticipated releases have been flops this year.Now what is this book about? Honestly your guess is as good as mine. There was a hint of some love stories but they were so muddled into everything else that was pointless and made no sense so who knows. The plot got lost, the writing style was so saturated in metaphors and description I got bored and there was a million tangents that didn’t add anything to the story except make you forget the story. Our main characters had potential but that soon faded with the character arcs they were given. There are lgbt characters but even that can’t convince me to like this book.And that ending? That is some open ended bullshit for a pointless sequel if this one sells well and you cannot convince me otherwise, so unnecessary.Arc received in exchange for review.
2846332460	After trying to describe my issues with this book, I have found the best comparison. There's a video of a raccoon putting cotton candy in water and staring at it as it dissolves... yup, that exactly how I felt. The writing is beautiful but I'm left empty handed and dissatisfied. I'm left wondering if I read the same book as everyone else and, quite frankly, feeling like I'm dumb because I don't get it.The premise sounded interesting but I was quickly lost and bored. By the end, I was so ready for it to be over.Not for me.Reading Vlog: https://youtu.be/lleS-mFDLgg
2588000253	This book is a love letter to stories and storytelling, myths and fables, symbols and imagination. This was haunting and magical, foreboding and whimsical in a way only Erin Morgenstern can achieve. This is a story in which something new can be discovered every time you read it. Breathtaking.

3587064693	Read this as part of my "Giving authors a second/last chance" challenge and...This is a tough one for me. I can acknowledge that Morgenstern’s writing is whimsical but after two books by her leaving me confused and unsatisfied, I have to admit her books are simply not for me.The worlds she creates are fascinating but I don't find myself caring enough about the story in them nor the characters. Frankly, I felt bored.If you've enjoyed The Night Circus, you'll most likely enjoy this one too. If you didn't, I would skip it!

2678034392	This is a masterpiece. This is flawless. This is the kind of book that comes along once in a decade. This cracks the foundations. Imagery: ★★★★★ Concepts: ★★★★★ Writing: ★★★★★ Pacing: ★★★★Erin Morgenstern is not for everyone. Her writing is for those who love the story for the sake of the story. The lyrical, meandering, and existential prose is not the standard format, and it takes no prisoners. If it's not for you, it's not for you. Normally, I try to make some sort of sense in my review. Talk about the characters, the plot, the atmosphere. The Starless Sea is too close to my heart to describe accurately. (What more can I say about it than what it says about itself?)It's about a subterranean library living labyrinthine space where the stories are often books, but not always.Time and Fate are characters with an eternal love affair, but Fate was cursed to unravel over and over. Sometimes, Fate can put itself back together again. Time is always waiting. Zachary Ezra Rawlins is the son of a fortune teller, and he discovers that his story has been fated since the moment he saw his door to the Starless Sea years ago. He didn't open the door then, but your story has a way of finding you even when you're not aware of its presence. The Starless Sea is about metaphorical pirates, the Moon and her lover, Fate and Time, the power of the story, the cycle of beginnings and endings, owls, and bees. It has stories within stories, and perspectives that shift within the construct of time. I loved it. I can't wait to read it again. As Morgenstern said in an interview, if The Night Circus embodied the concept of fall, The Starless Sea embodies the concept of winter. She says she's going to conceptualize spring for her next one...and I'm dying to read it. Morgenstern, tell me a tale.Blog | Instagram
4087512991	why can't I just like things.
3033506005	DNFed @ 56%THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR!The writing is so abstract that I couldn't take it anymore! And the problem is I expected that, I wanted that, but it was just SO MUCH!I'm so sad right now, I really wanted to love this 😭I feel this was a cheap copy of The Shadow of the Wind, even The Ten Thousand Doors of January to me was similar and better than this.I'm gonna crawl into a hole and cry myself to sleep now!
2588622023	Am I confused as heck? Yes. But was this book the most incredibly magical, moving, imaginative and absolutely immersive gem I’ve read in a long time? Also yes. I enjoyed this so much more than The Night Circus! "We are all stardust and stories." Ok, where do I begin? I can honestly say I've never read anything like this book before. Zachary Ezra Rawlings finds a book in the library that isn't catalogued and becomes curious. Once he begins reading 'Sweet Sorrows' he discovers a world beyond his wildest dreams - and the weirdest part? One of the chapters in the book is a part of Zachary's childhood - he is reading about himself. "Do not be afraid; our fate cannot be taken from us; it is a gift." Pretty soon Zachary becomes obsessed with this book and will do anything to discover more about how it was written, and what it means that he is in the story. I won't say too much because I think it's best to go in blind and be swept away with the magic of this book. "Because I haven't figured out the puzzle yet even though I don't know what the puzzle is. Because I feel more alive down here than I ever did up there." The world of the Starless Sea is filled with wonder and imagination, don't expect to understand everything because honestly some of it just went straight over my head. But what really tipped this for me was the wonderful short stories between each chapter. Stories about fate and time, the moon and the sun, the Owl King and Princesses, swordsmiths and pirates. Erin Morgenstern's imagination is unparalleled, I just can't give it 5 stars because I didn't fully understand some parts of the world. "If all endings are beginnings, are all beginnings also endings?" ******************Just picked up this beauty from the library. I didn’t love The Night Circus - too romancy for me, but I could appreciate its beautiful and imaginative elements. I’m looking forward to this one 😊
3143489598	I’m so sad to have not liked this book. I’ve read so many amazing reviews of it and had such high hopes. But alas, this was not my cup of tea. Swords. Bees. Books. Keys. Painted doors. Sea of honey. Owl king. Fate. The moon. Fortune Tellers. Cats. Is it an alternate reality? Is it the inside of a book? Is it the inside of a crazed mind? Is it magic? Is it aliens? I. Don’t. Know. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I held out hope all the way through that something would finally click for me... that I’d have a mind blown moment of ‘ahhh-haaaaa!!’ I get it and it’s fantastic! Unfortunately that just didn’t happen for me. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I honestly couldn’t wait for it to be over. It’s not the worst thing I’ve read. It has some spots but of intrigue. Overall I guess I lack the imagination to appreciate the sporadic whimsy this book offers.
4888133347	A mandatory Warning- If you are a “The Starless Sea” enthusiast, immediately exit the review, as I can’t help but rant, to realign back my braincells:-/Beleaguered and with insuperable reluctance, I take total responsibility of all the ranting, raving and griping below (while citing examples from the text!).Erin Morgenstern, is a craftswoman of enamouring captivating words! But just catapulting a mountain of lurid words, with no solid rhyme-or-reason, is definitely not sufficient to redeem a book! Pet-Peeves: - This book is a quintessential of “Pettifogging". I had to extricate all the convoluted knots in my head, post the read!☹It was the most tedious task, to be subjected to the trial and tribulations of finishing a bulky plot-less book!! No disrespect/hate for this work, as I am not the most read/ knowledgeable person, so I might have missed out on few points! This review, is just to vent out the angst and frustration I was subjected to, so pardon me if I go overboard, I am disgruntled!! It was the most inopportune moment when I was indentured to this book! I wish I could have pre-empted, the decision.I hope if at that most unfortunate, plaintive moment, I could have buried the book somewhere, just never to be found again! ☹It is a LGBT YA fantasy, with a guy named Zachary, stumbling upon a book “Sweet Sorrows” in a library. He discovers the third part of the book, citing his own story and is finally intrigued and sets onto a whimsical journey (just to torment me ludicrously)! I admire the LGBT part(I admire Zachary falling in love with Dorian!)Upto 5 percent of the book, I was all fascinated, captivated, enticed, with the library, books, looking forward to the euphoria and alchemy, but post that, my brain was battered, abused and maltreated at regular intervals. I kept questioning myself, why am I still reading it? Is it because of the striking cover, or because of the prolific reviews on GRs, or because I wanted to pick it up prior to Night Circus? I wonder, if I will ever be able to muster the courage, to pick up Night Circus, post this tedium! ☹By the time I finished 25 percent, there was no story, and it stayed the same till the end! But because of the time and efforts already invested, I continued, which was my biggest mistake! I confess!With no character development, it is the vaguest of the vague!EM definitely, has read exuberantly, and the atmospheric setting is brilliant, but it keeps swaying sporadically from one prose to another, and I simply couldn’t register anything. Just like the sporadic short stories kept swaying without any implication! Fantasy and whimsy, isn’t meant to leave one in angst, frustration or annoyance, but this left me utterly disappointed, disgruntled and fuming! Finally numb. I could have read 2 other novels, instead of this persecution!As a child, I would gather cut-outs of newspapers, magazines, to make a collage, and with a gleam in my eyes, admire at my creation!I think, Erin Morgenstern, has had been collecting all her favourite quotes/prose on atmospheric settings, throughout, dumped all into one book, “The Starless Sea”, with overflowing nonsensical stories! If she would have worked on the storyline, then it would have been a sheer masterpiece!I wouldn’t recite the storyline, as I don’t want to be inflicted with the pain of writing the convoluted, contrived, stories, without being able to connect them, as I couldn’t find any connection! ☹Sheer Cerebral Attack, with random short stories, suspended in thin air, enough to make anyone lunatic, disgruntled, rant and rave, just like I am ranting!Moreover, reading the 2nd half of the book was the most tormenting affair for me. With every chapter ending, I was made to realise that it was a contrived whimsy, and I was hallucinating all the while! Seriously?? Sheer, time-wastage!!!I was frazzled out with this frizzled out plot! Plot, sorry, there was no plot!Every metaphor is a metaphor for everything else! It is a labyrinthine of words!############################## Sharing a few- “Poetry,” Mirabel repeats. “The weather. It’s like a poem. Where each word is more than one thing at once and everything’s a metaphor. The meaning condensed into rhythm and sound and the spaces between sentences. It’s all intense and sharp, like the cold and the wind.”“She sat next to me and told me that we were the people that the narrative would have followed out from the party if we were in a movie or a novel or something. We were where the story was, the story you could follow like a string, not all the overlapping party stories in the house, tangled up with too many dramas soaked in cheap alcohol and stuffed into not enough rooms.”“A book is an interpretation,” she says. “You want a place to be like it was in the book but it’s not a place in a book it’s just words. The place in your imagination is where you want to go and that place is imaginary.”“Can't make an egg without breaking a few metaphors.”########################I couldn’t understand the idea/purpose/moral of the book! Period.I tried to derive; what Erin Morgenstern would have tried to convey, from the below two citations-In one of the conversations between Mirabel and Zachary: -“He tells her about moving from place to place to place and never feeling like he ever belonged in any of them, how wherever he was he would almost always rather be someplace else, preferably somewhere fictional. He tells her how he worries that none of it means anything. That none of it is important. That who he is, or who he thinks he is, is just a collection of references to other people’s art and he is so focused on story and meaning and structure that he wants his world to have all of it neatly laid out and it never, ever does and he fears it never will”Is it about finding own standing in the universe? I applaud the fact of Zachary finding a mate/boyfriend for himself? But is EM, trying to emphasize that one needs to find a human, to find own standing in the world? That’s ludicrous.Next, towards the end of the novel, sharing an excerpt from Kat’s secret diary: -“I remember wondering if this story was an analogy about people who stay in places or relationships or whatever situations longer than they should because they’re afraid of letting go or moving on or the unknown, or how people hold on to things because they miss what the thing was even if that isn’t what that same thing is now.”EM had to explain the purpose of the book using Kat’s secret diary, instead of working on the actual storyline.What did Zachary let go or release? I couldn’t find anything he released or executed on his own throughout the book!Without any further belabouring-With a jaded spirit, I give 1.5 stars, for the underground library establishment with books. Books, which made me euphoric initially! And yes, the atmospheric-building is laden with prose (but it is just too much, profuse and lurid!)I totally get when EM, mentions about the readers interpreting each book, her/his own way! But there got to be a dialogue established between the author and the reader. There got to be some storyline or moral, worth to be deciphered. It is highly unfair, just to write a detached jargon of lurid words, and leave it to the readers to interpret their own way, and call it a book/story! ☹I am jaded and faded! Totally wearied out, forlorn!I am listening to “Faded” by Alan Walker! ☹So, lost!!
3209579728	No nie, nie…. Co to było
3694828209	I had no idea what was happening for 90% of this book, but guess what? I did not give a fuck. I knew something was going to lead to something else, and I knew the story would have gorgeous lyrical writing, and I knew there would be a gay romance. That’s enough for me. Honestly, I really considered putting this book off for a while because I had made no progress whatsoever. It took me about three weeks to read this book and it put me in a reading slump - hence the reason I took off one star, because I would have enjoyed everything else if I’d been able to genuinely read. But I still loved it, and I loved the experience.“Strange, isn’t it? To love a book. When the words on the pages become so precious that they feel like part of your own history because they are.”The writing of this book was so metaphorical, trippy and lyrical, and I fell in love. It was a little bit weird to get used to at first, because there were a lot of run-on sentences and different expressions, but once I did I could understand why it was written like that.It was kind of weird to read descriptions that came across so strangely, but I honestly loved it. I thought the writing was beautiful and unique without sounding too contrived. It was almost poetic, without all the extra enter spaces.“I’m agnostopagan.”The Keeper cocks his head questioningly.“Spiritual but not religious,” Zachary clarifies. He doesn’t say what he is thinking, which is that his church is held-breath story listening and late-night-concert ear-ringing rapture and perfect-boss fight-button pressing. That his religion is buried in the silence of freshly fallen snow, in a carefully crafted cocktail, in between the pages of a book somewhere after the beginning but before the ending.”I feel like the way the writing fit so well with the story and the character’s thoughts was so perfect. If you’ve ever read The Night Circus, it’s a bit like that? But it’s less descriptive and more metaphorical, and it goes by its own standards. The Night Circus feels like it fits more traditionally compared to the writing of this book.I did find it a little bit annoying at first. I loved it, don’t get me wrong, but it kind of grated on me to read commas where I anticipated periods, or a sentence that didn’t really follow the structure that I’m used to.“Everything whispers the story here, the sea and the bees whisper and I listen and I try to find the shape of it all. Where it has been and where it is going. New stories wrap themselves around the old ones. The ancient stories that flames whisper to moths.”I think that style was very fitting for the book, though.There were a lot of parentheses and strange comparisons that make sense in a way that pretty much no one has thought of before, and I think that’s one of the reasons that everything in this book felt so connected. There were so many stories and connections and tie-overs that I just felt so disoriented, and everything seemed so disjointed, but you could tell that it was leading to what would really tie it all together. If I were to say it in a Starless Sea-esque way, it’s like this book showed me all the strings individually before being led to the knot that wove them together.“He has brown eyes but his hair is blond, she has read so many books where blond hair goes with blue eyes that she finds it incongruous. His face is so much more than hair and eye color, she wonders why books do not describe the curves of noses or the length of eyelashes. She studies the shape of his lips. Perhaps a face is too complicated to capture in words.”The storyline threw me off a little bit, since I wasn’t sure what was happening. I could tell it was leading up to something, since there were so many bits interspersed in, but I wasn’t entirely sure what the book was about.This book begins with our main character, Zachary Ezra Rawlins, finding a strange unmarked book in the library. As he reads, he finds a story in it that he knows - because it’s a scene from his childhood. This takes him on a long journey, uncovers a few secrets that probably shouldn’t have existed in the first place, and brings him to meet a few people.“Is this all in my head?” Zachary asks as they twirl amongst the golden crowd. “Am I making all of this up?”“If you were, whatever answer I gave you would also be made up, wouldn’t it?” Mirabel answers.”The plot blends from Zachary’s perspective through the stories of Sweet Sorrows, the book he found. The fables and stories being interwoven with the basic storyline gradually became more complex as other stories came up and characters were brought in.I have to be honest, the plot was pretty slow. It took me a lot of time to get through forty percent of the book, and when I got there I needed to go through all the rave reviews of this book to motivate myself further. I know I’ve advocated for The Night Circus to a lot of people, but now I see their side of it. It’s a lot less enjoyable.“It shouldn’t be too long to walk,” Mirabel says. “Sorry it’s so poetry today.”“So what?” Zachary asks, not certain he heard her correctly.“Poetry,” Mirabel repeats. “The weather. It’s like a poem. Where each word is more than one thing at once and everything’s a metaphor. The meaning condensed into rhythm and sound and the spaces between sentences. It’s all intense and sharp, like the cold and the wind.”“You could just say it’s cold out.”“I could.”The characters were all so unique. They were just completely their own creation. Or Erin Morgenstern’s creations.Zachary Ezra Rawlins is always introduced by his full name whenever his perspective starts. He’s a college student in Vermont who likes RPGs and books, and his mother is a fortune-teller. He’s our main character. Zachary is very relatable in his awkwardness, and his perspective was so much fun to read. I loved that he was, in book terms, a dreamer.His development was subtle and wasn’t really a change of character more than a slow nuance of who he was in the story. It was intriguing to be in his head and to find so much of a story in one character.“He opens the door and steps through it. And so the son of the fortune-teller finds his way to the Starless Sea.”Mirabel was a fun character. I liked how very casual and do-it-my-own way she was. She seemed like she literally did not give a fuck for half the book, which made her secrets very interesting. Also, I loved her pink hair.“She sat next to me and told me that we were the people that the narrative would have followed out from the party if we were in a movie or a novel or something. We were where the story was, the story you could follow like a string, not all the overlapping party stories in the house, tangled up with too many dramas soaked in cheap alcohol and stuffed into not enough rooms.”Dorian was beautiful. He was such a rich character and I loved his storytelling abilities. He drew me in and made me really want to know his secrets, because he was one of those very naturally mysterious people.“This is where the moon goes when she cannot be seen in the sky,” Dorian slowly breathes each word against Zachary’s lips.”Kat was a very interesting character who I expected would be minor and thrown in at the beginning, but then she came back into the narrative. I’m not complaining. She was fun and quirky (but not in a bad way, I mean she just legitimately had a fun personality) and she was willing to knit Hogwarts scarfs. I’m sold.“Not all stories speak to all listeners, but all listeners can find a story that does, somewhere, sometime. In one form or another.”The emotional depth to literally everything in this book, from the writing to the metaphors to the characters, was shocking. I never thought honey or fireplaces or a dollhouse would move me, especially not fictional honey/fireplaces/dollhouses, but somehow they did.I was shook at how Erin Morgenstern made metaphors out of things that I didn’t even know worked as book objects, and then made me feel something for them. I love my library, but I didn’t ever think reading about a library would make me feel emotional.“The bulb breaks with a soft cracking noise and takes the light with it, leaving Zachary alone in the dark with the charred remains of a miniature universe.”This book is about stories. It’s really not about Zachary, or his life, or the underground realm he finds. It’s not about his love of video games and Dorian. It’s about storytelling. It’s about how characters and their choices can change the path of a story, how narratives can be altered by one moment, and how entire universes can exist in our minds just because of the words on the page.“You knew that would happen,” he says. “You made all of this happen.”“I did not. I gave you doors. You chose whether or not you opened them. I don’t write the story, I only nudge it in different directions.”The fables blew me away. I thought writing a book was hard enough, but somehow Erin Morgenstern created a collection of fairy tales and added them into this book as part of another book? The Owl King, the three swords, and the innkeeper felt like they were real tales, not just invented for this book.“I have never met a girl who wears trousers before,” he says, hoping she does not take offense.“I can’t climb things in a dress,” Eleanor explains, as though stating a simple fact.“Climbing is not for girls.”“Anything is for girls.”Sweet Sorrow, Fortunes and Fables, The Ballad of Simon and Eleanor, and The Owl King were all books within this book, and they blew me away. This was literally five books in one.He wonders if he has stumbled upon a place where girls do not play games, where there are not unspoken rules to follow. No expectations. No chaperones. He wonders if his mother was like that. Wonders what makes a woman a witch.”The romance was perfectly gay (that’s a good thing). It progressed very slowly and subtly, but enough that you could tell something was happening. There was also no love triangle (YES).“It is easier to be in love in a room with closed doors. To have the whole world in one room. One person. The universe condensed and intensified and burning, bright and alive and electric.”The one complaint that I had was that it went very slowly. It was nice that the romance wasn’t the center of the book and that everything was plot-focused, but it felt like there was a lot of time between each romantic moment. That made it a lot easier to forget about and kind of took away from the process of really shipping those two.“Something changes in the laughter, something is lost and something else is found and though Zachary does not have words for what has happened, there is an ease between them that wasn’t there before.”That being said, the romance was very sweet, even though I feel like it didn’t get enough of a chance to develop properly. The chemistry, although it took a while to get there, was done really well and I couldn’t help loving the dynamic between these two.“I need you to know that what I feel for you is real. Because I think you feel the same. I have lost a lot of things and I don’t want to lose this, too.”I think the worst part about the romance (although like I said, it was executed pretty well) was that these two didn’t know each other very well. They met, then got separated, then didn’t really spend a lot of time together before love started up. I feel like they didn’t get to understand each other (aside from their nearly-automatic connection that kind of bothered me but was also pretty nice).“There is a warmness to the brown of Dorian’s eyes that he had not been able to see before. There is a scar above his left eyebrow. There are so many pieces to a person. So many small stories and so few opportunities to read them. I would like to look at you seems like such an awkward request.”Other than that, the romance was beautiful and I loved the dynamic that developed between Zachary and Dorian. Their relationship at the end was just...so worth it.“If…if anything happens—”“Don’t you dare,” Dorian interrupts him. “Don’t you dare make this goodbye. I am going to find you. We are going to find each other and we are going to figure this out together. You may be by yourself but you are not alone.”“It’s dangerous to go alone,” Zachary says, almost automatically.”I loved how this book addressed escapism. It validates everyone who prefers books or games or movies to the real world, and gives you a portal to a realm where that’s normal and appreciated. It validates feeling like you belong to a fictional world instead of the real one.“These doors will sing. Silent siren songs for those who seek what lies behind them.For those who feel homesick for a place they’ve never been to.Those who seek even if they do not know what (or where) it is that they are seeking.Those who seek will find.Their doors have been waiting for them.”The Starless Sea is a whole realm of stories. This book is a whole world made just for all of us readers and nerds. I love it. I love how it combined an entire journey of self-discovery with a library and fairy tales and a few strange metaphors, and it was gorgeous.“For a while I was looking for a person but I didn't find them and after that I was looking for myself. Now that I've found me I'm back to exploring, which is what I was doing in the first place before I was doing anything else and I think I was supposed to be exploring all along.”“How are you feeling? Zachary asks.“Like I’m losing my mind but in a slow, achingly beautiful sort of way.”That’s the experience I had while reading this book. Everything was assembled so painstakingly and yet beautifully, and I couldn’t wrap my head around it for 90% of the time.“Be brave,” she says. “Be bold. Be loud. Never change for anyone but yourself. Any soul worth their star-stuff will take the whole package as is and however it grows. Don’t waste your time on anyone who doesn’t believe you when you tell them how you feel.”Overall, this read was worth the long experience and consequent reading slump. It’s not really for everyone, because of its unique style, but I think it’s better-received than The Night Circus. Still, I really liked it and would have rated it five stars if it hadn’t been as slow. That was part of the journey, though - the long, controlled build of the story. It’s drawn out, but exciting.“But the world is strange and endings are not truly endings no matter how the stars might wish it so.”
3625356813	”Far beneath the surface of the earth, hidden from the sun and the moon, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories.”There are stories that leave you with thousands of questions, that cause you to topple under the sheer weight of their words.And then there are stories that leave you with a million questions more,but each and every single one of them feels like a soft caress.Like a tender kiss on your longing skin. Like a shiver running through your craving mind.You don’t want answers to those questions. You just want to experience what they will do to you.Which kind of emotions they will evoke, which sort of feelings they’ll drag to the surface. You want to lose yourself in the story, dive deeper, be a part of it, touch it with your own fingertips...Never let it go. “The Starless Sea” is exactly this kind of story and it was an extraordinary pleasure to read it! ”A boy at the beginning of a story has no way of knowing that the story has begun.”The boy at the beginning of this particular story is Zachary Ezra Rawlins and he’s as relatable as a reader can be. He’s a student, has a TBR he’s trying to reduce, is more comfortable reading a book than being out with his friends and was sorted into Ravenclaw. And one day he meets a mysterious storyteller who draws him into a world of wonder and mystery. Into the world of the Starless Sea.”You are here because you wish to sail the Starless Sea and breathe the haunted air.”The mere idea of the Starless Sea was already so intriguing and I loved to explore the Harbour. I mean some sort of labyrinthine underground library that looks like an art museum and seems to go on forever? Show me only one bookworm that wouldn’t enjoy a place like that! Also there were cats everywhere which was such a nice touch because I love all sorts of cats. Moreover there even were mysterious locked rooms and I’m such a sucker for them. I always want to know what’s behind those locked doors and my curiosity knows no boundaries. *lol* In short: I lived and breathed this story! ”You had superior meet-cutes with the others, no wonder you like them both better. You’ve cast me as a villain.”And of course, like every story, “The Starless Sea” had a villain as well. Allegra was pretty intriguing and I think she was one of those antagonists that fascinate you. She has her principles and methods (for instance “late-night intimidation tea” – I love that term btw ;-P) and she’s convinced that her way is the only right one. It’s hard to dislike a villain like that and I found myself more and more captivated by her character and presence. Speaking of which: Dorian was such a wonderful and complex character as well. ”You’re not wearing shoes.”“I hate shoes.”“Hate is a strong emotion for footwear,” Zachary observes.“Most of my emotions are strong,” Dorian responds and again Zachary doesn’t know how to reply and Dorian saves him from having to.I just loved that boy! And the moment he got introduced into the story is definitely among my favourite bookish moments ever! It was mysterious, amazing, intriguing and shiver-inducing. Gosh how I wish I could have heard that story right from Dorian’s lips. I probably would have died. XD He sounds like a man I could easily fall for and he was described so vividly that I could imagine myself listening to his stories while taking in his appearance and gestures. He’s a character that seduces with his voice and words and up until now I didn’t even know that I’ve a weakness for men like that but apparently I do. As does Zachary. *lol* But to everyone who thinks this is going to be a love story: Be warned! This is one hell of a slow-burn and a very unconventional one at that. ;-) Also it’s not the focus of the story. This tale is more intricate and multi-layered than you might expect.”It is there, still,” he says and pauses for so long that Zachary thinks perhaps the story has concluded but then he leans closer. “This is where the moon goes when she cannot be seen in the sky,” Dorian slowly breathes each word against Zachary’s lips.I think I don’t want to go into more detail because this is definitely a story you’ve to experience for yourself. Just like “The Night Circus” it’s a tale I can’t describe. You just have to read it, feel it, get immersed in it. All those stories within stories, mesmerizing dreams turning into grotesque nightmares, little pieces that merge into one story and questions that might not always be answered. Succumb to the temptation and allow the narrative to drown you in the depths of the Starless Sea. If you give yourself to the story, I can guarantee the story will give you something back. ;-)P.S: (view spoiler)[That gorgeous painting of Zachary and Dorian, though!!! I’d love to see it in real life! It sounded amazing and I found a fan art that managed to capture its essence. Still, in my imagination it’s way different and I wish I could draw it just to get it out of my head! (hide spoiler)]____________________________This book was so damn good! Like woah!! O_oI know this is a story that’s not for everyone and yes, Erin Morgenstern's books are some sort of an acquired taste but boy, do they work for me! <3 I’m so mind blown I feel like I felt after watching the ending of “Inception”. Full RTC once I figured out how to get all those feelings and thoughts into a single review. *lol*____________________________________It’s time to read another book of my Book List 2020! I wanted to read “The Starless Sea” for ages and the fact this is written by Erin Morgenstern only made me even more curious. I absolutely loved and adored “The Night Circus” and I can’t wait to get lost in her beautiful words again. Also if you know me, you know that I’m a sucker for masquerade parties, secret clubs and bookish labyrinths! I’m sure this can’t get any better than it already is and all I want to do is to dive into this world! <333
3123724343	3 starsTime for those who have read my reviews before to see a bit of deja vu. I have from time to time mentioned books that are artsy for the sake of moving along the story in a unique fashion and they are wonderful. But, on the other side, there are books that are artsy for the sake of being artsy. Books where the weird and fantastic plot points feel forced in order to make the book seem edgy and trendy. This is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, so you may not feel the same about this as I do from book to book. For me, The Starless Sea rode a fine line between the two the whole way.At first, I really got into the fantasy world of this book. It was doing a wonderful job of building a magical connection between the real world and a world from books. It reminded me a bit of The Shadow of the Wind. In fact, I am pretty sure they referenced that book early on. (I say pretty sure because I am reading multiple books, so it could have been in one of those!). I thought the writing style was wonderful and remained so throughout.However, as the story progressed, I started to lose the continuity of the storyline because it felt like it was trying to hard to be "fantastic". There were about 5 separate storylines that jumped around and the events in each just got stranger and stranger. Every so often there were a few moments that reoriented me to the actual progress, but the last half was mainly disorientation and some lack of interest. If it was not audio, I am not sure I would have finished.Some may love this book a great deal and enjoy getting lost in the artsy twists and turns of the multiple storylines. But, if you have ever agreed with me before on books being artsy for the sake of being artsy, you may have the same experience I did.
2587973984	I finished 'The Starless Sea' by Erin Morganstern. Ok, I skimmed the last 200 pages. Here is my review.Gather a library of your favorite books of literature about the joy of reading, about fantasy, with imaginative creativity, full of delightful imagery and three-dimensional symbolism, whether they are those novels from childhood or as an adult. Cut out the pages from all of them, then scatter the pages, throwing them into the air. Then at random, pick up a page and cut it into individual paragraphs. Cut out sentences that are gorgeous, or scissor out the descriptions which make your heart sing when you read them. Pick up a cut out scrap of a sentence or paragraph at random from the resulting pile of favorite fragments, then another. Figure out what order between the two scraps works best to make a kind of a progressive story being told. Paste each piece of a paragraph, sentence, description, chapter, which you pick up randomly out of the pile of cut-up pages into a successive order which seems to tell a story into a 600-page scrapbook. There! You have a handmade book of beautiful descriptions, sentences - each of them beloved by you, being parts of stories from your favorite books that are your favorites because of the beauty of the writing. Such lovely writing! It certainly must make another beautifully written book when fitted into another order! A reconstructed architecture of beautiful writing must be a beautiful five-star novel, whatever its architecture!But this scrapbook you just made - maybe you've made a new story out of wonderful writing, but suddenly you see while some pasted-in randomly chosen sentences and paragraphs seem to 'work' for awhile, the story got fragmented. The plot wanders; the characters do not follow through an action coherently because of the random paste-up way you selected sentences and paragraphs. In fact, the characters, all of whom you remembered you love when in context in your original beloved book, seem to have lost something of their charm in this more esoteric chaos you have pasted up. You have given them new names, but they are recognizable - from Alice in Wonderland, femme fatales and handsome heroes from action stories, nerdy duckling characters who really are swans, Harry Potter and his props, etc. - but now they are one-dimensional because of the scattered setting and new plot. Fragments.As the re-constituted version you just created moves forward - but is it moving forward? - you realize the reconstructed beloved or interesting characters you surreptitiously placed in this new story are not actualizing for you. The plot seems to turn plotless, too. The plot? A girl character is walking through a forest and falls through a door, then a pirate seduces a girl with stories, then a college student goes to a costume party after a mysterious invitation, then a completely different set of people are struggling for a book running through halls full of books. A heart lies inside a puzzle box lying on top of a book, and while the heart exists, stories will never die in the eyes of owls. A man enters an elevator with no buttons to indicate floors. Bees, swords and keys are burned into human chests by tongueless acolytes, while guardians wearing white fur coats chase a confused man stumbling in a dark street which turns into a leafy forest in summer, and then finds himself on a snowy slope with large-eyed owls. Cats, bored and yawning, are sitting in a nearby bookcase set in a rocky cliff wall, with an elaborately carved door in the middle shelf. Where is the painted doorknob? A cave becomes a museum with candles, kitchen and chandeliers. Then friends are together sailing a boat on a starless sea. They drink the honey the sea consists of. A college student dies, then he turns into a table while his friends drink tea and eat muffins on top of his body, wondering if there are doors beyond the sea or will the sea disappear? Looking about, they see cats and owls staring at them from rocky cliffs. Fate pulls itself together, while Time cries. The moon and sun are together conspiring against Fate - again...The end.

To those that recognize themselves in stories and to those that love to immerse themselves in stories. The blending of reality and fiction in this book was executed PERFECTLY, in my opinion.There were fairytales interwoven after the chapters about the present day, where Zachary Ezra Rawlins starts his journey when he stumbles across a beguiling book, one which in fact mirrors his own childhood! These fairytales just added so much intrigue and magic in equal measure to The Starless Sea, where stories are saved and cherished and shared, yet equally fractured at times, pages torn out and scattered, only to be forgotten.╰⪼ But is a story ever forgotten? Do we ever finish a story?The Starless Sea took me on a ride of a lifetime, no lie. This book is utterly spellbinding, there was no way that I could not be pulled into the depths of this story and every turn was an utter joy and more often than not, purely heart wrenching. I didn’t even try to guess what would come next, truthfully – it was just perfection going along with Zachary Ezra Rawlins as he tried to piece the stories together, literally. What were the hidden meanings of the three symbols that kept popping up, the bee, the key and the sword?Honestly, if I could go back and read The Starless Sea all over again for the first time, I utterly would.

3406103863	The absolute definition of a mood read. I first picked this one up when what I wanted was story, ideally a snappy one. This is not the book for that mood, and I put it aside. But I tried again when I was in a contemplative mood, the kind of mood when you're sipping a slightly honeyed cocktail and wishing it was healthy to smoke so the wisps from your cigarette would curl noirishly around your book as you read. This is the book for that mood, full of rich imagery and layered myths and oceans of symbols. The hero is passive and a bit maddening, and the plot doesn't tie up all its loose ends. But if you're in the mood for fragrant pipe smoke and honeyed cocktails, the kind of mood where you dreamily thumb through endless Instagram pictures of fantasy libraries (the kind where bookshelves meld effortlessly with forests or oceans or beehives) then this is a rich, enjoyable read. The plot doesn't really lead you anywhere so much as present you with overlapping patterns of plot that emerge slowly from the depths, as you see how various stories within stories connect with each other. I can't say everything about this book was entirely successful but I know it will stay with me a long time.
3678775376	A character driven book featuring magical realism. You wanna get your hot chocolate, grab a fluffy blanket and get in front of the fire (or under your duvet) when you read this. Slow paced, with the narrative taking a meandering path through the story.2 things I didn’t like;1. The time travel-y bits went over my head a little2. I didn’t love the characters but I didn’t hate them either - they were just ‘there’It’s one of those books that will split people so you have to experience it for yourself. You can’t just read it, you have to get lost in it and become immersed in the story. Fantastical and mesmerising, and I hope there’s a sequel..
2961188060	It’s difficult to sum up a novel that has made a home in your heart and mind and will reside there for a lifetime. I began The Starless Sea, thinking it would be another whimsical and atmospheric novel written by Erin Morgenstern but quickly fell head over heels for its likeness to The Shadow of the Wind, another favorite novel of mine. Both of these stories share a deep love for words and the stories created in our minds, and the love for books and how they can change us forever is at the forefront of each novel, but the Starless Sea stands on its own in terms of the uniqueness of it all. This story is a slow-moving tale that unfurls before your eyes in a way that you want to savor and take your time with. I let myself be whisked up by this book and really let every page and passage seep into me because I knew every moment was vital to the storyline, and I didn’t want to miss a word of Morgenstern’s atmospheric and vivid writing. While some may not be able to get into this story because it’s so slow-moving and packed with intricate fairytales and descriptions which took me a month to get through, I really enjoyed taking my time with this story and letting it move at its own relaxed pace because I knew this story would become a favorite of mine within the first 40 pages I read. One of my favorite details of this book is the amount of fairytale-like stories woven into the narrative. Morgenstern plays with the idea of what is reality and what isn’t, how video-games are structured compared to novels, and gives fantastical reasonings and happenings to further her story in a way that is utterly her own, and I am such a big fan of her use of symbolism with the feathers, hearts, bees, swords, etc. Those elements were intertwined into the story seamlessly and always held importance which I just appreciate a lot. What impressed me the most was the fact that I fell out of the story, at one point, and realized this was written in the 3rd person when I was about half way through the book. I usually have a very, very tough time reading and getting invested into a 3rd person narration because I feel so separated from the story and characters and I find it tedious to run along with, but starting and riding along with The Starless Sea was effortless. The writing is so easy to fall into, and I give Morgenstern kudos for managing to make me enjoy a 3rd person narrative which happens once in a blue moon. Another minor detail I really enjoyed was the amount of cats in this novel and how adorable they were. They felt like characters of their own, and just the quirkiness of this novel, the people in it, the world Morgenstern created, and the fairytales she spun together were something all of its own and left me in awe of someone’s ability to create vast worlds within the pages of a book. This is most definitely a favorite read of 2019 and of all time.
3063946797	This Review ✍️ Blog 📖 Twitter 🐦 Instagram 📷Actual rating: 4.25 stars “Not all stories speak to all listeners, but all listeners can find a story that does, somewhere, sometime. In one form or another.” ★ I picked up the above quote because it sums up my experience with this book! This book is definitely not for everyone. It was initially not even for me, I picked it up at a bad time and I was physically and mentally tired and just kept falling asleep. I was not a fan of The Night Circus and so decided that maybe Erin’s writing is just not for me. However, my friend said that this was the best book he has ever read and he kept talking about it every time we saw each other. I had to give it another fair chance. I went in with a different mindset and I enjoyed it much more the second time.★ The writing style uses many metaphors, similes, and analogies! Thus it required me to be in a certain mood for something as lyrical and it required much concentration from me. I noticed that at the times I read this after a long day and I was tired, I did not enjoy it as when I did with a clear mind. The book changed from an almost DNF to a book that I enjoyed. That’s why I can relate to both groups of people who were disappointed with this or those who said it is the best thing they ever read. “We are all stardust and stories.” ★ I don’t know what to say about the characters, I enjoyed reading about them and once again it is all related to the writing. Zachary was a good main character and there is gay romance in the book, it is very very slow and I do not think it was the main focus of the book.★ The book is also slow-paced and it may be confusing with the intertwining short stories and mythology and the main story taking place in the world. There are portals to other worlds (a theme that is becoming common in books now) and there are stories within stories (I have also not many read books of the book within book trope so it was cool). This all needs patience to be able to wait to get the rest of the stories and then more patience to see how it all falls in place and finally make sense and that’s why this needs a specific kind of mood and readers!★ I did not have a problem with that as I loved how well-edited this was! The timing of those stories and how each chapter started was something I just loved about the book! I am not giving it 5 because at a certain point it became a bit tiring for me and for a book so rich with metaphors one of the main metaphors was just far stretched for me. “How are you feeling? Zachary asks. “Like I’m losing my mind but in a slow, achingly beautiful sort of way.” ★ Summary: I really enjoyed this book the second time. It just needs a certain mindset going into it because the writing is so abstract and needs concentration! The world-building and characters were good too. I think it is a hit or miss kind of book that is not for all readers! But worth giving a chance!
3037670740	You can find my full spoiler-free book review video hereWhat did I just read...??Oooh boi this book. I really wanted to love it, but had a wisp of apprehension present when going into it. It appears that apprehension was justified. This book can only be described as whimsical happenings. Not a plot per say, nor a great deal of attention to falling in love with the characters. Just...kinda strange things happening, and you witnessing. So many times I would pause a think "why are you telling me this though?" I never did get an answer. Despite being 500+ pages long, I would struggle to pin the key points of the plot because there wasn't one in the typical sense. At no point did anxieties raise or the pace quicken. There wasn't really an antagonist to defeat. As I said, it was just a case of things happening, and you watching.This to me was the sort of book I'd appreciate more as a thing to study. It can't be denied that great care was fuelled into this book, with words chosen purposefully and this careful construction of oddities forming a literal sea of whimsy. I could consider the book an interesting experiment, to have a fantasy book without an antagonist for instance. But sadly, whimsy alone is not enough to keep my attention. And while the care in language can be noted, I found myself bored of the excessive use of words more than anything. So many sentence could've been a line long, but were instead four lines, only to portray the exact same image just in intense detail. It was tedious at times.I could go on about all the ways this book didn't work for me, but the video linked above will explain the nuances of it better than I can here. I'll just leave it by saying I'm sad about not loving this book, especially after adoring The Night Circus, but I can see why so many people to love it.

3040957454	The most boring person on earth is recruited into a masochistic secret society of librarians. One of the many tests one takes to become a member, is to guard a book for a few minutes. To pass this test, you have to watch the book until somebody comes to pick it up and then say "hey, please leave that book alone, somebody else has their eye on it."Eventually, some folks pass all the tests and are asked whether or not they're ready to die for all this librarianism. If you agree and accept, they give you a tattoo and cripple you. If you decline, they jam a tattoo needle into your heart and kill you. That passage stuck with me for about 100 pages. Would it really be such a bad way to go? Surely, it's a better way than death by lack of pace, narrative style, and characterization.

Oh, where would I be if I didn't have you to read with, Lilah ?! ❤️Edit: the kinda book I might rate more after a reread.𝐀𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐓 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐁𝐎𝐎𝐊This book is chaotic. The vibe it has given me is very much like a complex, mature, and (maybe) a high fantasy version of, "Alice's adventures in Wonderland". It's about stories within stories and the connection between them. There are also different versions of the same story. There are a lot of lines, and maybe things/situations that a lot of readers can relate to and feel comfortable with. I also think that saying this book has some time travel, would be appropriate. That's not a spoiler, (imo). I think, it might give anyone who decides to read this book, some clarity knowing what's awaiting them in the book.Writing Style:5★ to this! This is the one thing that I loved from the beginning of the book and till the end. It's all flowery and very much literary. (thanks to this book, I learned some new words, which might help me in life someday.) It's so atmospheric, that you can literally feel, see, imagine and be lost while reading. Its mostly slow paced but sometimes, things happen suddenly. And, the most important thing is the metaphors. There are so many, that if you try to binge read this book, you'll either dnf, be confused, (which you will be, anyway) or won't understand what means what.Our Protagonist:ZACHARY EZRA RAWLINSThe guy who finds an unusual book in a library that he starts reading out of curiosity, and finds one of his own childhood story written in it. A boy at the beginning of a story has no way of knowing that the story has begun. This guy gets curious to find some answers, and ends up involved in a huge mess. But he's just so dumb, he does what everyone says. He doesn't question. He easily trusts. Because, when you see a fantasy come true, you stop questioning? As soon as there’s an unquestionable truth there’s no longer a myth. World building:Umm... There's not . . . a...?? The world is strange and endings are not truly endings no matter how the stars might wish it so. Well, there's the underground wonderland. And, there's the world in stories. Imo, the world in stories is much clear. While the real world aka surface in this book, and the underground world, (I call wonderland) doesn't have much. There are definitely doors, and doorknobs, and tunnels and rooms, which are part of the world so yes, they're . . . Great? Idk. Some things are explained, some forgotten even by the author, and some are half said, half left unsaid. It's like the author created this world in a way where readers can just give the story a new (their own) shape in their heads.𝗦𝗣𝗢𝗜𝗟𝗘𝗥 𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚My thoughts/opinionsone:I think the reason this book was so good for me, was not the story or the plot because that's not even something I saw in this book. Instead, it's the idea of the story and what the plot could be? It's the idea that the author shared and the ideas the came in my mind unconsciously, while reading. The idea of a painter painting magical doors, the idea of what might have happened to the characters who are mentioned just once. Like, the sword smith or the key collector.twoI think that Erin wrote some lines specifically for those who didn't or couldn't or failed to understand the fantasy in this book, the way she had it in her head. I think she used those lines to make the confused people (me) feel that it's okay to feel that way. Some of those lines are: Not all stories speak to all listeners, but all listeners can find a story that does, somewhere, sometime. In one form or another. I think that's very true. I also think, she wrote it to justify her book too. That if her book and stories don't speak to us, it's just okay coz it's not *our cup of tea*. I haven't figured out the puzzle yet even though I don't know what the puzzle is. That's exactly what I thought and felt! Zachary yawns. If he's going to read the whole book he's going to need caffeine. That's me and Lilah (my buddy reader) everytime we picked this book! I think I had the most tea and coffee while reading this book. I can't forget the headache it gave me for two days. Slowly they attempt to sort through a thousand questions. For every connection they make between one book and another there are more that don’t fit. Some stories seem completely separate and distant and others feel explicitly connected to the story they have found themselves in together now. Omg that's literally us!! Both, me and Lilah .. the only difference is that the characters are sorting stories that they are in and we are sorting everything including their stories too! “Who do you think is the pirate?” he asks.“I think the pirate is a metaphor.”“A metaphor for what?”“I don’t know,” Zachary says. I laughed so hard reading this coz so many times, while sharing theories, Lilah and I talked like this. We're like, what does that mean, then we tell each other maybe it means *that* and then we're asking, what's *that* exactly? 😂 . . .everything keeps repeating and becoming more confusing when it should be getting clearer. See my point? How funny, to relate with your protagonist on the most annoying of things? that's page 382 btw.Rant + QuestionsOkay, first problem. There's an issue with the placement of comma's. It's a bit irritating.Can we please, ever get the meaning of symbols? Why isn't there a meaning to it? To what sign you get when you roll the dice. To what door you decide to open? I would have really like the symbols to have a meaning to indicate something. Historically the dice have been rolled to see what kismet has to say about a new arrival to this place. For a time the results were used to gauge potential for paths. Hearts were for poets, those who wore their hearts open and aflame. Long before that they were used by storytellers and rolled to nudge a story toward romance or tragedy or mystery. Their purpose has changed over time but there were bees before there were acolytes and swords before there were guardians and all of those symbols were here before they were ever carved upon dice.. . .Each of us has our own path, Mister Rawlins. Symbols are for interpretation, not definition. But, how do we even interprete? Anyway, can someone please explain this ending to me? So many people, who loved, who didn't understand, and who were confused while reading this book, all seem to be happy and satisfied with this ending but I just don't see why and how? What am I missing?Okay, cool. Some stories were irrelevant but they were really good and the author wanted to write so we would read and I really enjoyed those so, no complains about irrelevant stories. But why keep everything mysterious when it doesn't have to be? I love mystery solving but I don't get it here.Why didn't Mirabel ever tell Zach anything?What are we supposed to make of Allegra being as close to a mom to Mirabel and Dorian, as they could ever have? Why did Dorian try to kill Mirabel once and why Allegra, being like a mom to him, try to kill Dorian?What are we supposed to make of Allegra painting her last painting and crying and never painting again?Why do, some doors, when two people step through together, take them both different places and in different times?Why did Zachary have to die???Why did the starless sea have to collapse everything and what exactly did it mean, if that happened?How exactly, did Dorian place the beating heart inside Zach?So the owls were all humans? Why were we led to think it's all metaphors when they're all actually PEOPLE!!So, Zach is now gonna be happy with his insta-Love while Kat is off wandering in the harbor?Since the harbor is full of the Starless Sea, (honey) does that mean that Kat will be drowned in honey over there?There are other questions, but my brain is mostly dead writing all this. Maybe I'll edit soon and clarify a bit more of my problems.—not that anyone's interested.

3661084337	wow. I need to talk about it. I hav so much to say. wtf. WOW
3437020139	5 ⭐️ ma se potessi gliene dare molte altre!Il mare senza stelle è un libro che, come il pirata e la ragazza dell’inizio, è tutto una metafora e un simbolo da decifrare.Il mare senza stelle è un romanzo in cui vengono raccontate tante storie, favole e miti che durante la narrazione si intrecciano fra loro creando una storia incredibilmente suggestiva e sensoriale.Sto cercando ancora di mettere tutti i pezzi al loro posto per cercare di formulare un pensiero coerente su questa lettura, probabilmente ci vorrà del tempo.Quello che posso affermare con certezza è che Il mare senza stelle è uno dei romanzi più belli che io abbia letto negli ultimi anni. Indimenticabile, immaginifico e superbo nel raccontare una storia che parla di libri, di destino e dell’umanità stessa.
3040958970	Actual rating: 3.5 stars“We are all stardust and stories.”I adore The Night Circus, and have been eagerly anticipating Morgenstern’s sophomore novel for eight years. I really should have tempered my expectations. The Starless Sea is the type of book that, in the beginning, I believed would evoke strong feelings. You should either love it and be completely entranced by the atmospheric quiet of the tale, or be bored to tears by the apparent lack of action and a more common pacing. That’s what I expected when I read the first few pages. Unfortunately, if fell short for me. Instead of either loving or hating it, I mostly just find myself disappointed by it. “If all endings are beginnings, are all beginnings also endings?”Morgenstern can paint a picture with words unlike almost any other author I’ve experienced. There is a lushness to her writing that enchants me, and I can see everything she describes. I delight in the worlds she has created. The settings and premise of this book are absolutely fantastic. The idea of a secret world of stories is always a thrilling trope, and Morgenstern had a truly unique take on it that I found fascinating. The Starless Sea and its multitude of past and present Harbors are places that I would dearly love to visit. I swear I could taste the honey and smell the forgotten stories. It sounds like heaven. There were so many small-scale, unique settings within the scope of the Starless Sea that you could explore forever and never stop finding new depths to plumb. Along with its predecessor, The Starless Sea is one of the most atmospheric books I’ve ever read; creating a unique and compelling atmosphere is without a doubt Morgenstern’s biggest strength as an author. If storytelling can be a lullaby, she is one of the best in the business.“Strange, isn’t it? To love a book. When the words on the pages become so precious that they feel like part of your own history because they are.”Besides the beautifully described settings, my favorite element of this book was the fact that it wasn’t just one book. In each section, Morgenstern divided the story between Zachary’s current story and a book of fairy tales or a diary or some other book unique to that particular section. The fairy tales that Morgenstern crafted were wholly original and absolutely beautiful. The ideas of the Moon and the innkeeper, of Time and Fate, of the Owl King and his domain, were every one of them lovely and enchanting and thought provoking. Morgenstern created her own mythos, deep and wild and utterly unique, and it fueled the story. If I could somehow find a book of just these fairy tales, I give copies out like candy and would read them over and over again.“Everyone wants the stars. Everyone wishes to grasp that which exists out of reach. To hold the extraordinary in their hands and keep the remarkable in their pockets.”If this book was so beautifully written, so original in setting and lore, why didn’t I adore it? My disappointment can be found in two foundational elements: characterization and pacing. Actually, my displeasure stems from a lack of both. The characters were interesting and varied on the surface, but they had no depth. We were told of their depth, of their successes and losses and aches, but we were never actually shown these things. Morgenstern excels at presenting a setting in such a way that her audience can truly visualize it, as I stated earlier. But for some reason, she seems unable to show us a character’s core instead of merely telling us about it. This results in cardboard characters against a stunning backdrop, which just doesn’t really work. There is even very little dialogue in proportion to the amount of exposition. “Be brave… Be bold. Be loud. Never change for anyone but yourself. Any soul worth its star-stuff will take the whole package as it is and however it grows.”Also, there never seemed to be any true action; the plot just moseyed from one event to the next. There was never a true sense of tension, which is odd for a story with high stakes, as The Starless Sea is revealed to have. Perhaps part of this comes from Morgenstern’s decision to write in third person present tense? This mixed with high levels of introspection can lead to the story feeling incredibly slow for some and totally immersive for others. Even the various romances felt as if they had no true foundation, which rendered them far less powerful than I believe was intended. I think she tried to make this book more than it is, when the story could have stood just fine on its own had it been allowed to do so.“We’re here to wander through other people’s stories, searching for our own.”Above all, this is a story about never passing up an opportunity; about the stories that shape us, whether they’re consumed from outside sources or told only within ourselves; about the importance of actually living your life instead of merely existing. Though the messages are profound, they were weakened by the lack of dimension within the characters. However, the atmosphere and exquisitely rendered settings and incredibly original and lush lore were compelling enough to ensure that this is a book I’ll end up revisiting someday. Perhaps I will see the characters in a different light and be able to include The Starless Sea among my favorites, along with Morgenstern’s The Night Circus. I recommend making sure that you’re in the proper mood for this book, ready for something atmospheric and lovely that meanders instead of races.“But this is not where their story ends. Their story is only just beginning. And no story ever truly ends as long as it is told.”You can find this review and more at Novel Notions.
3143169811	NEW FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME. THIS WAS MADE FOR ME.
2590862954	THE STARLESS SEA WILL SWEEP YOU AWAY 🌊⭐ ✨ Popsugar Reading Challenge 2019✨ ✨✨A book with a zodiac sign or astrology term in the title✨✨This book I had to take a few days to digest before I could figure out how I felt about it. At first I was annoyed that it took me far longer to read than I thought it would. But then I realised that it was simply because this book was so much more full than I had expected it to be. That is a great quality in a book! "Reading a book four times in one day is perfectly normal."- Zachary 👍 WHAT I LIKED 👍Stories: While the main story is of The Starless Sea and Zachary's journey there, there are so many other stories, small and big, that are woven into the tapestry of this book. It was masterfully and impressively done. I was hooked and had to figure out how all these stories were connected.Fairy tale: Many of the smaller stories had the distinct feeling of a fairy tale, which is something I really loved!Book-within-a-book: This is one of those things that can go both ways, I feel. Here, however, I enjoyed it.More books: Come on, you gotta love a universe based on books and a secret library! "[...] a little bit wrong is mostly right." Reference: Speaking of secret libraries - one of my favourite books is The Shadow of the Wind', a wonderful book with a secret library that is not only referenced in this book but, I have a feeling, also provided Morgenstern with a fair bit of inspiration. In a good way.End: Now, I will of course not give the ending away, I will just say that it was confusing in the best kind of way - the way that made it impossible to tell what was going to happen.Against the grain: Normally, these books feature a distinct good vs. bad conflict. This had the edge of it, but it was in no way the thing it revolved around. That was refreshing and interesting to read.Follow me for more book goodness: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram
3038158707	“Strange, isn’t it? To love a book. When the words on the pages become so precious that they feel like part of your own history because they are.”A reading experience:Me the first half of the book: Wow - this could be a new all-time favourite. The writing! The descriptions! It’s a book for book lovers. This might even be better than The Night Circus.Me the second half of the book: ...I’m confused. Am I meant to be following this? So. Many. Descriptions. Is this over yet? The Night Circus is definitely my favourite.I’m incredibly disappointed that I didn’t love The Starless Sea. It was amazing up until the point where I felt like I just couldn’t keep all the different strands and threads straight in my head. It was just TOO MUCH. And I still don’t get what the actual point was. If someone asked me to describe the plot I’d just be like “well... there’s this underground library thing... and it needs protected... for some reason”I’ve seen a few reviews likening it to Alice in Wonderland and that might explain my frustrations - I LOATHE Alice in Wonderland. Whimsical nonsense is not my thing. I need a plot that has a beginning, middle and end. Or if the plot is non-existent I need characters that I care about, and I just didn’t give a toot about anyone in this book - expect for Kat maybe. She was cool. Zachary, however, was the most flat protagonist. Yawn...I can’t remember the last time I felt so conflicted on a book, cos that first half was simply MAGICAL. It was so hard to put down, I wanted to live between the pages of this book forever. And then... I just dropped the ball, I guess, and became overwhelmed with it all - it happens!One thing I can’t fault is Morgenstern’s writing - even when it was heavily descriptive and just too much, it was still beautiful. Unfortunately it was also incredibly frustrating to wade through. I ran out of patience.The more I think about this book, the more issues I have, so I’m lowering my initial rating. Sorry to all those who loved this, like my buddy readers @thebookgeekboutique and @ab_reads, but I’m firmly team Night Circus. 3 stars.
3051697777	quite literally my favorite book ever i can and will reread this book again and again forever and ever ---at her book signing in seattle, morgenstern described her writing as "realistic magic", and the starless sea as a book about stories. and that is exactly what it is. the starless sea is a book about stories, for people who love stories and yearn to disappear into other worlds. in the same fashion as the night circus, i suspect it'll take me a couple of re-reads to truly understand the genius-ness of this book, and the many stories it entails. i was initially worried that i wouldn't love this as much as i loved the night circus, but if anything, i think i love it even more. i loved the way we got to see snippets of certain characters and their stories told in different ways, and how all these stories were interwoven and intertwined. i loved the way we got to learn so much about zachary and all the other characters, and the thorough descriptions - i truly felt like i was there with them all.
2942633744	"Everyone wishes to grasp that which exists out of reach. To hold the extraordinary in their hands and keep the remarkable in their pockets." A love letter to storytelling in all its forms, The Starless Sea is stunningly crafted with magic that will sweep you away into a fairytale. I'm completely in love with this masterpiece and already want to re-read it. If you love books that come together slowly, with lots of puzzle pieces, doors to other worlds, rich symbolism, deep mythology, and a fairytale quality, then this book might be for you. Truthfully, this is kind of my perfect book and it has been a long time since a book has transported me the way that this one did. While there are a multitude of players and pieces, the main character is Zachary Ezra Rawlins: graduate student, gay young man of color, son of a fortune-teller, and recipient of a mysterious book with a story from his childhood within its covers. Something he never told a soul. As a pre-adolescent, he once happened upon a magical painted door in an alleyway, and decided not to open it. But now, there might be another opportunity to open a door to another world, where he will be drawn into a mysterious and dangerous conflict full of shadowy players. I loved everything about this book, from the descriptive imagery to the quiet romance and the many nods to RPG video games in the vein of Dragon Age. Honestly, I would have loved this book anyway, but I am even more excited about the way it is a love letter to interactive storytelling in video game form. Scenes and plot elements throughout feel deeply inspired by these kinds of games, with quests and side quests, mini-mysteries that open hidden doors, and a larger idea woven throughout that all stories are the same story. In The Starless Sea, as in RPG video games, you can play a game as different characters, make different choices leading to different outcomes, but ultimately it is all part of the same story. Can I tell you how happy it makes me that more than one of my favorite books this year by female authors are inspired by video games?! My life is made. Some people will undoubtedly find this to be slow, boring, confusing, and frustrating. It may not be the book for everyone, but I savored every moment of it and cannot wait to re-read it and gain new insight into how everything fits together, now that I know the ending. If this sounds like your kind of book, I cannot recommend it enough, but don't expect to fly through it. I would usually read a book this size in 3 days or so, and this one took me 12. Enjoy the journey! Even better if you can find a friend to discuss and theorize with. I received an advance copy of this book for review. All opinions are my own.

2918510388	I have no idea what to say except huh??? This book was way too descriptive, full of metaphors and jumped around all over the place. It was so scrambled that it was hard to follow the story or even really get to know any of the characters. I honestly have no idea what the point of this book even was or what I just read. I was waiting for some big reveal to tie everything together...doesn't happen. It originally started out good and I was drawn in by the idea of finding a story about your life that was written a long time ago and the mystery of trying to figure it out; then things just got strange. This book is very poetic, I will give it that. A lot of the sentences sounded very pretty and I also enjoyed the fantastical, fairy tale type of magic. Some parts were genuinely beautiful.The love story with the main character is very strange in the sense that he hardly knows the person. He has barely talked to him and then they are just at the stage where they both deeply and comfortably love each other and feel like they have known each other for years. It didn't feel genuine at all. If you are really into poetry then you might enjoy this book as it reads more like poetry to me than a story. You definitely need to put a lot of time aside because it is the type of book you need to read slowly to really take it in.
3137399482	"Endings are what give stories meaning."OH. MY HEART. THIS BOOK. I for sure teared up at the end.This is a beautiful tribute to the stories that make up our lives and the ones we tell in fiction. Erin Morgenstern has a way of confusing the HECK out of you at the beginning with so many threads but it ALL. COMES. TOGETHER. I am so dang impressed with how she can weave a story and tie it all back together at the end.I also loved the meaning in there that there are chapters in our life for a reason and a season and those seasons don't last forever. BEAUTIFUL.I can't wait to reread this and catch everything I missed the first time around.reread for book club in jan 2020 and loved it just as much.
2587888301	| | blog | tumblr | ko-fi | |3.75 stars (rounded up to 4)secret libraries + magical doors + stories within stories within stories = my kind of book “A boy at the beginning of a story has no way of knowing that the story has begun.”This is the type of book that readers will either love or hater. Its playful style and recursive storytelling are definitely not for everyone. Within the first pages readers will realise whether they find this type of elusive narrative to be inviting or off-putting. Thankfully, in my case, I was perfectly happy to suspend my disbelief. “Do you believe in the mystical, the fantastical, the improbable, or the impossible? Do you believe that things others dismiss as dreams and imagination actually exist? Do you believe in fairy tales?”To me, The Starless Sea was not only a fun and entertaining read but one that wonderfully managed to pay homage to various forms of storytelling, often by incorporating and subverting established tropes and elements of the fantasy genre. Heavily inspired by fairy tales, myths, and—surprise surprise—video games, The Starless Sea takes its readers into a metatextual romp filled with books, stories-within-stories, and magic. “These doors will sing. Silent siren songs for those who seek what lies behind them.For those who feel homesick for a place they’ve never been to.Those who seek even if they do not know what (or where) it is that they are seeking.”This fantastical adventure has many beginnings, the most notable being perhaps the one in which Zachary Ezra Rawlins, arguably the novel's ‘true’ protagonist, comes across an odd book titled Sweet Sorrows. Zachary soon discovers that, not only is the book missing from the library’s catalogue, but that internet searches regarding it come up blank. Curiouser and curiouser still, Zachary believes that one of the chapters in Sweet Sorrows is about him. “He had thought there could be no stranger feeling than stumbling across a book that narrates a long-ago incident from his own life that was never relayed to anyone, never spoken about or written down but nevertheless is unfolding in typeset prose, but he was wrong.”Soon Zachary finds himself leaving the safety of his college life behind him in order to discover more about Sweet Sorrows. Secret organisations, book burnings, subterranean libraries, magical doors, pirates, men lost in time, mysterious entities, and many other-worldly things fill Zachary’s epic quest. Interspersed throughout his narrative arethe wondrous books he comes across, and the stories and characters within these books may be more real than not. “Zachary takes out the book. He turns it over in his hands and then puts it down on his desk. It doesn’t look like anything special, like it contains an entire world, though the same could be said of any book.” In many ways this novel struck me as a love letter to bibliophiles. Those who dream of walking into a wardrobe and finding themselves transported into a marvellous land or of falling down a rabbit hole and into Wonderland. There are many interconnected mysteries, some more slippery than others. In many ways Zachary’s quest echoes the classic hero’s journey. There is a call to adventure, supernatural aids, romance, transformations, revelations, and returns. Time and again Zachary finds himself having to solve puzzles in order to pull apart the mystery of a bee, a key, and a sword.“Slowly they attempt to sort through a thousand questions. For every connection they make between one book and another there are more that don’t fit. Some stories seem completely separate and distant and others feel explicitly connected to the story they have found themselves in together now.”As much as I loved Zachary and his adventure, I do think that certain elements within this novel could have been made more clear. I’m all for ambiguity and suspense but there were quite a few scenes that seemed unnecessarily cryptic. Yes, enigmatic statements and puzzling riddles sound cool enough...maybe less so when there are so many.While I enjoyed the novel’s story-within-story structure, I think that a greater focus on Zachary’s narrative would have strengthened some of the character dynamics (especially with the main two other characters, Dorian and Mirabel). Towards the end of the book we suddenly get snippets from a character that up to that point had remained rather on the outskirts...and I didn’t really much care for those sections (if anything they interrupted the momentum of Zachary's quest). Erin Morgenstern’s writing style is brimming with wonderful descriptions and possesses a very strong storyteller quality. For example, the beginning of her chapters seem to have been worded in a way that echoes the openings of fairy-tales. The lovely rhythm of her prose is entrancing and extremely readable. It may appear simple but it provides us with some vibrant scenes. Not only do the locations and clothes within this novel create a beautiful aesthetic but they often carry intertextual references. The Starless Sea is a modern and self-aware take on some well-worn and well-loved tales, one that I recommend to fans of Neil Gaiman, V.E. Schwab, Maggie Stiefvater, and Catherynne M. Valente. It may not have moved me as much as The Night Circus but I nevertheless enjoyed reading it. I was pretty excited when the narrative mentioned some of my favourite authors (Donna Tartt, Sarah Waters, and Shirley Jackson) and when it referred to some of my favourite childhood stories.Given how much I liked Zachary, I would happily read this novel again. And perhaps a second reading will make me love and understand the various stories even more.“Zachary recalls innumerable fairy-tale warnings against eating or drinking in underworlds and at the same time realizes he is incredibly thirsty.He suspects this is the only way forward.”
2783864710	This is the best book you’ll ever read in the next 10 years. I said it.But no one can compare such magic, emotional and devotion to stories, storytelling, fables, myths and the deep need of them. It’s a love letter, a love story, a prayer, an ode, an hymn.
5523594058	4.5 stars “We are the stars,” he answers, as though it is the most obvious of facts afloat in a sea of metaphors and misdirections. “We are all stardust and stories.” Books about books, about stories, about quests, about adventures, about the beauty of storytelling, and just the beauty of words? That’s my aesthetic!I can’t believe I’ve been delaying reading this for so long because I didn’t like the night circus. Because this?? This was just so beautiful. The writing that I thought was “too flowery” in the night circus was simply poetic and perfect in this book. This is a book about stories that are meant to be told, about the paths we create and where they lead us. Strange, isn’t it? To love a book. When the words on the pages become so precious that they feel like part of your own history because they are. This won’t be for everyone, but I savored it. It was magical, beautiful, and atmospheric. I’m incapable of putting my feelings of this book into words. This is a book that is meant to be experienced. I loved it. “And no story ever truly ends as long as it’s told.”
3055338255	Having just reread “The Night Circus” in preparation to reading this I was immediately excited that it contains that same sense of fantastical, magic narrative that is shrouded in mystery. When Zachary Ezra Rawlins was eleven, he found a painting of a door on a brick wall. The door is in an alley that he uses as a shortcut to school. Most times the walls are covered with graffiti, but today there is this door. On the door there are three symbols. At head height in the centre, a bee, underneath this a key, and lastly underneath the key, a sword. The doorknob glows and seems almost real. The keyhole looks so real it looks as if it could receive a key. Being an eleven-year old he still believes in magic and in his gut, he knows that this door is real, and leads somewhere magical. And yet something stops him as he reaches to turn the knob returning his hands to his pockets. The next day, again using the shortcut of the alley on his way to school he is disappointed to find that the door has been painted over. He feels like he has missed a chance, but a chance at what? Nine years later and Zachary is at University visiting the library, working his way through books to bring some relief from his master’s degree in media. He is looking in the W section as he has recently discovered Sarah Waters. As there is only one book available by her at this moment, The Little Stranger (if you haven’t read it, you should it’s excellent), he starts looking around for some other books to take instead. Something almost calls him to reach up to the top shelf where he finds a book covered in deep burgundy cloth. It has no author. Upon opening the book, he finds that it is titled Sweet Sorrows.When he gets home and starts to read it, it seems like it is a collection of short stories. When he gets to the third story he is transported back to that day when he was eleven and using the ally to get to school. The third story of the book is a chronicle of the day he found the painted door in the alley. It’s completely accurate and there is no doubt that it is his story. How can this be? He reads feverishly hoping to find what happens? What is behind the door? But regrettably the story ends as it did that day with him refusing to open the door. Again, he feels that he has missed some magical opportunity.He reads the book three times. Most of the book tells of a fantastical underground library. He knows, although if asked he would not be able to explain why, that the door he failed to open a decade ago led to this library. Did this book come from that Library?The narrative structure will use alternating chapters. One chapter devoted to Zachary and his quest to find the Starless Sea, the next, will be a chapter from the mysterious novel. The book will be used as a narrative device to fulfil multiple tasks. Firstly, it is full of fantastical stories of every type of genre, and some of these stories are worthy of novellas or short stories themselves. Most of them are exquisitely written. As the reader you will probably find yourself looking forward to the next story while fully immersed in the primary narrative of Zachary. It also works to explain what the Starless sea is, and the significance of the three symbols, representing the three classes of the Starless sea. The bee for the acolytes, the sword for the guardians, and the key for the keepers. All roles are different but equally vital for the sustaining of the underground library. The Starless sea used to be teeming with people, dancing in the surf having parties. But then it receded, it has changed, the doors crumbled away, a vacant library devoid of readers. Nobody stays here anymore.This book is full to the brim with magic and fantasy. It almost feels like the covers are struggling to keep this magic within the book and unlike “The Night Circus” I think that there is so much magic in this book that it may indeed alienate readers whose taste is a little averse to a large degree of magic in their story. However, if you love magic and books, then the world that Erin Morgenstern has created here is almost a reader’s utopia. A reader’s utopia, and a book for lovers of books,“It takes Simon a moment to realise the keeper refers to the gold-edged book in his hand. “I wanted to read it,” Simon explains, though it seems obvious. What else would he want to do with a book? Though it is not quite true. He wants to do more than read it. He wants to study it. He wants to savour it. He wants to use it as a window to see inside another person. He wants to take the book into his home, into his life, into his bed because he cannot do the same with the girl who gave it to him.”The list of characters is short, but this is beneficial to the novel, enabling Morgenstern to devote time and chapters on bringing these magical characters to life and show the reader their history and place in the narrative. You could use the same adjectives to describe all of them. Dorian, Mirabel, Allegra, Simon, all equally enigmatic and mysterious in their own ways and all integral to the plot.At times you may find yourself confused and lost in a magical miasma. Is Dorian working with Allegra, or are they enemies? Why is Allegra closing all the doors denying access to the Starless Sea from everybody? Why is the Starless Sea now empty?However, stick with it. I found myself baffled at times, going back and rereading chapters to make connections as if I was lost in the underground library myself. But Morgenstern has you right where she wants you and as you get deeper into the narrative, she will connect timelines, narratives, stories, and it all comes together magnificently. You cannot help but admire the effort that Morgenstern has put into the narrative. Upon finishing, I almost forgave her for taking so long to publish this wonderful second novel.Although I loved this book it didn’t quite reach the heights that “The Night Circus” did for me, but that is more of a compliment to “The Night Circus” than a criticism of “The Starless Sea”I love the fact that “Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell” by Susanna Clarke, one of my favourite books, makes a little cameo appearance.A wonderful magical read for lovers of stories and books. 4.5 Stars.If you are a big fan of Morgenstern like me there is a wonderful video of her talking about The Starless Sea and writing on my blog here - https://www.collinsbookblog.com/post/...
3280150521	Buddy read with RuthieStarless Sea is the most whimsical, magical and weirdest book I've ever read. It's like Alice in Wonderland,Neverwhere,Caraval and The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender all rolled into one with its own strange plot. She found she no longer minded that the stories would linger. That some enjoyed them and others did not but that is the nature of a story. Not all stories speak to all listeners, but all listeners can find a story that does, somewhere, sometime. In one form or another. Starless Sea is the best execution of a book within a book that I have ever read. It's not only a book within a book but stories within stories. I spent the first 40% of reading this book torn between confusion, annoyance and enjoyment. This book wrung the above emotions from me. Lots of stories was going on at the same time. The only constant was that of Zachery Ezra Rawlins who is the protagonist. So even though I did not understand the other stories I know exactly what was happening to him.This book features lots of themes but the major is believe, to believe in the impossible. The friendship here is also admirable, the romance in this book is too insta love for me. There was no build up whatsoever, it just crept up on me, one moment they met the next thing I know they are in love. My second theme in this book is love for books and story, I love books so I could totally relate. “Be brave,” she says. “Be bold. Be loud. Never change for anyone but yourself. Any soul worth their star-stuff will take the whole package as is and however it grows. Don’t waste your time on anyone who doesn’t believe you when you tell them how you feel." I like the writing style, most of the book was written in Zachery's point of view but the book within the book was narrated by an unseen narrator, though it was easy to understand it was a bit confusing because there was no relationship with the main plot at first but that changed when the main plot started showing connections to the story within the story. I love how the author connected it all. Sadly this book is open ended my worst kind of ending. I love when authors let the readers decide their own endings but this is too much.The characters in this book were numerous, it's no surprise that my favourite character is Zachery Ezra Rawlins, he is a weird and queer guy, I really enjoyed reading his character development. Dorian, Mirabel and Kat were also good characters even though Kat was only in the beginning and ending of the book.The plot is similar to that of the books I mentioned in my opening paragraph but unlike those ones this is my unique because of its prose. The Starless Sea is a magical underground library where the doors to the place are in the most inconspicuous of places. You need to believe there is something more to it before the door will open for you and lead you to the Starless Sea. Zachery first discovered it as a child but didn't believe enough to try and open the door. Now as an adult he has a second chance but there is organisation that aims to destroy all the doors that leads to the Starless Sea.

2878225927	This book had strong five star potential at the beginning because the writing was so lyrical and the unfolding of the story was so enjoyable. I knew that if the story came full circle and tied up nicely, there'd be no doubt that this would be a new favorite of the year. But instead, the ending was meandering and created more questions than it answered, and after 500 pages I still didn't understand the purpose of this world or what really just happened. I like that the main character was into video games so a lot of the plot read like solving a puzzle, but the world was so vast and under-explained. Similar to the characters, I felt lost within it. Sometimes I like stories that leave you confused (Polar Express, I'm looking at you), but I can't quite wrap my head around this one and also don't care enough to Google it and figure it out.
4108574811	I have a lot of flaws, thousands of them, but one thing is sure: I'm not a quitter.Okay, maybe I am, but not with books; if I start a book I have to read it all. There are no grey areas, there is no book so awful I can't finish. My brain is programmed to go till the end, or I can't have peace of mind. It's just who I am, and the reason why sometimes I stumble in bad books and I still have to read them. Till the end. This is how I imagine hell, actually.This little introduction brings us here, the second book of Erin Morgenstern.The first one, The Night Circus, wasn’t really memorable, I still don't get the hype around that book, but it's something I would recommend to some people.The Starless Sea, instead, is one of the worst books I've ever read. Fairytales and magic are mixed up in this… novel.There is the main story (Zachary’s), and then there are other tales in there: the first part is composed of the stories of the book Zachary found in the College’s library; the second part is composed of the stories of Dorian’s book; the third part is the story of Mirabel’s parents; the fourth part are nightmares and bad thoughts wrote on paper’s stars you can find everywhere in the Bay; the fifth part is the story of the Owl King (which I didn't understand), and the last one is made of the secret notes from Zachary’s friend because he‘s missing and she knows there’s something weird about it.Are you confused? Welcome to the last month of my life.Usually, there is always a starting moment when you don't understand what's going on in the story but all you have to do is keep going. Not just in fantasy books, also in thrillers and even romance. I did that, I kept reading to find the meaning of it, and then it ended. The book ended and I still don't get what was it. What I've just read. There are 500-ish pages of a boring and confusing story, embellished with nice quotes, that doesn't even end properly. Even fairytales have a better ending than this one because they have one!Also, half of it could be easily cancelled by adjusting the author’s narrative style.First of all, no one needs so many pages of descriptions, even the most famous fantasy book has fewer descriptions than this. The outfits, the people, the thoughts, the rooms, the damn weather. I think she didn't reread her book, or she’d have known how annoying is it.Secondly, isn't she capable of creating a narration when she doesn't always stop? There is a phrase. Period. To head. Another phase. Period. To head. Till the end.With my whole heart, I think her ideas can be great but she needs to make develop them by someone else.I'm not mad because I actually believed I’d have liked this, I'm upset because I have so many questions and no answer: where are Zachary and Dorian? Is he ever came back home? Where is Kat going? Who is Mirabel?I have so many more thoughts but I don't know how to express them without sounding crazy, so I'll just let you read the book. If you must.↠ 2 stars
3121075764	1.5 stars. This is my second and final Erin Morgenstern book. Having read nearly 900 cumulative pages of her writing, I feel justified in saying that it is not for me. Every issue I had with The Night Circus was magnified in The Starless Sea: the striking imagery that, strung together, still doesn't add up to an actual plot; the agency-less characters who move through their own stories like somnambulists; the affected writing. Look - I don't care if comma splices ARE a trademark quirk of Morgenstern's writing. Every single one reads to me like a pinkie nail dragged across a minute sliver of chalkboard. The story starts promisingly enough. Reclusive graduate student Zachary Ezra Rawlins opens an antique book at the library and is astonished to find himself in it - the story of a painted door that appeared one day near his house and that he didn't try to open and regretted. It's his story, down to every detail, but how could it be in a book much older than he is? Cue strange societies, stories within stories, hidden worlds, melting realities, seas made of honey, etc., etc. I should like a lot of this. I should like Zachary Ezra Rawlins, as a fellow solitary reader, and I do identify with "the impulse to say no that Zachary has for pretty much anything that involves talking to people." There is a library, with cats, and a marvelous sentient Kitchen that conjures up all the dumplings. There is much in here about storytelling and reading, and the occasional acute observation or scintillating image. But there are also bits like this:a paper star that has been unfolded and refolded into a tiny unicorn but the unicorn remembers the time when it was a star and an earlier time when it was part of a book and sometimes the unicorn dreams of the time before it was a book when it was a tree and the time even longer before that when it was a different sort of starI just can't. I hate the sentimental twee-ness, the wink-and-nod narrative parentheticals, the many one sentence paragraphs that are supposed to be artsy. I never cared about our milquetoast hero and his hipster sweaters and linen pants and tall skim milk matcha lattes. Even the cats are disappointing. The final 1/3 of the book is a hot mess of owls, bees, half-baked symbolism, and dream-like sequences. Unfortunately, the imagery is insufficient to obfuscate the hot-mess-ness of it all. "What is happening right now?" Zachary wonders to himself at one point. I answered aloud, "Who the eff knows?" Patricia McKillip or Catherynne Valente could have pulled this off, but Erin Morgenstern doesn't.The Starless Sea would have been a DNF if it hadn't been the only book I had checked out from the library before everything was shut down for quarantine. I have now had difficulty finishing Erin Morgenstern books while on vacation and while under shelter-in-place orders, so I think it's time to move on.
3069262300	DNF - Is there even a plot to this book? Nothing has happened so far, and I'm giving up. The writing is padded to the hilt with minutea of completely unimportant descriptions that it's hard to wade through it all. If it can be written in one sentence, this book writes it in ten. The main story is broken up every chapter by seemingly random asides. If this book wasn't so long, I'd try to tough it out to reach the end, but I can't make it through 500 pages of this.
3352675671	Plenty of stories claim to contin magic. The Starless Sea is one of the most convincing portrayals I’ve read. A completely entrancing tale. “There are so many pieces to a person. So many small stories and so few opportunities to read them.” The Starless Sea is above all else a story about stories.Zachary Ezra Rawlins believes himself to be a person without purpose. On an otherwise ordinary day he comes across an authorless novel detailing magical tales, some of which are startlingly similar to his own past. This spikes great intrigue in Zachary, and a world of doors are opened to him. When he comes across another lost soul similar to himself --a man named Dorian-- the two go in search of the Starless Sea, a place stories go to begin and end.The first half of this novel was full of scepticism on my part. The ethereal touch in Morgenstern’s writing was a shock unlike anything I’ve experienced; it was hard to become accustomed to such graceful storytelling.By the second half I’d entered a beautiful haze, completely absorbed in the magic touching each page. Zachary was the perfect vessel for readers, I had the most wonderful time experiencing the Starless Sea through him.Zachary and Dorian’s gradual love was gorgeous to see unravel. The progression was paced perfectly, adding a whole other layer of magic to the tale unfolding. Dorian in particular struck me with his otherworldly aura. His character, despite being human, gave off an effortless yet convincing image full of grace and magic.The writing was what pulled each piece of this wondrous puzzle together. The contrast between Zachary’s perspective and the fairytale-like chapters interspersed between the overarching story made for something indescribable.Above all else, this is a book that cannot be explained, rather experienced. Entrancing and sure to sweep readers away.

2588437732	No spoilers in this rapid review of The Starless Sea. Overall, I was not a fan. I give it 2.5 stars. This is Morgenstern’s second novel, and The Night Circus, her debut, is my all-time favorite book. Sea was my most anticipated release of the year, yet I don’t think it suffered from my high expectations. It just didn’t work for me, and it hurts my heart to say this.The Starless Sea is about books, stories, and libraries. It’s an ode to the people who love them. And it started out with promise. Zachary Ezra Rawlins finds a book with no author in his university library and begins digging into the mystery surrounding it. Who wrote it? Who is the mysterious donor who gave this book and others to various libraries? And why does it contain a very specific story from his childhood? I started out intrigued by the mystery and marveling at how Ezra’s story unfolds. I enjoyed the interludes with fairy tales and fables sprinkled in. They seemed disconnected, but I knew they must have deeper meaning. I couldn’t wait to discover how it all came together as we plunged further into Ezra’s metaphorical rabbit hole. Yet the deeper I went, the crazier it got and the less meaning I gleaned. I tried to sort through the interweaving tales—Ezra’s, the fables, and the brief flashbacks/forwards—working to determine what was important and what exactly was going on. I held onto hope until the very end that a big reveal would tie it all together. This didn’t happen. The moments that perhaps should’ve had dramatic impact fell flat for me. A friend of mine (and fellow Morgenstern enthusiast) told me she felt like it was a poem she didn’t fully understand. Touché, Mary!Sea is written in Morgenstern’s imaginative, gorgeous prose. Yet this time, it seemed she was trying a tad too hard, maybe working to recapture the magic she created in her debut. I’ve often said that if I had written The Night Circus, I would’ve said something along the lines of, “There you go, world. You’re welcome. I can’t top this masterpiece.” But I don’t want Morgenstern to stop writing! I’ll read her next book despite my disappointment in this one.If you’re in the mood for an original story filled with beauty and magic from a New York Times bestseller, I suggest starting with The Night Circus. Please read it if you haven’t! And then pick up The Starless Sea if you fall in love with Morgenstern’s creativity and style. Maybe it will resonate with you far more than it did with me.

3037210881	2 bored stars ★★✩✩✩ This book is for you if… you've enjoyed Erin's previous book. If you didn't like The Night Circus you sure as hell won't become a fan of hers reading this book. ⤐ Overall.The only reason this isn't a one-star review is the fact that it didn't have anything in me that angered me to an abnormal degree. To people who know me and my taste, this will come to no surprise: I found this book utterly unsatisfying and have no idea what happened.In all seriousness: explain to me in less than 10 sentences what the plot of this book actually is. I wasted a lot of time hoping Erin would have the decency to wrap everything up in the end ... HA! JOKE'S ON ME SHE DIDN'T.At first, I honestly doubted myself thinking I was too unsophisticated to wrap my mind around her book but I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing to understand. The Starless Sea reads like Erin Morgenstern desperately searched for and found an opportunity to squeeze all the weird and incomplete stories she ever came up with in between the front and back cover of one book. Ladies, Gents, everyone in between and everyone outside of that binary, familiars, ghosts, I give you a complete disappointment.I'm not fond of meandering around with the plot of a book as it is but reading The Starless Sea was pure torture. What disguised itself as novel and quite alluring in the beginning was just row after row after row of words seemingly put together at random with some cute prose in between to keep up the facade of excitement.⤐ What’s happening. ‘Climbing is not for girls.’‘Anything is for girls.’ [This is the only quote I noticed throughout the entire book.]My summary is this: Zachary, 25-year-old university student of Game Making finds his way to a mysterious underground library of unimaginable expanse in which he finds lots of stories whose threads will absolutely not connect in the end._____________________2 STARS. Definitely a disappointment. It might not even have been worth to finish for a variety of reasons.
3164160091	Dnf @ 48%THIS COULD’VE BEEN A LITERARY GENIUS OF A BOOK! Seriously I wrote that in all caps cause I’m literally screaming it. The writing was GORGEOUS! The prose was 👌🏽. This book was stories within stories. It’s a portal fantasy where there is another world thats filled with books. I’ve seen a lot of reviews mention that if you’re a “true Booklover” then you’ll love this book as it pays homage to storytelling. I completely disagree. I’m a HUGE Booklover and I couldn’t finish this one. THERE WAS NO PLOT! I’ve never met such a passive hero. While I liked him, he didn’t ask any questions. Come on Zachary Ezra Rollins...if you are in another world wouldn’t you ask questions? Well he didn’t. He was just going with the flow. As I kept reading I kept wondering “what is going on?” And finally when I would feel like I have the hang of it, the story would change, something would pop up and I’d feel like an idiot again. I’m very smart, actually there are times when I consider myself to be genius level smart😌 but this book made me feel like a dummy. I tried to trudge through it. I tried. But imagine you’re wearing a backpack with 20 10-pound weights in the backpack. That’s what it feels like reading this book. I woke up feeling heavy and weighted and that’s when I knew it was time to dnf. Do I recommend this? NO! FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT’S HOLY AND GOOD. DO. NOT. WASTE. YOUR. TIME!

3241120521	Bezhviezdne more je kniha pre pravých knihomoľov. Ktorých spomienky sú pretkané knižnicami, kníhkupectvami a antikvariátmi. Pre ktorých sú knihy to jediné útočisko a s hrdinami sa pri každej možnej príležitosti vydávajú za nečakanými dobrodružstvami a v ústrety nejasnej budúcnosti. Pre ľudí, ktorí na stránkach kníh opúšťajú tento svet, aby objavili niečo nové a nevídané alebo navštívili niečo staré a dobre známe. Pre ľudí, ktorí knihami žijú a dýchajú. Hlavná postava Zachary Ezra Rawlins je presne taký univerzitný študent. S nosom zahĺbeným v knihe v každej voľnej chvíli. Kým mu do rúk nepadne útla knižočka, na ktorej stránkach on sám ožije. Veď to je predsa splnený sen každého knihomoľa. Posolstvo Bezhviezdneho mora tkvie v tom, že všetci v sebe skrývame príbeh hodný napísania. A prečítania. Ak očakávate knihu o Zacharym, ostanete sklamaní. Hlavnými hrdinami sú úplne iné postavy. Najlepšie to vystihol David Mitchell v Atlase mrakov slovami Sonmi~451: „Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.“ („Naše životy nie sú naše vlastné. Od narodenia až po smrť sú prepletené s ostatnými, s minulosťou i prítomnosťou. A s každým zločinom a každým dobrým skutkom tvoríme našu spoločnú budúcnosť.“) Bezhviezdne more nie je ľahké čítanie. Tým nie je autorka známa v literárnom svete. Hoci sa Zachary ocitne na stránkach kníh, stále sa vracia k iným knihám, aby sa nestratil v labyrinte svojho románu. Mnohí recenzenti kritizujú štruktúru románu, že je až príliš komplikovaná. Veď ako môže autorka chcieť, aby čitatelia pri jej knihách rozmýšľali? Niečo nepredstaviteľné. A pritom keby spomalili, dokázali by sa vydať po stopách príbehu a byť detektívom, ktorý medzi riadkami objaví, ako to vlastne bolo. A nie, vrahom naozaj nie je záhradník ;) Pre mňa je to jedna z mála kníh, ku ktorým sa budem pravidelne vracať, lebo pri každom čítaní objavím novú vrstvu príbehu, nie len Zacharyho, ale aj toho svojho. A aj o tom knihy sú. Nie o nich, ale o nás.
2786153014	This review and others @Bookerification Rating: 2 stars Here is the thing, I know exactly how ‘The Starless Sea’ is supposed to make me feel. I hear it repeatedly in Erin Morgenstern’s poetic writing - like the pause before a clearly expected applause. Yet, I do not feel that way. I do not feel the wonder, astonishment or pleasure I know I am supposed to feel. As each word washes over me and the story emerges like a rainbow after the rain, I feel nothing… but indifference. Why is that, I hear you ask? Good question! After giving this considerable thought I realised that I was far too busy being confused and/or annoyed to fully connect with the story. “A boy at the beginning of a story has no way of knowing that the story has begun.” Anyone who reads fantasy books knows that they tend to be fairly confusing at first as strange, new worlds and characters are introduced. Well, this book takes that initial confusion to a whole new level. That’s right! Forget mild confusion. Readers are given the wonderful gift of… utter confusion! Characters, plot, setting - all of these are difficult to define and so a deep, lasting confusion sets in. It seems that at least half of this book is spent just introducing the world and characters. In fact, it is not until around the halfway mark that a clear plot begins to emerge. This central plot is made even harder to discern by various tales and narratives that are woven in throughout the book. These tales repeatedly interrupt the core story and generally add very little. They simply served to lead readers back into a state of utter confusion by raising more questions than they answer. Coupled with the enigmatic plot is an excess of descriptions and details that attempt to create an "enchanting" atmosphere. Unfortunately, this information overload only serves to maim any fascination I initially had. The death of my fascination was then ensured by the reflective nature of this book which examines both the story it presents and the components of all stories in general. These reflections certainly make this book a homage to story-telling and literature, but failed to keep me engaged. “Everyone is a part of a story, what they want is to be part of something worth recording" You would think that a plot that took half the book to establish would be gripping and hard to put down as things finally start to come together. However, that was not what happened here. Since I had spent so much of this book confused and indifferent, I could not bring myself to care despite the emerging connections and clarity. Even the twists and reveals that cropped up along the way had very little impact on my indifference. The main character, Zachary Ezra Rawlins, did not fare any better. Personally, I found his character rather dull and one-dimensional. Yes, his desire for an adventure made him slightly relatable, but his passiveness only led to him being exploited by strangers. He even managed to fall in love with one of these strangers despite having very few interactions with this character. Like Zachery, the other characters in this book are very underwhelming and underdeveloped. Honestly, for most of the book, I got the names of two secondary characters mixed up and this made very little difference to the story. The only character I found fairly interesting is Katrina Hawkins. Although she only gets a few chapters towards the end of the book, it is clear that her character is very smart and not one to mess with. Ultimately, 'The Starless Sea’ is a book that demands the awe of readers through its creative flair and cryptic messages. It succeeds with this to a certain extent as readers are taken on a reflective journey accompanied by an ode to stories. However, the lacklustre plot and characters failed to sustain my initial fascination and drove me into a permanent state of indifference.___________________________RTC @ BookerificationRating: 2 stars “Not all stories speak to all listeners.”
3181809089	3.75 stars? Maybe? The reviews for The Starless Sea are all over the map, and honestly my feelings are too. It’s gorgeously written and mythic and obscure and frustrating at the same time. If you love poetic writing, symbolism and beautiful imagery (and I do!), and don't mind rather thin characters and meandering plots, give it a shot.Review to come, after I unpack all my thoughts and feelings.
3320642154	[3,75]”Everyone wants the stars. Everyone wishes to grasp that which exists out of reach. To hold the extraordinary in their hands and keep the remarkable in their pockets”.The Starless Sea es, sin duda, un libro peculiar. Desde que leí The Night Circus, hace más de siete años, supe que Erin Morgenstern tenía un talento muy especial para darle su propio toque a las historias que narra. Y es un toque que va entre lo mágico, lo onírico y aquello que crees que estás entendiendo, pero siempre queda un poco fuera de tu alcance. Es un estilo muy único el que tiene esta mujer. Y creo que, más que nunca, nos encontramos con él en este nuevo libro. Creo que esta es una historia muy difícil de definir. Si alguien me pregunta de qué va no sería capaz de darle una respuesta rápida. The Starless Sea va sobre libros e historias. Sobre hombres y mujeres que tienen una misión. Va sobre el Tiempo y el Destino. Sobre las estrellas y la luna. Sobre mitos y leyendas. Sobre puertos y corazones. Sobre secretos, sociedades, abejas, espadas, llaves y pinceles. Erin Morgenstern crea un entresijo de líneas de tiempo y de historias que sólo entendemos, de cierta manera, cuando cerramos el libro tras leer la última página. La búsqueda de un estudiante se entrelaza con una historia de amor que se perdió en las eras, con un pirata atrapado en un puerto, con un posadero enamorado de la Luna, con un chico perdido en un libro y con decenas de tramas más. Al principio, cuando recién estás empezando a leer The Starless Sea y ves cómo Zachary, poco a poco, se va viendo involucrado en algo que parece fuera de este mundo es imposible dejar de leer. Vas conociendo personaje tras personaje y tu cabeza empieza a conectar los hilos, a crear relaciones, teorías e hipótesis. Ahora, cuando ya has pasado de la mitad y sigues intentando descifrar qué está sucediendo en la trama es cuando tu cerebro se cansa. Para mí, leer The Starless Sea no fue relajante, sino desafiante. Desgasta un montón estar todo el tiempo tratando de entender qué tiene que ver el pirata con el Destino, o qué pintan las abejas con relación al Tiempo, o quién es en realidad la chica conejo. Seguir esa cantidad de pistas me dejó absolutamente exhausta y creo que, de cierta manera, hizo que no disfrutara tantísimo el libro. Y es algo muy triste, pues les juro que tuvo un inicio tan prometedor que pensé que se iría derecho a mi exclusiva lista de libros favoritos. Pero no. Díganme loca, pero yo tengo que disfrutar un libro de cabo a rabo para amarlo, tengo que sumergirme en sus páginas y olvidarme del mundo real, tengo que estar completamente en sintonía con una historia que vaya fluyendo y en la que todo vaya haciendo click en el momento adecuado. Pero la verdad es que The Starless Sea me daba dolor de cabeza a pesar de que sí que me gustaba la historia de Zachary y de Dorian. Ahora, no voy a negar que Erin Morgenstern tiene una habilidad casi sobrenatural para crear parajes completamente mágicos, esotéricos e inigualables. Las descripciones que nos da de una fiesta de máscaras, del Starless Sea, del Corazón, del Puerto o de las diferentes habitaciones por las que van apareciendo los personajes son excepcionales. Eso sí, nunca superará este escenario al que creó en The Night Circus. No les voy a decir que no lo lean, pero sí les voy a advertir que es un libro que demanda muchísima atención. Si no eres consciente de cada uno de los detalles que Erin Morgenstern introduce en la trama, ten por seguro que vas a sentirte súper perdido y el final te va a dejar indiferente, pues no lo habrás entendido. Creo que la clave para disfrutar de este libro, a pesar del gran esfuerzo mental que requiere, es precisamente notar cada palabra, cada conexión y cada guiño entre los mitos y relatos que se entrecruzan en la orilla del Starless Sea.
3079444967	See this review and more at my blog, The Scribe Owl!Thank you to Brianna and Laura for being completely outstanding buddy read partners!There aren't enough stars out there to giveThe Starless Sea is absolutely the best book I've ever read, which is not a title I give out lightly. One of the factors that drew me in most was its originality. The Starless Sea is a book that lives outside the constrictions of genres or the dictation of popular culture, and I've never read a book like it. Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he finds a mysterious book hidden in the back of his university library. But as he reads, he comes across something strange: a story about himself. Bewildered and overwhelmed, Zachary uncovers a series of clues--a bee, a key, and a sword-- that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, a secret club with a carefully protected collection of books, and through a door painted on the side of a building to an ancient library hidden far below the surface of the earth. While The Starless Sea was a perfect read for me, it's not the kind of book that works for everyone. What throws a lot of people off is the pacing. This book is not the kind that you can read quickly. Every sentence is important, and some passages take a reread to really understand. I had to read it slowly for a buddy read, and I think that actually enhanced my experience because I had to slow down and let it sink in. The other element that can lose some readers is the plot. I've even heard some people argue that there was no plot at all. The plot is just another element that requires patience. Very little of it is revealed at the beginning, or even until halfway through, and Erin Morgenstern never once communicated the end goal. You don't understand what Zachary is trying to do, or why he's there, but neither does he. Morgenstern keeps you in the dark just as much as her characters, which makes for an even more immersive experience.The atmosphere is a defining element of this beautiful novel. The Starless Sea is the kind of story whispered in the dark; a mysteriously whimsical tale of love and magic. The writing makes it feel like poetry, something to be so immersed in you forget to come up for air. Some readers have asked for a sequel after the open ending of The Starless Sea, but I think it's better to leave it a standalone. There's even a quote from the book that explains it perfectly: "I think the best stories feel like they’re still going, somewhere, out in story space." If you're not a fan of open endings and you need to know what comes next, the end may be its own kind of torture. But if you don't know what will happen, anything can happen. And that's beautiful in its own way.The Starless Sea is not a book for everyone. It breaks my heart to say it, but you might not love this book. But I did. And you'll never know until you try it.

3229272204	This book is a gift from Erin Morgenstern to us readers and lovers of stories.The Starless Sea feels like a fragmented half-forgotten dream that already makes no sense when glued back together, yet you still cherish it because it was the first luscious dream you had in months of stale dreamless nights. And yes, I may not make any sense. Someone give me a vial of citrusy oil from Madame Love Rawlins because I need mental clarity right now. "A boy at the beginning of a story has no way of knowing that the story has begun." Reading this book is like getting transported into a whimsical realm filled with libraries, books, teas, cats and all the reader glory there is – where things are so intricate and magical that you start questioning your own imagination's ability to keep up. I believe this needs a multiple reread to fully grasp the details, not leaving a single one out.It took me weeks to finish this book, as I savoured every line and word. Erin Morgenstern's writing is just so poetic and metaphorical, and the stories within the story never fail to give you chills, either because they speak so right to you or because it was just so hauntingly beautiful. One mistake I made while reading this book is trying so hard to put pieces together and apply the stories literally to the characters. It only tangled me further in my seams of guesses because this book is not plot nor character-driven, so there's no point in making connections. It's like an exploration game where you walk around, read for clues and take in the experience until you find out the real essence of the game. As for this book, its essence varies for all of us. It varies because we all have different ways to interpret each stories from Sweet Sorrows, Fortunes and Fables and The Ballad of Simon and Eleanor based on our own perspective of time and fate and love. Just like what Mirabel said, "A book is an interpretation."
3053442396	15/10/2021 Book 37/52“Everyone wants the stars. Everyone wishes to grasp that which exists out of reach. To hold the extraordinary in their hands and keep the remarkable in their pockets.”Still adore this, it deserves all the hype it got and more. I have listened to some of my favorite parts on and off since it came out, yet this has only been the second time I have read it again all the way through. Now to go back to relistening to my favorite parts, because the audiobook narrator's voice is the best thing I have heard in my life. 06/12/2019 BRB rereading this right now “Not all stories speak to all listeners, but all listeners can find a story that does, somewhere, sometime. In one form or another.” This was everything I hoped for and more. I'm not even going to try to explain what this is about, because there is so much in here that it would be impossible. All the hints to real books, all the interwoven stories, all the amazing characters. This book exceeded expectations. Maybe I'll try to get my thoughts in line when I've reread this This just moved to my number one spot of favorite books, right next to The Night Circus.
7852626342	Okay, but when do I get to find a magical painted door in an alley that takes me to a massive library with infinite books that explain how fast the universe moves and how important those stories actually are, and somehow, everything just makes sense?Reading The Starless Sea felt like falling down a rabbit hole—confusing, magical, weird, and wonderful. It took me longer than expected, but it was an adventure; it's been a long time since I felt so absorbed in a book. It opened a door in my brain to more complex and mesmerizing books. I'm obsessed.Erin Morgenstern, you just gained a lifelong fan. Seriously, how do you come up with this stuff?? The plot is like a puzzle you slowly piece together, and it's so beautiful. It's whimsical, mysterious, romantic, immersive, a little dense at times, but incredibly rewarding.Time travel, secret societies, magical doors, fairy tales within fairy tales. Honestly, whether you're into fantasy or not, everyone should read it at least once.
3067654586	I just didn’t get it, I’m so sorry 😭
2589504908	I think the best way to describe this is a magical, whimsical story that’s also confusing and timey-wimey. Honestly, I finished this a week ago and I’m still not entirely sure what I’ve just read. At its core, I feel this is a story about storytelling. The writing is beautiful, jumping from our protagonist Zachary to other stories told initially within the book Zachary finds, widening out into an expansive arc that feels almost as if it’s rebuilding these stories to fit the narrative. There’s the idea that there’s power in words, myths and lore that people create and construct and the stories build on the reader’s beliefs and imagination. It’s easily a story that would benefit a reread. That said, sometimes I found the stories did start to skim that line between gorgeously lyrical and over the top. Some of them feel unnecessary, and significantly slow the plot. It also made me confused on many occasions due to the constant jumping around. My frustration peaked a number of times, and I found I could only read this in small portions at a time because of this. I also really liked the concept that Morgenstern brings in surrounding star crossed lovers. It takes the trope and builds on it, making it bigger and amplifying it through her characters. Doing this sets more of a purpose to the characters. I liked Zachary well enough, although the secondary characters are the real stars of the story. Maribel in particular, with her pink hair and mysterious past, brought a lot of the story to life. Her story arc is perhaps the most satisfying too, as I found Zachary’s love story a little stilted and not entirely believable. It feels like more of an afterthought compared to the other great love stories that are written about in the book. The ending also feels rushed, and rather open ended with many of my questions left unanswered. Also, I loved the cats. And the bees. This isn’t going to be for everyone. It’s weird, nonsensical but also beautifully written and marvellously unique. If you don’t mind suspending your disbelief and flowery writing in your fantasies - give this a go. Also, if anyone can explain to me (view spoiler)[just who IS the owl king?! (hide spoiler)] that would be great.

4493660597	“Strange, isn’t it? To love a book. When the words on the pages become so precious that they feel like part of your own history because... they are. The beauty of "The Starless Sea" is so scarce, so bewilding, so enchanting that it crosses the horizon of being worldy and soon becomes something more, something so very magical that it hurts to read the book but you still don't want to stop... "No story ever truly ends as long as it is told." It's impossible to describe what The Starless Sea is about; it would be a endless list. "The Starless Sea" is basically the paradise of stories. Starless sea is where stories are alive. It is where your dreams come true...Erin combines, alternates and weaves a montage of folktales together with the story of our main character, Zachary. Stories fold into other stories and wander into snippets of lost myths and forgotten tales.“I know why you are here,” the man says as though he can hear Zachary’s thoughts.“You do?”“You are here because you wish to sail the Starless Sea and breathe the haunted air.”Erin is undoubtedly the queen of violet prose. I love good writing and flowery prose. The prose is so lyrical that the words would be immediately absorbed by your brain and for a fleeting moment you may feel as though something just stabbed you in the heart. There’s a surreal, dreamscape quality to the prose. It lured me in immediately after starting the book. Yes, it took me too long to finish this book because I got distracted. Otherwise I would have enjoyed it a lot more. So I would suggest to start The Starless Sea in your leisure, when you actually have time to invest on this magical book.If I have to describe "The Starless Sea" in a word, I would probably call it - Enchanting. It's beautiful and sweeping, mysterious and engrossing. For the fairy tales lovers, this book will prove to be a masterpiece. I personally ain't a fan of fairy tales or short stories. Yet I immensely enjoyed this book. I would highly recommend you to listen to the audiobook of it. It's better if you listen to these stories instead of reading them...My only complain with "The Starless Sea" is it's too vague for my taste. The countless stories inside it, the gigantic cast of characters do not connect together until the very end. For the better part of the book, you'll feel that you're reading several books at the same time. All of it, the vagueness, the obliquity, made it very difficult for me to read this book. One thing is for sure, if you're to get the most out of this book, you have to remember lots of details. And I suck at it. So, the twisty nature if the book did nothing but dampen my level of enjoyment. I still really really liked it overall. Poeple may say that "The Starless Sea" is pointless, it doesn't serve any purposes. I do agree with them. But being pointless and disoriented doesn't make it less beautiful. Not all the beautiful serves meaningful purposes. Absolutely pleasure, sweet happiness is all it offers...And for me, that's more than enough...
3030943309	My bookgods, but this was a thing of beauty!Meet Zach(ary), son of a fortuneteller, a bookworm and gamer, who once upon a time didn‘t dare go through a door that had appeared for him. Yep, a door like the ones we know from Narnia, Wonderland and many other places.Now, he is sucked into a story within a story within yet another story surrounding the Starless Sea, far below Earth’s surface, connected by doors and Fate and Time, inhabited and protected by Guardians and Keepers and travelers and many others. Basically, any story you can imagine is alive in this universe.Zach travels there via … wait for it … a book! :DThe book features symbols on its cover that are paramount in the world he is about to travel to/through: a bee, a key and a sword.Soon, he will meet other people, some nice and others not, all dangerous in their own sort of way. And while he tries to navigate the labyrinth of stories via self-aware kitchens, smart elevators and creepy crypts, accompanied sometimes by a cat and sometimes by an owl, trying to understand what is happening in order to save this wonderful world (hint: the solution is reading!), he learns about love and loss and the power of tales.I hadn‘t read any of Erin Morgenstern‘s books yet so I didn‘t know what to expect regarding her writing style. I‘m VERY pleased to report that there is a whimsical, flowery flow to her text that is never overblown or pretentious, but simply utterly beautiful and fantastic.Moreover, the characters the author created were colourful and varied and I found myself VERY involved in their lives, gasping and clutching a pillow to my chest, crying with them or yelling at them or wanting to kill them. And I enjoyed every second of putting the pieces together.One thing that is evident from basically the first page is just how much of a bibliophile the author herself is. It is palpable but also clearly visible throughout the book. Moreover, she seems to be in love with all manner of myths and tales and managed to weave them into a fast-paced quest full of magic and other marvels and one of the best literary worlds I‘ve been privileged enough to explore so far.I‘m so glad I was able to and decided to get a special edition of this book that will now adorn my library.
2951858572	It has been so long since I read a book. An entire book.My father died unexpectedly six months ago, and I've struggled to read since then.I went to ALA 2019 in hopes of rekindling my love of reading and blogging... I went with one big goal, and that was to obtain this book.It's the first of my ALA haul that I readI loved it. Captivating, intricate, a maze of interwoven stories. Exactly my kind of book. Exactly what I needed to start getting back into reading. I loved this book so much.***Review to come*** (I really hope so.)
