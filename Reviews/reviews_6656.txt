40533983	"You can recognize a small truth because its opposite is a falsehood. The opposite of a great truth is another truth." - Niels BohrI was thinking about Dante the other day and wondering how one could approach him from the angle of a GoodReads review. One of the obvious problems is that he lived a long time ago, and many of the cultural referents have changed. You're constantly having to think "Well, nowadays what he's saying would correspond to THAT". It isn't so bad in Hell, when there is plenty of entertainment to be had in seeing how the different sins are punished, and indulging your schadenfreude. Then Purgatory tells a moral story that's more or less timeless if you go for that sort of thing, but once you arrive in Paradise it starts getting seriously tricky. A lot of the stuff at first sight just seems irrelevant to the 21st century world... all these explanations about the mechanics of Ptolomaic astronomy, and Dante querying the inhabitants of Heaven on obscure theological points. It's notorious that readers most often give up somewhere in the third book. I started wondering if there was any modern-day author one could identify with Dante, and if that might help us connect to his concerns. And in fact, I do have a suggestion that some people will no doubt condemn out of hand as completely heretical: Richard Dawkins. Now of course, I am aware that Dante was deeply immersed in the Christian world-view, and Dawkins is famous for being the world's most outspoken atheist. But it's not quite as crazy as it first may seem. Dante was a Christian to the core of his being, but he was furious with the way the Church was being run; he put several of its leaders, notably Pope Boniface VIII, in Hell. On the other side, I challenge anyone to read "The Ancestor's Tale" to the end, and not, at least for a moment, entertain the idea that Dawkins is in actual fact a deeply religious man. He admits as much himself: as he puts it, it's often not so much that he disagrees with conventionally religious people, more that "they are saying it wrong". Amen to that.As noted, both Dante and Dawkins are extremely unhappy with the way mainstream religion is being organized. The other characteristic that unites them for me is this passionate love for science. One has to remember that, for Dante, Ptolomaic astronomy was state of the art stuff, and the details of the angelic hierarchy were a topic of vital importance; of course he cross-examines the hosts of the blessed to find out more. These days, I imagine he would be trying to get inside information on what happened during the Big Bang before spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred, whether or not the Higgs particle really exists, and how evolution produced human intelligence. For Dante, there didn't seem to be any opposition between religious faith and science - they were part of the same thing. I do wonder what he would have thought if he had been able to learn that many leading religious figures, even in the early 21st century, reject a large part of science as being somehow unreligious. It's wrong to spend your life dispassionately trying to understand God's Universe? I can see him getting quite angry about this, and deciding to rearrange the seating a little down in Hell.I keep thinking that there's a book someone ought to write called "Five Atheists You'll Meet in Heaven". Please let me know when it comes out; I'll buy a copy at once.**************************************PS I couldn't help wondering what Paradise might have looked like if Dante had been writing today. Obviously we wouldn't have the old geocentric model of the Universe - it would be bang up to date. I think there is now far more material for an ambitious poet to work with than there was in the 14th century. For example, when we get to the Heaven of the Galaxy, I imagine him using this wonderful fact that all the heavy elements are made in supernova explosions. "We are all stardust", as some people like to put it. Then when we get to the Heaven of the Cosmos, we find that the light from the "Let there be light" moment at the beginning of Creation is still around - it's just cooled to 2.7 degrees K, and appears as the cosmic background radiation. But it's not completely uniform, as the quantum fluctuations left over from the period when the Universe was the size of an atomic nucleus are the beginnings of the galaxies created on the second day. Finally, we reach the Heaven of the Multiverse, and find that we are just one of many different universes. It was necessary to create all of them, so that random processes could make sure that a very small number would end up being able to support life. How impious to assume that God would only be able to create one Universe, and have to tweak all the constants Himself!
2403216443	I We attempt to rewrite the Divine ComedyCanto IIn the middle of the journey of my lifeI came across a man named TrumpWho seemed bent on causing much strifeO! how he was an unpleasant, fleshy lump!Like some hobgoblin of the child's imaginationOr a thing that in the night goes bump.But in spite of lengthy cogitationI find I have produced fewer words Than members of the crowd at an inaugurationI've doubtless disappointed the Dante nerdsAnd before long may well concede defeatMy plan, I admit, was strictly for the birdsAlas! Success will not these efforts greetI am totally running out of steamAnd will soon be mocked by some misspelled tweetI had despaired. Then last night, in a dreamI heard a voice say, "Manny, just have some fun.Go on, I tell you, it'll be a scream.""Master," I said, "I think I'm not the one.""Fear not," he answered. "All things will be well.Recount the tale of Trump and Kim Jong-Un.""But first," I asked, "What is the place in HellReserved, I hear, for Justin Trudeau's soulAnd what his punishment? I beg, please tell."I said I would continue when I had found new inspiration. I considered changing my muse and interviewed several applicants, but Nandakishore's celestial connections turned out to be better than mine:Canto IIBut verily, the Americans did dumpThis gargantuan mistake of evolutionThis travesty of humanity called TrumpDown the drain; so, though not a final solutionIt does prove that your MusesAre not entirely mistakenIn clamming up; the mind refusesTo accept the fact that the presidency was takenBy a man whose only claim to fame isBankrupting every business he has ever lead;In fact, one can say that the "Trump" name isEnough to ensure that the enterprise, as a business, is dead.And then Théodore also found divine inspiration:Canto IIIThus my muse is so capricious,She only visits me when I'm not home.I know, it sounds so superstitiousBut I have this damn syndrome.There are so Manny reasons to take my lifeBut wouldn't be a sin, being so handsome ?Oh joy! My original muse, who apparently had been off on an extended trip to the Empyrean, returned with new verses:Canto IVHunky or not, to leave this vale of strifeAnd make my dwelling in the wood of suicidesMaybe next to Ted Hughes's ex-wife?The sweet poetry that she to me confidesWith these images my heart is rivenBut my good sense the thought deridesThat Sylvia will fall for me is not a givenParticularly since she'll be arboreal and deadThat's just some crap I read in Larry Niven
1286523302	Aclaro algo: no soy religioso, ni intelectual ni estudioso de los dioses o lo que pasa antes o después de la vida y la muerte. Leí el libro y lo encontré muy bueno.Leí la obra en un solo libro, pero no sabía que estaba dividido en 3 partes. Al parecer, Infierno es la obra más conocida, y no es para menos, pero vale la pena leer todo.Mi cabeza voló y voló con tanta información e imaginación en mi cabeza, el camino en el purgatorio, una vez estando en este, etc. Un viaje maravilloso y un libro muy denso para leer.No me sorprende la importancia que tenga Dante ahora después de haber escrito tamaña obra.¿Recomendable? Hay que ser abierto de mente para leerlo, no hay que ser ni fanático religioso ni fanático ateo. Un poco de mente amplia y objetiva, y les aseguro que disfrutarán muchísimo esta lectura. Son de esas que hacen bien para el ejercicio de la mente.
2867653897	”THROUGH ME THE WAY INTO THE SUFFERING CITY,THROUGH ME THE WAY TO THE ETERNAL PAIN,THROUGH ME THE WAY THAT RUNS AMONG THE LOST.JUSTICE URGED ON MY HIGH ARTIFICER;MY MAKER WAS DIVINE AUTHORITY,THE HIGHEST WISDOM, AND THE PRIMAL LOVE.BEFORE ME NOTHING BUT ETERNAL THINGSWERE MADE, AND I ENDURE ETERNALLY.ABANDON EVERY HOPE, WHO ENTER HERE.” Botticelli’s vision of Satan. There are 92 illustrations by Botticelli, inspired by The Divine Comedy, of which this edition contains a selection.I read Inferno while in college and had always intended to go back and read Purgatorio and Paradiso, but somehow the years passed and I never returned to Dante’s masterpiece. When my son went off to college and asked to borrow some classics to read, I sent him, along with my copy of The Divine Comedy, Canterbury Tales, Utopia, Paradise Lost, and several other important works of literature. The rule with books, of course, is that there is no such thing as lending and returning. The lending part goes fine, but the returning is usually the tricky part. When I decided it was time to return to Dante, I didn’t ask for my copy back from my son, though he would be one of the few people who would return a book. I feel that giving a book to either of my children is an investment in all of our futures.Since I decided to descend into hell with Dante, I was frequently glad to have Virgil as our guide. He explained the explainable. He provided a protective wing from the many monstrosities that we encounter. ”Gross hailstones, water gray with filth, and snowCome streaking down across the shadowed air;The earth, as it receives that shower, stinks.Over the souls of those submerged beneath That mess, is an outlandish, vicious beast,His three throats barking, doglike: Cerberus.His eyes are bloodred; greasy, black, his beard;His belly bugles, and his hands are claws;His talons tear and flay and rend the shades.” As I was reading Dante’s descriptions of various horrendous beasts, it reminded me of the fantastical medieval expressions of imagination that I’ve encountered numerous times in the margins of holy books. These early monk illustrators displayed such a vivid creativity in how they depicted their fears. I can only wonder how terrifying their nightmares were and for them to believe that these terrors were real would only add wings and claws to their trepidation. They were infected with these fears by Christianity, while being dangled the balm and possibility of heaven.How about this for a living nightmare?”As I kept my eyes fixed upon those sinners,A serpent with six feet springs out against One of the three, and clutches him completely.It gripped his belly with its middle feet,And with its forefeet grappled his two arms;And then it sank its teeth in both his cheeks;It stretched its rear feet out along his thighsAnd ran its tail along between the two,Then straightened it again behind his loins.No ivy ever gripped a tree so fastAs when that horrifying monster clasped And intertwined the other’s limbs with its.Then just as if their substance were warm wax,They stuck together and they mixed their colors,So neither seemed what he had been before.”After seeing some of the horrors awaiting us in hell, which has proved to be a much better scare tactic for considering improving my heavenly resume than Death on the Highway or Red Asphalt II were for improving my driving skills, we encountered the pantheon of classical writers Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan. Dante was so proud (we will deal with pride in Purgatory) that they accepted him as a member of their club. I was starting to wonder if Dante may have already resigning himself to a life in hell. Are great writers who don’t use their gifts glorifying God doomed to hell? One of the wonderful things about writing, to paraphrase Chaucer, is that you can eviscerate your enemies forever in print, and certainly the people who had most offended Dante in life were experiencing the tortures of everlasting hell. Writers do play God. Because of the fame of The Divine Comedy, their names will always be associated with a list of famous sinners. I would say that Dante’s revenge was served cold, but really it was rather warmly given. We also meet some sinners who led pious lives worthy of heaven, but because they were never baptised for the reason they lived before Christianity existed, or fell under the catchall phrase ”did not worship God in fitting ways,” and were all, every one of them, consigned to hell. God does seem to be very particular about all of his children fearing him, loving him above all else, and most importantly of all worshipping him. So it wasn’t about whether these people were good people, but that they showed proper reverence to his worshipness. Later, when I visited heaven, I didn’t see any issues with overcrowding, so I’m not sure why a few get out of hell free cards couldn’t have been surreptitiously handed out to those bereft of sin who didn’t completely conform to his will. How about even just a leg up to purgatory, where eventually one might after thousands of years of suffering earn a pair of wings? It was with some relief, my deodorant was starting to give way, we ascended to Purgatory and confronted the seven terraced mountain, representing the seven deadly sins. For those in need of a recap, there are the malicious uses of love, such as wrath, envy, and pride, and those where love is too strong, such as lust, gluttony, and greed. Sloth is the only sin not based on excesses, but on a lack of enough self-love or energy to be a contributing member of society. As I weigh myself on these scales, I can honestly say that sloth and greed have never been sins of mine. Pride, I will admit, was a struggle when I was younger, but life has a way of knocking the piss out of us and reminding us constantly that we are only half as smart as we think we are. I’ve had a few wrathful moments in my life, but being around human beings for too long will test the patience of the most sainted among us. Lust I will plead the fifth, and gluttony . . well, food has never been an issue, but one could make a case that I do suffer from a serious case of book gluttony. I did check out some of the real estate pricing while in Purgatory. *sigh* It was with some relief that we discovered some angels in purgatory, bedraggled ones to be sure, but still ones doing what we want angels to do, which is protect us from marauding beasts. ”I saw the company of noble spirits,silent and looking upward, pale and humble,as if in expectation; and I saw,emerging and descending from above,two angels bearing flaming swords, of whichthe blades were broken off, without their tips.”Angels are badass warriors, and there have been several television shows in recent years that has depicted them as soft and warm cuddle buddies, but really angels aren’t for clinking beers with, but for us to stand behind when winged, fire spitting beasts are attempting to turn us into crispy critters. Dante shared an epiphany with me while in Purgatory that left me thinking about the creation of dreams and how important it is for all of us to continue to build new dreams as we leap the final hurdles of achieving a dream or find that other dreams may no longer suit us. ”A new thought arose inside of me and, from that thought, still others--many and diverse--were born: I was so drawn from random thoughtto thought that, wandering in mind, I shutmy eyes, transforming thought on thought to dream.”Virgil was replaced as our guide by Beatrice as we were about three-quarters of the way through Purgatory. I was sorry to see Virgil go, but I must admit I’ve always wanted to meet Beatrice, just to see what type of woman would inspire such a lifetime of devotion from a man like Dante. She was the daughter of a banker, married a banker, and with her premature death at 25 remained forever the very vision of beauty. According to Dante, he only met her twice, but those sightings must have been magical because they left him with a permanent love hangover. I wanted to ask Dante if he had ever even talked to the lass or if he just projected all of his visions of her from glimpses of her outer beauty, but then the fact that she is here in Paradise may answer that question for me. ”In ascent, her eyes--All beauty’s living seals--gain force, and notesthat I had not yet turned to them in Mars,can then excuse me--just as I accusemyself , thus to excuse myself--and seethat I speak truly: here her holy beautyis not denied--ascent makes it more perfect.”Heaven light, as it turns out, is even better than bar light. We all look our best. If you are considering reading Dante, I would recommend for sure reading Inferno. Most likely when you encounter Dante references appearing in your reading, they will probably be from the Inferno. This Allen Mandelbaum translation is wonderful and so easy to read, and there are copious notes in the back to help guide you if Virgil loses you in a flaming forest. This is one of the classic works which I have felt for some time I’ve needed to read. There will be many more this year, including but not limited to War and Peace, Magic Mountain, and Les Miserables. If a bit of flayed skin flies out from between the pages once in a while, don’t be afraid; it’s just part of the adventure. A word of caution though, be sure to buy some SPF1000 before you take this scenic walk with Dante.

7201290972	"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate." "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." Dante Alighieri’s The Divine Comedy isn’t just a poem—it’s an eternal nightmare carved into literature. a journey through Hell’s horrors, Purgatory’s trials, and Heaven’s eternal glow. Sinners burn, the repentant climb, and the blessed shine—all under the weight of divine justice. Virgil guides, Beatrice saves, and Dante walks the path of every soul—lost, seeking, and finally found.This first part of The Divine Comedy is a journey through the nine circles of Hell, a twisted, poetic, and deeply personal exploration of sin, punishment, and divine justice. The first part of The Divine Comedy takes Dante (yes, the poet wrote himself as the main character—bold move) on a terrifying journey through the nine circles of Hell, with his personal guide, Virgil, leading the way.With the legendary Virgil as his guide, Dante descends deeper and deeper into a realm of fire, ice, and eternal despair, where sinners are tormented in grotesque yet eerily poetic ways. And yes—Dante literally put his real-life enemies in Hell, proving that petty is eternal. Dante’s The Divine Comedy is a journey of the soul—through fire, repentance, and divine glory. A tale of justice, faith, and love, this epic masterpiece is not just a story—it is a reckoning, a reflection, and a path from darkness to eternal light ~The Journey Begins📌-Inferno – The Descent into Darkness ”THROUGH ME THE WAY INTO THE SUFFERING CITY,THROUGH ME THE WAY TO THE ETERNAL PAIN,THROUGH ME THE WAY THAT RUNS AMONG THE LOST.JUSTICE URGED ON MY HIGH ARTIFICER;MY MAKER WAS DIVINE AUTHORITY,THE HIGHEST WISDOM, AND THE PRIMAL LOVE.BEFORE ME NOTHING BUT ETERNAL THINGSWERE MADE, AND I ENDURE ETERNALLY.ABANDON EVERY HOPE, WHO ENTER HERE.” *Lost in a dark forest (a metaphor for his spiritual crisis), Dante is confronted by three beasts:-A lion (Pride)-A leopard (Lust)-A she-wolf (Greed)Just as he’s about to lose all hope, Virgil appears and offers to lead him through Hell. From here, Dante begins his descent, and what follows is one of the most haunting literary journeys ever written. ~Themes of Inferno-The Nature of Sin – People create their own suffering.-Divine Justice – Sinners receive exactly what they deserve.-Moral Transformation – Dante starts with sympathy but gradually accepts God’s justice. ~The Nine Circles of Hell – Sin Meets Perfect Punishment -🔖-The Echoes of Limbo (Circle 1)"Noi non avem speranza, ma viviamo in disio.""We have no hope, yet we live in longing."Here, Dante walks among Socrates, Aristotle, Homer—brilliant minds barred from salvation simply because they were born before Christ. There is no fire, no screaming—just a silent grief that stretches forever.🔖-The Storm of the Lovers (Circle 2 – Lust)"Amor, ch’al cor gentil ratto s’apprende,prese costui de la bella personache mi fu tolta; e ‘l modo ancor m’offende.""Love, which quickly kindles in noble hearts,seized this one for the beauty of my body,which was taken from me in a manner still painful to me."Dante meets Francesca and Paolo, two lovers murdered for their affair, their souls now tossed forever in a violent storm, mirroring the uncontrollable winds of their passion.Yet, it is not their crime but their love that makes Dante weep:"Nessun maggior dolore / che ricordarsi del tempo felice nella miseria.""There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery."And in that moment, he faints, overwhelmed by their tragedy.🔖 Gluttony – Devoured by Eternal Hunger (Circle 3)"La pioggia etterna maladetta, fredda, greve,regola lor qualità nuova.""The eternal cursed rain, cold and heavy,changes them into something new."The gluttonous lie drowned in endless filth, as the three-headed Cerberus tears into them. They devoured life, now life devours them.🔖 Greed – The Weight of Gold (Circle 4)"Perché tieni? e perché burli?""Why do you hoard? Why do you squander?"Hoarders and spendthrifts roll enormous stones at each other in eternal struggle, a useless war of excess and waste. Their greed has made them unrecognizable, reduced to faceless shadows beneath their burdens.🔖 The Wrathful Drown in Their Own Rage (Circle 5 – River Styx)Here, the wrathful tear at each other’s flesh, while the slothful—who in life never took action—are submerged beneath the black water, trapped in eternal silence. Dante sees their fate and whispers:"Questi si percotean non pur con mano,ma con la testa e col petto e coi piedi.""They struck not only with hands,but also with their heads and chests and feet."A brutal, never-ending war with no winner, no resolution—just rage, feeding rage, feeding rage.🔖 Heretics Burn in Flaming Tombs (Circle 6 – The City of Dis)"Qui son li eresiarche / con lor seguaci, d’ogne setta, e molto più che non credi.""Here lie the heresiarchs and their followers,of every sect, far more than you would believe."Dante walks through a city of the damned, its walls glowing red with the flames of eternal suffering. Here, those who denied the soul’s immortality are buried in fire—because they believed the soul died with the body, their punishment makes that belief an unrelenting truth.🔖 The Forest of the Suicides (Circle 7 – Violence Against the Self)"Noi fummo già uomini, e or siam fatti sterpi.""We were once men, now we are mere sticks."Dante snaps a branch, and a voice wails in agony—for the suicides are now twisted trees, their bodies denied even the shape of humanity.One of them whispers in sorrow:"Io son colui che tenni ambo le chiavi del cor di Federico.""I am the one who held both keys to Frederick’s heart."Their only voice is pain, their only future silence, unless Dante carries their story forward.🔖 The Web of Deception (Circle 8 – Fraud)Here, hypocrisy, flattery, sorcery, and corruption take monstrous forms:False prophets walk backwards forever—because they sought to see the future, now they can never look forward again.Thieves are bitten by snakes, only to transform into them, losing their identities to deception.Hypocrites wear golden robes lined with lead, shining on the outside, crushing within.Dante watches and mutters:"E perché tu più volontier mi gratti,sappi ch’i’ son Bertran de Born.""And because you find pleasure in my torment,know that I am Bertran de Born."🔖 Betrayal – The Frozen Dead (Circle 9 – Treachery)"Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni.""The banners of the King of Hell advance."Finally, Dante reaches the ultimate sin: treachery. Here, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius are devoured in the mouths of Satan himself, who is trapped waist-deep in ice, his wings flapping but never flying, his tears frozen as he weeps for eternity.And as Dante climbs past Lucifer’s twisted body, he emerges on the other side of the world—for Hell is only half the journey. 📌~Purgatorio – The Path to RedemptionPurgatory is not eternal punishment, but a place where souls are purified before entering Heaven. Unlike Hell, where there is no hope, Purgatory is a place of spiritual progress.~Structure of Purgatory:Purgatory is a mountain divided into seven terraces, each representing a Deadly Sin:Pride – Souls carry heavy stones to learn humility.Envy – The envious have their eyes sewn shut to stop them from comparing themselves to others.Wrath – The wrathful must walk through thick smoke, symbolizing their past blindness caused by anger.Sloth – The lazy must run constantly to make up for lost time.Greed – The greedy lie face-down, reflecting their obsession with wealth.Gluttony – The gluttonous are starved in front of unreachable food.Lust – The lustful are purified by fire, cleansing their desires.💭Key Moments in Purgatorio: -Virgil’s Departure & Beatrice’s Arrival-Virgil (representing human reason) cannot enter Heaven, showing that faith is needed beyond logic.-Beatrice (symbol of divine love) takes over as Dante’s guide.- The Earthly Paradise (Eden) at the SummitThe final step before entering Heaven, symbolizing mankind’s original purity before sin.~Themes of Purgatorio:-Hope & Redemption – Unlike in Hell, these souls can reach Heaven.-The Role of Free Will – Sinners must actively work to cleanse themselves.-The Power of Divine Love – Beatrice’s presence highlights that love leads to salvation.📌Paradiso – The Vision of Divine LoveParadise is the most abstract and mystical section of the poem. Dante ascends through nine celestial spheres, encountering saints, angels, and divine wisdom, before reaching the Empyrean, the dwelling place of God.~The Nine Spheres of HeavenEach sphere reflects a virtue or aspect of divine order:The Moon – Souls who broke vows but were still virtuous.Mercury – The ambitious, who did good but sought personal glory.Venus – The lovers, purified by divine love.The Sun – Home of great theologians and scholars.Mars – Warriors of the faith, like Charlemagne and Cacciaguida.Jupiter – Rulers who upheld justice.Saturn – The contemplatives and monks.The Fixed Stars – The saints and the apostles.The Primum Mobile – The angels, closest to God.The Final Vision: The Beatific VisionAt the end of his journey, Dante experiences a transcendent vision of God as a radiant light that embodies divine love. Words fail him: "All'alta fantasia qui mancò possa;ma già volgeva il mio disio e il velle,sì come rota ch'igualmente è mossa."(Here my high imagination failed;but already my desire and will were movinglike a wheel that is equally turned.) "Nella sua volontade è nostra pace." (Canto III)"In His will is our peace." ~Themes of Paradiso-Divine Grace – No soul can reach Heaven by logic alone; grace is required.-The Ultimate Knowledge – Dante’s journey reflects humanity’s longing for truth and enlightenment.-Love as the Universe’s Driving Force – The final realization: "The love that moves the sun and the other stars."~Why It Stands Out-The Psychological Depth – Dante doesn’t just observe Hell; he reacts. He pities some souls, rages at others, and even faints from horror.-The Blend of Myth and Reality – Historical figures, mythological creatures, and personal enemies all find a place in Dante’s underworld.-The Language – The haunting beauty of Italian poetry makes the suffering feel almost sacred:-Dante and Virgil’s companionship is one of the best parts of The Divine Comedy. Their dynamic is like the ultimate mentor-student duo, with Virgil being the wise guide and Dante, the curious (sometimes terrified) traveler. Virgil is basically Dante’s emotional support poet, leading him through Hell’s horrors and Purgatory’s trials, always keeping him in check. And then comes Beatrice, bringing in a whole new level of divine guidance. ~Chilling Verses: 🔹 The Gates of Hell Inscription:"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate.""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."🔹 Francesca and Paolo’s Tragic Love (Circle 2, Lust):"Amor, ch'a nullo amato amar perdona.""Love, which pardons no one loved from loving in return."🔹 The Forest of Suicides (Circle 7):"Noi fummo già uomini, e or siam fatti sterpi.""We were once men, now we are mere sticks."🔹 Satan’s Final Image:"O quanto parve a me gran maraviglia / quand’io vidi tre facce alla sua testa!""Oh, how great my horror when I saw three faces upon his head!"📖 Themes That Hit Hard -Karma at Its Most Brutal – Each sinner’s punishment fits their crime with terrifying poetic justice.- Fear & Despair – The idea of eternal suffering is more disturbing than any horror novel.- Dante’s Personal Vendettas – The pettiness is real. He literally wrote his political enemies into Hell. 📜Final Thoughts — A Masterpiece of Darkness-Inferno warns us about sin and its consequences.-Purgatorio teaches the value of redemption and self-growth.-Paradiso offers the ultimate reward—divine love and enlightenment.Dante’s Inferno is breathtakingly dark, poetic, and disturbing. Each punishment is carved with merciless precision, and the imagery is so vivid that it still haunts literature 700 years later.Dante’s Hell warns, his Purgatory redeems, and his Paradise uplifts. He begins the journey lost, weighed down by sin, but ends in divine clarity, gazing upon the love that moves the universe itself. Is it an easy read? Nope. But if you love dark, immersive poetry with deep symbolism, it’s a must-read.⭐ Rating: 4/5 — A beautifully crafted, unsettling masterpiece.
5153246520	I started leafing through this at the bookshop round the corner, and by the time I'd got to the third page of the introduction I was intrigued. Clive James gave an insightful analysis of the Divine Comedy's poetic structure and explained, better than anyone I'd seen try this before, just how ridiculously difficult it is to produce an English-language translation that has some meaningful relationship to the original text. Everything is difficult, needless to say, but the very worst thing is the rhyme scheme. A prose translation is flat, and large parts of the second and third books turn into boring theology; in the original, they are sublimely beautiful, and the poem gets more and more beautiful as Dante draws closer to God. Also, Dante's poetry is propulsive, carrying the action forward at a rapid pace. But it turns out, unfortunately, that you can't do terza rima in English, the language just doesn't support that verse form. James thought about it for decades, and in the end had an idea: maybe quatrains would do the job? He experimented and decided the answer was yes. I flipped forward to Canto I and found these gorgeous lines:At the mid-point of my path through life, I foundMyself lost in a wood so dark, the wayAhead was blotted out. The keening soundI still make shows how hard it is to sayHow harsh and bitter that place felt to me -Merely to think of it renews the fear -So bad that death by only a degreeCould possibly be worse. As you shall hearIt led to good things too, eventually,But then and there I saw no sign of those,And can't say even now how I had comeTo be there, stunned and following my noseAway from the straight path.I was sold: James definitely had something. I paid my $20, took it home, and carried on reading.I had previously only read the tepid Dorothy Sayers translation, some of the Longfellow, and some passages in the original, but my Italian, alas, is still nowhere near good enough to get through the whole thing that way. This was an acceptable substitute, and James was not overselling himself. The language, indeed, was often beautiful. And it really was propulsive: I often read several canti at a stretch, unable to put it down. By the time I reached the third book, where Dante ascends the spheres of heaven in the company of Beatrice, a third aspect became noticeable: it was wonderfully romantic. The adoration Dante feels for his angelic Lady leaps off the page in a way that I totally didn't recall from Sayers. For example (one passage of very many):And so I am invited and made boldTo ask you of another truth less thanClear to me, lady. Let me now be toldIf ever it can happen that a manMay make it up to you by doing goodFor vows he has not kept." She looked at meWith eyes so full of love my powers couldDo nothing to withstand the clarityThat sparkled there within. My vision shook.I almost fainted, stunned by that one look.As I progressed, I become more and more certain that the translator was being inspired by his own muse, and I was also sure I could identify her: in the foreword, James was very gracious about the debt he owed to his wife, Prue Shaw, who introduced him to Dante when he was still a student and eventually become an internationally acclaimed Dante scholar. When James described how Dante is dazzled by the radiance of Beatrice's smile, I thought how he was being led on his own journey by his own celestial guide. It was really quite inspiring.I mentioned some of my theories to Not, who scornfully told me that, as any Australian knew, Prue Shaw had unceremoniously dumped her husband in 2012 when she found he'd been deceiving her for years with a much younger woman. Maybe James had had a heavenly muse, but it was less than clear who she was. It was quite conceivable that he in fact had had two muses.Damn. Why can't life ever be as beautiful and simple as you'd like it to be? But however it was produced, I still give an unhesitating thumbs up to James's translation. If you can't read five hundred pages of medieval Italian, this is the next best thing._________________[And the next day...]Over lunch, it occurred to me to wonder whether Leanne Edelsten was in fact Clive James's anti-muse, helping him express that sense of pervasive guilt so central to Dante. Not's explanation was simpler: she thought that James, like most male writers, was a total shit.I said that my interpretation in no way disagreed with hers, it was just more nuanced. But I am unsure whether Not found this convincing.
1350872603	الكوميديا المقدسة، إحدى أعظم نتاجات الأدب الإيطالي والأوروبي عامة، والتدشين الأكمل والأكثر تعقيداً وروعةً للمزيج الذي صبغ أوروبا في كل صحواتها من سبات التاريخ، منذ قسطنطين إلى عصر النهضة وحتى الراهن، مزيج الميثولوجيا اليونانية واللاهوت المسيحي.هذه الكوميديا موسوعة معارف وملحمة شعرية ولهيب رائع لوجدان نادر.قرأتها -على مراحل متباعدة- بترجمة السوري حنا عبود، لا عن قصد مسبق وإنما حصل لي الكتاب صدفةً، وهي ترجمة رشيقة ومنسابة بحكم انحياز حنا عبود -كما أعلن في المقدمة- للسرد والتصاعد الدرامي للكوميديا على حساب الشعري والمجاز الملحمي.وهي الترجمة الثانية -تاريخاً- بعد ترجمة المصري حسن عثمان، والعراقي كاظم جهاد، وثلاثتها ترجمات ثمينة، ولكلّ ميزتها، وإن كان الاحتفاء الأكبر حظيت به الأخيرة.وبين الجحيم والمطهر والفردوس، يجمع قراء الكوميديا ونقادها على أن الجحيم أجمل أجزائها وأكثفها بالدفق الوجداني واللهيب الشعري العالي.في قاع الجحيم يُرمى أعظم العصاة الخاطئين, وأشنعهم عذاباً في مملكة الألم الأبدية, وفي هذا القعر لا ترى اللهب وإنما بحيرة الزمهرير كما يصفه دانتي, هناك يرمى الخونة, لأنهم فقدوا في حياتهم العاطفة, تخلّوا عن الدفء, فكان عذابهم لا لهيب النار وإنما برد الزمهرير الذي يشبه أرواحهم. بين تلك الأجساد التي اقتحمت الشياطين أرواحها, مغرقة في الجليد حتى الأفئدة, بينما أبقي أعلاهم مشرعاً لليباب, بوجوه محنّطة بالصقيع, جُمّد فيها مسار الدمع من المآقي, حتى يبقى الألم هناك, في الجوف الذي لا قعر له,في الداخل المعتم المكتظّ بالألم والوحشة. يتضرّع أحدهم لدانتي أن يمسح خيط الجليد ليمكنه أن يتحرر وينعتق بالبكاء, ليستردّ روحه بالدموع, ولو محض ثانية قبل أن تردّه الإرادة العليا جليداً, ولكن دانتي يتركه ويمضي. كان أقسى عذاب في مملكة الألم ألا يستطيعوا البكاء, ألا يكون لهم دموع.في ضريح رمزيّ لشاعر إيطاليا الأعظم دانتي اليغييري , في مدينته فلورنسا, التي نفتْه في الخلافات السياسية التي اصطلت بها , و رفضت حكومتها -و كنيستها- أن يعود إليها إلّا بعد أن يكتب رسالة اعتذار و يمشي حافياً ذليلاً على مطلع من الناس كعلامة على الندم, رفض دانتي ذلك طبعاً حتى مات بعيداً عنها في المنفى في طريق سفر التهمته فيه الملاريا, قبل أن يكتشف الأوروبيون عبقريته بعد وفاته بعقود من خلال الكوميديا الإلهية, الأثر الأدبي الكلاسيكي الأعظم لأوروبا ما قبل النهضة. في هذا الضريح , تجد تمثالاً لفتاة تحني ظهرها و تبكي على القبر الرمزيّ للشاعر العظيم ...أبو اللغة الإيطالية كما سمّوه , هذه الفتاة هي فلورنسا ,في علامة على ندمها على ما صنعتْه لدانتي , و كأنّها تطلب الصفح منه . كثير من هذه المدن تحتاج فقط أن تعود -كما كانت- فتاةً ... و تبكي على أبنائها و عشاقها الكثيرين الذين ملؤوا المدافن و المنافي و العتمات.
695798003	I finished it! Someone, bring me my medal...the Inferno is Hieronymus Bosch with wordsA few caveats to this review: I am not a theologian, philosopher, medieval historian, Dante expert, nor astrologist. I am, however, a reader who wants to read "all of teh books" and I appreciate vivid imagery and interesting human interactions in fiction. I tackled the recent Clive James version of Dante's Divine Comedy--no footnotes or canto introductions here--because I just wanted to let the story wash over me, to see how much I could "get" on my own without knowing why Dante's father's baker's frenemy's ex-lover's dog-handler was sitting upside-down in the burning pitch in Hell. And when it comes to vivid imagery, the Inferno delivers. Surprisingly (to me), the Purgatorio was also fairly easy to follow, as Dante and Virgil continue up a ceaseless barren slope past the singing, self-flagellating sinners who do their time for various sins and, each time an angel wipes an ash-mark from their foreheads, become one level closer to heaven.From reading the inferno in high school I had recalled Dante as a sniveling, swooning sissy--but on this re-read found myself very much liking his sensitivity and sense of empathy, especially to many of the sinners in hell (well, as long as they are classical figures. If he knows them, he's more likely to go stomp on their heads). Guide Virgil has to chastise him numerous times to keep him from getting (understandably) emotionally mired in the horrors he witnesses. My favorite parts, besides perhaps the insult-throwing trident-wielding demons, were the back-and-forths between Dante and Virgil. Sadly, though, Virgil is barred from entering heaven, and in the third book Paradiso we are stuck with the so-nauseatingly-lovely-and-perfect-that-you-just-want-to-smack-her Beatrice. Regardless of this new guide, I found Dante's heaven as impenetrable as listening to someone describe an acid-trip. It struck me as a sort of renaissance-era Yellow Submarine (complete with its own Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds) though the incessant choral music wasn't quite as catchy.Lucy in the sky with DanteSeriously, I'm amazed at how similar this clip from Yellow Submarine is to the Paradiso! Watch it! *EDIT* Sorry, it looks like the Submarine link keeps breaking, so my apologies if it doesn't work. If I notice a problem, I will fix it! Should be working now, anyway.
3821220523	Îți trebuie un curaj nebun ca să propui o recenzie a Divinei comedii. Nu am acest tupeu. De aceea voi aminti că însuși poetul a oferit o cheie de lectură. Nu înainte de a preciza că titlul originar al poemului e Commedia. Adjectivul „divină” a fost adăugat mai tîrziu de unul dintre exegeți, poate de Boccaccio, care a scris și o Viață a lui Dante. Comentariul poetului se găsește în (probabil) apocrifa Scrisoare a XIII-a, către Can Grande, vicar imperial. În opinia autorului, Divina comedie prezintă într-o formă lirică trecerea sufletului de la o stare nefericită la una fericită, drumul de la infern la paradis, izbînda asupra răului. Itinerariul poetului (şi al cititorului său) se încheie cu bine. Cînd lucrurile sfîrșesc prost e vorba, firește, de o tragedie. Dar Dante a ales să compună o comedie.Într-o viziune grandioasă, personajul Dante vizitează infernul, purgatoriul şi paradisul. Şi, pentru a nu se rătăci, îl urmează prin tenebre, pînă în pragul paradisului, pe Vergiliu, autorul Bucolicelor şi al Eneidei. Rostul poetului latin este să-l îndrume pe călător prin nişte locuri rele, să-l protejeze, să-i arate ieşirea. Rostul poetului este, în chip analog, acela de a-l îndruma pe cititor să iasă cu bine din labirintul poemului. În acest chip, lectura însăşi devine o comedie divină, un exerciţiu hermeneutic reuşit, o izbîndă. Întreaga abilitate a autorului vizează tocmai împăcarea din final. Dar poetul nu se mulţumeşte cu atît. El îşi prezintă cu lux de amănunte procedeele retorice, îl invocă pe Cicero cu lucrarea sa De inventione rhetorica, face o trimitere precisă la Retorica lui Aristotel, cartea a III-a, îşi explică metaforele, analogiile, sugestiile, precizează sensurile suprapuse. Literal, este vorba de „starea sufletelor după moarte”. Alegoric însă, Divina comedie se referă la peripeţiile omului după cădere, la nechibzuita folosire a liberului arbitru, la pedeapsă şi răsplată, la opţiunea dintre bine şi rău, la soluţia oricărei dificultăţi prin iubire, care e opusul păcatului. Stilul terţinelor, face adaos poetul florentin în epistolă, este umil, întrucît a scris în vulgară, pe înţelesul celor mulţi. Ba chiar şi pe înțelesul gospodinelor, adaugă malițios.P. S. Scrisoarea a XIII-a este un rezumat şi o parafrază după o lucrare mai veche, Convivio: Banchetul.
1761727699	I must confess that so much was beyond my comprehension; but I think that is the mark of a great work of art...it allows you to take what you can from it from where you are. I can see why there are scholars who study this book for years; it is so complete, almost a universe itself. I was so happy when I finished this book - both exhilarated and humbled by the genius of Dante.
3207550352	YouTube kanalımda Dante'nin kitaplarından ve İlahi Komedya'nın nasıl okunması gerektiğinden bahsettim:https://youtu.be/qY11mC3P_e0"Yaşam yolumuzun ortasındakaranlık bir ormanda buldum kendimi,çünkü doğru yol gitmişti.Ah, içimdeki korkuyutazeleyen, balta girmemiş o sarp, güçlüormanı anlatabilmek ne zor!" (s. 35)https://i.ibb.co/kmFt6KP/1.jpgDerken bir ormanda buldum kendimi ben de Dante gibi. Yürüyordum. Belki de Dante'nin ilk kez 9 yaşındayken gördüğü Beatrice'e dediği gibi, ben de kimsenin kimse için yazmamış olduğu şeyleri Goodreads'e yazabilmek için yürüyordum.https://i.ibb.co/xHrxYkD/2.jpgO anda beklenmedik bir şey oldu. Karşıma Vergilius'un Aeneas kitabı çıkmıştı. Nasıl olduğunu anlamadım. Bu ormanda, sadece ölülerin bulunduğu bu diyarda bir kitabın ne işi olabilirdi?https://i.ibb.co/McVgQTn/3.jpgBana şöyle dedi Aeneas: Seni cehennem, araf ve cennetten önceki son durağa götüreceğim Oğuz, gel. Dünyevi zevklerden hiçbirinin anlamının artık kalmadığı bir yere götüreceğim. Senin de ölülerden değil esas dirilerden korktuğunu biliyorum, o yüzden bu yolda senin rehberin olacağım! İlahi Komedya'yı hakkıyla anlayabilmek için benim rehberliğime ihtiyacın var Oğuz...Vergilius bana bunları derken, ölüler diyarının kapısına geldiğimizde bu kapıda bekçilik yapan üç başlı köpek Kerberos'un yerine teknik yetersizliklerden dolayı üç başlı kedi olan Ketberos'un olduğunu gördük:https://i.ibb.co/JvxYJqF/4.jpgYolumuza devam ettik ve Vergilius beni rahmetli anneannemle dedemin mezarının başına götürdü. Dante ile Vergilius işte tam da bu noktada buluşmuştu. Ölülerin dilinden en iyi anlayan iki adamla birlikte bir mezarın başındayım, belki de hayatın en büyük ve en açık spoiler'ını yiyordum.https://i.ibb.co/g9QVVjr/5.jpgİlahi Komedya'ya ölülerin artık konuşamayacağını ve hiçbir ölüden haber alınamadığını söyledim. Bana inanmadı. Hatta o anda bana tam olarak şunları söyledi...İlahi Komedya: Yanılıyorsun Oğuz, eğer bir çeşit vecd hali ile kendinden geçip ruhunun dünyevi zevklerinden sen de kurtulursan ölüler diyarını sen de ziyaret edebilirsin. Ben öyle yapmadım mı kitabımda, okumadın mı beni? Cehennem, araf ve cennetteki insanların durumunu anlattım. İnsan, dünyada yaptığı ne varsa öldükten sonra da eksiksiz olarak karşılığını alır. Ne ekersen onu biçersin, bu böyledir.Oğuz: Peki, seni ve ölüler diyarını tam olarak anlayabilmek için hangi kitapları okumam gerekli İlahi Komedya?İlahi Komedya: https://i.ibb.co/qy1Fxzv/6.jpgİşte, bu fotoğraf sana yardımcı olacaktır. Dönüşümler 1-15, Aeneas ve şiir kitabım olan Yeni Hayat'ı okursan eminim ki İlahi Komedya'yı çok daha anlayarak okursun. Çünkü benim için hayat, Hristiyanlık'taki teslisler içindeki teslisler bütününden ibarettir. Baba, Oğul, Kutsal Ruh gibi sen de bu 3 kitabı okursan beni daha iyi anlarsın. Çünkü Beatrice ile de ilk olarak 9 yaşında karşılaşmıştım. Bu 9 sayısını da 3'ün karesi ile bağdaştırmıştım. Teslis ve Hz. İsa'nın bizi kurtuluşa götüreceği inancı benim için çok önemlidir Oğuz.O anda ölüler diyarından şöyle bir uzağa baktım...https://i.ibb.co/s1fh6Sj/7.jpgHerkes isterdi manzaralı mezarım olsun, sen benim manzarasız mezarımdın demişti Dante de Beatrice'e. Çünkü en derinine gömmüştü onu. Anneannemle dedem de belki şu an aynı yerdeydi, Dante ile Beatrice'in tam da şimdi olduğu gibi.https://i.ibb.co/nb1GshJ/8.jpgPeki, bizim gömüleceğimiz yer nerede? Anneanne? Dede? Siz söyleyin bana... Cehenneme mi yoksa cennete mi gideceğim?Anneannem: ...Dedem: ...Yahu Dante, sen kitabında o kadar kişinin cehenneme ya da cennete gideceğine karar vermişsin. Cevap versene bana... Biz nereye gideceğiz? Ölüler diyarından haber yok mu? Bildiklerin sadece İtalya tarihindeki kişiler ile mi kısıtlı? Sadece Caroberto, Cunizza, Lorenzo, Valerius, Mucius, Porsenna, Piccarda, Costanza, Donati, Forese, Corso, Francesco gibi insanların mı öldükten sonra nereye gideceğine karar verebiliyorsun? Nereye gideceğim, söylesene be adam?!https://i.ibb.co/dm0Qc2B/9.jpgKomedyanın anlamı, cehennem bölümünün ürkütücü olmasına karşılık bu şiirin, komedilerde olduğu gibi mutlu sonla sonuçlanmasından dolayı olduğunu ben de biliyorum. Peki bu inceleme neden bu kitap gibi mutlu bir sonla sonuçlanmıyor? Konuşsana ulan İlahi Komedya!https://i.ibb.co/LZQ1M4n/10.jpgO anda etrafta ne Vergilius, ne Dante, ne de Beatrice kalmıştı. Oğuz da o an ne olduğunu bilmiyordu. 11 İhlas, 1 Fatiha okumaya gelmişken karşısındaki kitap ona resmen meydan okuyordu. İlahi Komedya o anda çıldırmış bir şekilde üstüne geldi, Oğuz'un gözünün en son görebildiği açıdan sadece "İLAH" kelimesi okunabiliyordu...https://i.ibb.co/4fTY5Hn/11.jpgSonra da dünyası çeşitli renklere büründü. O anı anlatmaya kelimeleri yetmedi. Dante'nin de İlahi Komedya'nın sonundaki anı anlatmaya kelimeleri yetmemişti. Hristiyanlık'taki üç dinsel erdem olan sevgi, inanç ve umudun renkleri miydi bunlar? Cehennem, araf ve cennetin renklerinin mi bir temsiliydi yoksa?https://i.ibb.co/8Yzsj2v/12.jpgAnneanne, dede, lütfen söyleyin. Neden hiçbir ölüden haber gelmiyor? Dante'nin kafasına göre ölüleri cehenneme ve cennete yollaması bana çok garip geliyor, bari siz söyleyin. Siz şu an neredesiniz? Ruhunuzla beraber mi yatıyorsunuz burada? Ruh denen bir şey var mı, yoksa sadece bedenlerimizle mi dirileceğiz? Neden ölüler diyarından hiçbir ses gelmiyor? Hayatımın en büyük spoiler'ını yemeye geldim buraya. Biliyorum, ben de buz gibi bir toprağın içinde gözlerim kapalı bir şekilde yatacağım. Biliyorum, ben de İlahi Komedya'da anlatılan ruhların ektiği şeyleri biçeceğim. Biliyorum, benim de kendi iradem var ve dünyevi zevkler yerine esas kalıcı hayat uğruna çalışmam gerektiğini biliyorum... Peki, şu an neden böyle oldu? Lütfen cevap verin...Sen şimdi neredesin, ey Vergilius? Bana asıl şimdi cevap ver! Sana asıl şimdi ihtiyacım var rehberim ey Vergilius! Nerelerdesin ki? Ansızın yok oluverdin! Neredesin, ey cevap veren, neredesin, ey bana ölümü çok gören?"Cevap versenize!Niçin susuyorsunuz?

Not because of the story itself, but because of the language. The 30,000 references, and the fact that you need a dictionary, a Bible, book reviews, and a hell lot of YouTube videos if you’re looking to connect more with the book. Or I’m just pretty dumb.-Dante is the protagonist, and well, I guess I like him? It's not like he did anything else but to walk around (and repent???) but dude, you can mind your own business, too, you know that, king?-There are THOUSANDS of secondary characters. From Greek philosophers to saints, demons, popes, etc. You don't even know half of them, but they're there just chilling or being tortured till eternity. Just a casual Wednesday afternoon. -There's no romance as such, but the journey itself is undertaken by Dante's idealized love. -Stand-Alone. But it's 3 parts in 1, so you can just read the one about hell. -Stop sinning, guys. You don't want to be tortured like this... this is a reason to be scared. -Honestly, I found the whole part about paradise super confusing, and I didn't understand much of it.

"تقول دوروثي سايرز في مقدمة الجحيم: إن الطريقة المثلى لقراءة الكوميديا الإلهية هي أن يبدأ القارئ من أول بيت شعر فيها حتى آخر بيت، مأخوذا بقوة السرد وبالحركة الخاطفة للشعر، غير آبه بالتفسيرات التاريخية والشروح المنطقية التي لا تقع أصلا في قلب نص الكوميديا" (ص 9 من طبعة بنغوين 1977) مقدمة مليئة بالشروحات والتوضيحات، وحتى الأناشيد مترجمة بشكل رائع ومفهوم وواضح، وفي آخرها الكثير من التفاسير والهوامش، وكوني قارئة عادية دفعني الفضول الأدبي والمعرفي لقراءة هذا العمل، ولست متعمقة أو باحثة في هذا المجال، فإني لم أواجه صعوبة تذكر في قراءة الكوميديا، وكل الشكر والفضل في هذا للمترجم الأستاذ حنا عبود. "ما الوسائل التي يعتمد عليها قارئ الكوميديا؟... إن قارئ الكوميديا لا يحتاج إلى أي شيء سوى الدخول في القراءة مدخلا بريئا، لأن ما في الملاحظات والتعليقات التي تعقب كل نشيد من شروح تكفي القارئ إلى درجة كبيرة وتوفر له المتعة الأدبية والفنية." قد يقول قائل بأن دانتي استلهم أو سرق أو استوحى أو إلخ عمله هذا من رسالة الغفران لأبي العلاء المعري أو من الإسراء والمعراج أو من أي عمل أدبي آخر، وأنا أقول هنا، بأن كل ذلك لا يقلل من شأن كوميديا دانتي وخياله. اترك عنك عزيزي صاحب المقارنات تلك الاتهامات ومحاولات التبرئة وانطلق مع دانتي في رحلته الفريدة، وحرر عقلك ونفسك ورأيك من أي انطباعات وقيود مسبقة.

1029113311	La Divina Comedia es un libro asombroso. Bien es sabido que nos cuenta la historia de un viaje en un trasmundo fantástico: primero un descenso al abismo del Infierno, luego un ascenso por la montaña del Purgatorio, para terminar con la visión beatífica de los círculos concéntricos del Paraíso. He tratado de leer este libro al pie de la letra, sin preocuparme demasiado de los muchos significados alegóricos o de las innumerables interpretaciones que hay de ello.Estas tres regiones metafísicas se presentan como gigantescos paisajes o arquitecturas, por donde Dante y sus guías (primero Virgilio, luego Beatriz) descubren fascinantes galerías de retratos. Allí se mezclan visiones de la Antigüedad (Homero, Platón, Cesar, etc.), figuras del Cristianismo medieval (San Francisco de Asís, Santo Tomas de Aquino, San Buenaventura, etc.), así como los mismos coetáneos de Dante.El Infierno, donde Dante se encuentra al principio “por haberse apartado del camino recto”, se presenta primero como una serie de nueve fosas o círculos, cada vez mas profundos, donde se encuentran representados cada pecado: la incontinencia, la bestialidad, la malicia, la herejía… Primero se encuentra con grandes poetas, como Homero, que no pudo conocer a Cristo, y a personajes entrañables como Francisca. Pero según va bajando por los círculos de esas extrañas cuevas, Dante divisa a ejércitos que caminan al son de las trompetas que son los culos de los diablos, a reptiles que agarran a sus víctimas para incorporárselas, a huracanes sobre los ríos que recorren las profundidades del Infierno, a almas torturadas que van con los intestinos colgando (Mahoma). (Es muy probable que artistas como el Bosco se hayan inspirado de algunas de estas terribles imágenes.) Digo “almas”, sin embargo, ¡todas estas visiones son sumamente corpóreas! Finalmente, después de cruzarse con Ulises, se descubre la figura de Lucifer que, en una eterna pesadilla, se come a Judas, a Bruto y a Casio, los traidores de Cristo y de Cesar (vale subrayar que el acercamiento de estas dos figuras no deja de sorprenderme).Finalmente, salen “para volver a ver las estrellas” y emprenden la ascensión el monte del Purgatorio y cuando mas ascienden hacia las estrellas, mas ligeros caminan. Descubren esculturas que representan episodios históricos, como la caída de Troya. Discurren sobre temas de filosofía moral y política, como la necesidad del libre albedrío, la responsabilidad, el amor, la edad de oro de la humanidad, la decadencia de la Iglesia. Contemplan el árbol del Paraíso, despojado de sus hojas. Aquí finalmente, Virgilio abandona a Dante y lo deja en manos de la sublime Beatriz.Al entrar en el Paraíso, asevera Dante: “Ahora, lector, permanece tranquilo en tu asiento, meditando acerca de las cosas que aquí solamente se bosquejan, si quieres que te causen mayor deleite antes que tedio”. Esa apuesta es difícil de mantener, ya que Dante se mete en discursos teológicos de índole escolástico (sobre las virtudes teologales) con varios de sus interlocutores y trata, balbuceando y con suma dificultad, de traducir visiones que, se supone, son del orden de lo inefable. Sin embargo, algunas imágenes pastoriles, en las que se complace Dante en varias ocasiones, son de destacar. El viaje se acaba con la visión de la Rosa Celeste, las jerarquías angélicas y el centro infinitamente luminoso de la Trinidad divina, la luz pura y florecida de Empíreo.Acaba Dante rindiéndose con estas conmovedoras palabras: “ahora es preciso que mi poema desista de seguir cantando la belleza de mi Dama, como hace todo artista que llega al ultimo esfuerzo de su arte.” El esfuerzo también es del lector: aún tardaré algún tiempo en digerir semejante gira celestial…

47594830	I first read this poem four years ago as part of a dare. And by “dare,” I mean a professor listed it on the syllabus and I had to read it and then write papers about it. The next summer, I wanted to read it again on account of the graphic imagery of Inferno and Purgatorio. The punishments/reparations are mindblowing, scary, and beautiful. Everyone should at the very least skim Inferno. Particularly in Inferno, the political references are funny and provocative, and the historical significance of this epic poem is right up there with the Bible and Paradise Lost for me. Paradiso is far more abstract and sappy than the other books. I re-read all three last Fall because I’ve always felt attached to this work, and I figure you gotta read something at LEAST three times before you say its your favorite book. But yeah, this is my favorite book. It makes me want to learn Italian and read Dante’s Italian (and the whole part about him writing it in Italian instead of Latin pissed off so many people—again, the history of this piece is great). It makes me want to visit Italy. It makes me want to write something worth reading!

617038725	I am back reading another version of The Divine Comedy. This translation by Australian poet Clive James is the most lyrical that I have read. It is as if I was reading it for the first time and with all that joy of discovery.This review is based on the first book of this trilogy. "Had I the bitter, grating rhymes to fit This grim hole on which all the other rocks Bear down, I’d do a better job of it When pressing out my thought’s sap.But what blocks The flow is just that: my soft, childish tongue. It is with fear that I begin to speak,Because a language we employ when young To call our mother “mummy” is too weakTo use, even in sport, when touching on The lowest level of the universe...""And though my frozen face Felt nothing, like a callus, still somehow I felt the wind, and more than just a trace. “Master,” I said, “What causes this? I thought All heat down here was quenched.” And he to me: “Your eyes will soon be able to report Directly, for the cause you’ll plainly see That drives the blast.” And from his frozen crust One of the wretches cried: “O souls so cruel You roam free in the last pit of despair, Lift off my brittle veils and break the rule, That I might just a little give release To the sadness that swells my heart, before My tears freeze up again. So they will cease…"
1439563122	This is one of the best epic poems ever! I highly recommend everyone reads this, Homer's works, and Virgil's works. This was a great translation and a wonder forward and glossery.5 huge stars!Enjoy and Be Blessed.Diamond
3117083965	I wanted to read “Divine Comedy” for quite a while, but was not sure how to approach it. My main problem was that it is written in verses and I do not know Italian to read it in original. At the end, I’ve picked up a classic middle of the 20th century translation into Russian in tercinas verse as well. And, I think I’ve made a good choice. After a while, I got used to the pace and the music and the poetry had become palpable. But I only could imagine how amazing it is to read it in in original. Reading was not an easy work as I needed to flip to the notes at least a few times per page. But i got used to it and, at the end, the notes have started to act as as second meta- narrative. I would re-read all the notes related to a chapter before reading the chapter. It helped a lot to enjoy the verses and follow the story.It seems that modern readers often prefer “The Inferno”. I liked it as well. Especially, I enjoyed the architecture of it - downward spiral. And of course, the stories. Francesca and Paolo were the big highlight. I repeat after Borges’s that Dante seemed to be a bit envious of their attachment to each other, that they could be together for eternity if only in Inferno. While his intimacy with Beatrice was possible only through divine love. My modern sensibilities did not appreciate Dante’s treatment of the Prophet Muhammed, though I understand perfectly the historical context. He seems to be treated especially unfairly considering the hypothesis the Dante’s Paradiso is in many ways similar to the Isra and Mi'raj or night journey of Muhammad to heaven (According to Wiki and then initially raised in Miguel Asia Palacios. L’Eschatologle musulmane dans la Divine Comedie suiul de Histoire et critique d’une polemique. — Traduit de I’espagnol par B. Durant. — Arche Edidit,1992). But I guess, one could forget the man of his time.The amount of historical details and Dante’s knowledge is totally striking. I did not know much about Italy in the 14th century. And after reading it, I think i have a good impression how people thought at that time. The Inferno Journey was not scary for me. It was like the journey of discovery. And Virgil was a great guide.Moving on to Purgatory and Paradiso, I was not very much impressed by Beatrice as a guide, after Virgil. She seemed to be somewhat detached. And Dante’s dismay is palpable when she finally takes her place in Heaven (even if the feeling for her is replaced by the feeling of the divine love). But I absolutely admired the architecture of the both places he created. Specifically, I want to talk a bit about the role of mirrors and reflections. Now, for me Dante’s Paradiso will always be associated with the infinite reflections when everything is reflected and multiplied in the image of each other.Apparently, Dante mentions mirrors at least 30 times in the poem. The role of a mirror is to reflect light. He uses mirror as an allegory for the angels who do not need the language as they reflect God. He mentions it first in Chapter XV of Purgatory:Come quando da l’acqua o da lo specchiosalta lo raggio a l’opposita partesalendo su per lo modo parecchioa quel che scende, e tanto si dipartedal cader de la pietra in igual tratta,sì come mostraesperïenza e arte;così mi parve da luce rifrattaquivi dinanzi a me esser percosso;per che a fuggir la mia vista fu ratta.[13, XV: 16–24]He compares here the appearance of the angel to the reflection of the light from the mirror. And, in the process, he elegantly repeats the scientific law of light’s reflection. The power of God is compared by Beatrice to the power creating many mirrors, reflecting in all them, while keeping unity: Vedi l’eccelso omai e la larghezza de l’etterno valor, poscia che tanti speculi fatti s’ha in che si spezza,uno manendo in sé come davanti.In the final chapters of Paradiso, when he loses the ability to speak, he almost become a mirror himself focusing on reflecting the divine love. Although, Borges seemed to think that it indicates that Dante is simply asleep and dreaming of it all.And I finish with the quote from an article I’ve read in Russian (since than, I’ve lost it so I cannot site it properly at the moment):“We can suggest that the whole text of the poem was created like a huge “mirror” which reflected all intentions, all impressions learned by Dante-character in the process of his life and journey in the poem. All phenomena made by the Creator and multiplied by the love of the Poet are getting communicated to the past and future readers, like the light reflected in the universe of the Divine Comedy.”
2085124499	Dante? Awesome! I’ve always wanted Brent to review a game from the Devil May Cry series! Which one did you play?Er… well, let me explain. I wanted a space with my new website design to talk about video games—I love them. But I also want to, from time to time, engage with other media. “What I’m Playing?” fits in a shorter space than “What form of media is Brent playing or reading or watching, and what particular title currently, and what is his take on that?”So, uh, really this sidebar is “Brent’s Brain at Play” … so, yeah, it’s false advertising. Sorry.I’ve just re-read The Divine Comedy for the first time since four miserable weeks in 1995. Miserable not because I hated Dante. I read the Dorothy Sayers translation in terza rima, and I loved much of it. The misery came from the class: Freshman Honors English, semester 1. This was my introduction to college. One semester, one class: 4,200 pages of reading.I still believe this was the class that convinced the smartest student in the college—I’m talking ‘pun in Latin and expect others to laugh along with you’ smart—to drop out and become a priest. Little known fact: that kid punched me in the face once. (A little known fact that will doubtless come up when he’s up for canonization—he was a pretty darn good guy. Is still, I assume!) It was not the only fight I got into in college, oddly enough, though it was the only one where I didn’t hit back… So I guess you could say I… lost?But c’mon, you try to hit back after a future pope punches you. If the word ‘discombobulating’ had been invented for any legitimate purpose, it would have been for that moment. (But that’s a pure hypothetical. Don’t combobulate if you hope to copulate, nerds.)But I digress. Every student in Honors English 101 had a B or lower. (B- here.) Our professor was a poet. He really liked the word “wen”. No further explanation needed, right? The end of the semester was fast approaching. Panic set in for all these kids who’d never earned less than an A- in their 18 blesséd years, sir, by my troth!The professor said we could add AN ENTIRE LETTER GRADE to our grade if we… outlined the entire Divine Comedy. That’s… a trilogy of epic poems.It was an assignment that would later save my soul. But that’s another story.Imagine thirty sweating honors class freshmen, some of whom had scholarships riding on their GPA, others—far more importantly—had their entire self-worth riding on their GPA. All of us faced Thanksgiving Break with the shame of a B. It had just become Thanksgiving “Break”.There were three weeks from Thanksgiving until finals, when the assignment was due. Three weeks in the inferno—or, if one paced oneself correctly, one would only spend one week in Inferno, one in Purgatorio, and the last in Paradiso.Oh, let me tell you, how those freshmen rejoiced their way through Paradiso. Well, maybe the final canto. Paradiso’s a bit of a slog, dramatically.Want to see a textbook definition of subclinical triggering? Just whisper “Bernard of Clairvaux” to any veteran of Dr. Sundahl’s H ENG 101.*insert meme here*The angel on my right shoulder: *No, really, don’t.*All this is prologue. (Dizzam, bruh, that’s some Jordan-esque level prologue.)On to the review.I was glad to see that after 20 years, Dante hasn’t become dated. Ages well, Ol’ Danny Alighieri. Okay, fine. I should say, “more dated”. One thing in particular struck me repeatedly about Dante, reading him now as a 39-year-old fantasy writer, versus reading him as an 18-year-old college freshman, and I mean so oft-repeated I felt like my face belonged to a P.I. in a noir novel–I mean repeatedly like the bass thunder from the stereo in a 75hp Honda owned by that pepperoni-faced dude who thinks he’s auditioning for Fastest and Even More Furiousest Than Evar:The chutzpah. The sheer audacity. Dante was writing the work without which he would be forgotten by most everyone except Italian lit majors. He’s coming into this famous but soon to be forgotten, like the English Poet Laureate Robert Southey–you’ve heard of him, right? No. So before Dante’s written his Great Book, he presumes himself into the company of the all-time greats. (He deserves it, but he jumps into that place like that kid challenging Mario Andretti to a quick couple laps for pink slips.)But not only that. He, a Christian (if one who finds himself lost along the Way in the dark wood of middle age), readily consigns foes and even acquaintances—some not yet dead, if I remember correctly—to Hell. If there’s one thing the modern mainstream Christian doesn’t do, it’s to presume the eternal destination of others. As C.S. Lewis said, (paraphrasing) “When we get to Heaven, there will be surprises.” That lack of presumption is bolstered on our culture’s favorite partial Scripture “Judge not lest ye be judged” which goes on “For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.” Most Christians today are like, “Yeah, I’d prefer a really lenient measure, thanks. So I’ll just not presume to judge anyone else, either. Plus, not judging at all gets me thrown out of way fewer parties.” Dante, not so much. He’s like, “This pope from a few years back? Totally burning in Hell, right now. Look at the evil he did!”Dante does this while, as far as I can tell (as a non-medievalist, and no longer even a Roman Catholic) remaining himself orthodox. He doesn’t question the pope’s authority as it was understood then. Check this example out: that evil pope who himself is burning in hell? He’d corrupted one of his own courtiers, who had previously been some kind of shady guy, but repented, turning his back on all the evil he’d done earlier in his life. (Think like Godfather 3.) The kicker? Evil Popey makes him go back! (“I try to get out and the Pope (!) keeps pulling me back in!”) Evil Pope gets him to betray some folks, by promising our repentant Michael Corleone, “Hey, yeah what I’m asking you to do is evil, but I’ll forgive you for all this evil you do for me. I’m the Vicar of Christ, so I can totally give you an Evil Pass.” So the courtier does said evil stuff. And gets ‘pardoned’.Now the demons in hell that Dante encounters are super pissed, because “Hey, that guy should totally belong to us! He did evil stuff!”But Dante DOESN’T question that the evil pope effectively uses a loophole to get around God’s perfect justice. Nope. That courtier guy is heading for heaven—except the demons later tricked him into committing suicide by demons, a sin for which the pope apparently forgot to preemptively forgive him for.This whole episode is listed as proof that the pope was evil: he used his authority to pervert eternal justice. That’s really, really bad. Later Protestants would say, “This is redonkulus! No one gets to use a loophole to escape God! That’s the whole point of eternal justice: often on Earth justice isn’t served, but we can deal with that because we know no one can escape God’s justice. If your doctrine lets people fool God, your doctrine is wack, yo. [Also, that you have Evil Popes in the first place seems to point out a problem in your system.]”Dante’s audacity though, goes further than merely presuming himself in the company of the greatest of the greats, and also being comfortable judging the quick and the dead: Dante sets out to out-epic Homer and Virgil.Homer [with a battered old harp, ratty beard, and mismatched sandals–dude’s blind, give him a break on the fashion policing, people]: “Friends, Achaians, countrymen, lend me your ears. I’mma tell you about big war and a big voyage with the ideal Greek man.”Homer’s poetry and story-telling, his nuance and his imagery would capture and define an entire culture, and deeply influence many others through the present. It’s hard to overstate his impact.Virgil [strides forth in a solid gold toga, taking a bit of snuff from a slave]: “No offense, old sport, but your hero was bollocks, Homes. He was actually the bad chap, and not nearly as wonderful as you make him out to be. Let’s talk about that Trojan War thing, and I’ll subvert the Hades out of your narrative.”Oh snap.Virgil is a master of poetry and storytelling who is self-consciously telling the story of an entire people and their founding mythos, (small) warts and all (sorry ’bout that, Dido! a real James Bond always loves ’em and leaves ’em… burning!). Virgil meant his epic to be studied and admired by audiences high and low, and he meant to define his Romans as the best of the best. Sort of “the arc of history is long, but it bends toward Rome.”Dante [ambles up in a Led Zeppelin t-shirt and bell-bottoms]: “You guys are far out. Wish I could have heard your stuff, Home-bre, I’ve heard it’s real groovy, but the Saracens haven’t invaded yet with their hippie zeal to give us the LP bootleg translations of your work from the Greek. Sing it for me sometime. I’m sure I’ll dig it. Anyway, bros, thanks for inviting me to your drum circle here, but never start a land war in Asia unless you’re the Mongols, never get in a wit-fight to the death with a guy named Westley, and never, ever invite John Bonham to your drum circle. You guys thought small. Nah, it’s cool and everything, but really? Some guy on a boat? Some other pious guy on a different boat who lost a war to the first guy? I’mma let you finish swiftly here, but I’m going to tell the story of all creation, do world-building that includes the entire universe—both the physical and metaphysical worlds: earth, hell, purgatory, and heaven, AND show how my main man Jesus changed everything, aided in my quest by numerous holy Jesus groupie chicks and the spirit of Virgil himself. Hope you’re down with that, Virg. I mean, you’re an Italian, I’m an Italian, we’re pretty much bros, but I’m like your intellectual successor and stuff? Oh yeah, and because I’m after Christ, I really have an unfair advantage on you, because you were the bee’s knees. Seriously, love your stuff, I even own the b-sides of your pastoral poetry. So if I’m a little better than you, it’s purely happenstance: You came before Ludwig drums and Remo drumheads, man! If someone told you ‘More cowbell!’ you’lda been like ‘A cowbell? In music? What’s next, balancing a shield on a post and banging on it with a stick?!’ By the way, I use Paiste cymbals. I’ll show you later.”That story of all creation includes the pagans. Dante also sets about to reconcile, or at least appropriate, the gods and monsters of antiquity—though sometimes not very successfully. I’m like, Hey, big D, if some of the figures of Greek mythology are real, are all of them? If they’re real and they did some of the stuff we’ve heard they did, where was God in that? Are these all actually just demons just playin’ around? Fess up, c’mon. You can tell me, buddy, I understand. You just wanted monsters, didn’tcha? You got stuck on that one part and were like, How can I get Dante and Virgil out of this one? Oh, I know! A big ass dragon flies up out of the pit, scares the bejeepers out of them, and then totally lets them become the Dragonriders of Burn and head on down further!Oh, did I mention that while doing all this, Dante maintains that he’s writing on four levels at once: 1) The literal (which, you know, literally means the literal, the stuff that happens—hey, I write on that level too!). 2) The allegorical (that is, there’s what he calls “truth hidden beneath a beautiful fiction”) so being lost in a dark wood in your middle years might be an allegory for getting lost in your life, or even a mid-life crisis. 3) The moral (which explores the ethical implications of a work of fiction) so what do you think about Odysseus sitting on the beach crying to go home to his wife every day, and then banging goddesses every night? What do you learn about the power of hope or forgiveness when Luke Skywalker confronts Darth Vader? That’s the moral level; and 4) The anagogical. Yeah, you’re not going to see this word unless you’re talking about Dante, I’d guess. I had to look it up again. I was honestly proud of myself for merely remembering the word. The anagogical is a level of spiritual interpretation. This is when the work captures something that is eternally true. In a Platonic sense, it would be when you step out of the cave and instead of looking at shadows on the wall of thing that are True, you look at the things themselves. For Dante, this is of course expounding scripture in a way that captures “a part of the supernal things of eternal glory”. (Supernal: being of, or coming from, on high.)This is the level where you say, the characters Dante and his guide Virgil are hiking up Mt Purgatory, but Virgil is literally Virgil, a great poet who lived before Christ and thus is a pagan, so when Dante and Virgil get to the top of Mt Purgatory, Virgil can’t get into Heaven—you need Jesus for that. “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. None come to the Father except through me”. (Virgil’s not exactly being punished for being a pagan; he gets to hang out talking with all the other awesome pagans forever.) But Virgil is ALSO an embodiment of Reason, so when Virgil and Dante reach a rad curtain of fire up on the top of Mt Purgatory, Virgil can (as Reason) say, “Bro, you got this. You know there’s people on the other side. You know this is the only way to get there. You therefore know they jumped through this curtain. Ergo, you won’t get fried. Probably. Well, at least not everyone who jumps through gets a thermite sun-tan.”But Reason can’t go through that curtain himself. The thing that makes you jump through a curtain of fire isn’t, ultimately, reason. Reason can’t get you to Heaven. Thus, the anagogic lesson is that belief is, ultimately, an act of the will. Or, in the common phrase of which this scene may be the origin, one must take a Leap of Faith.Did I mention Dante’s doing this while writing poetry? And apparently his poetry is pretty good? (Not knowing Italian, I can’t say. The Sayers translation I read in college was way more beautiful than the Clive James version I listened to this time. Sorry, Clive, personal preference.)Now, I should probably address the world-building, too, seeing how world-building is something fantasy writers ought to know something about. (Yes, hecklers in the back, I hear you. Notice the caveat ‘ought to’? Now run along and play. With scissors.) In the mind of your inconsistently humble correspondent, Dante’s world-building is bold, presumptuous, brilliant, and a blithering mess.Whereas Dante’s treatment of pagan mythology would likely appeal to the common reader and just as likely outrage scholars who knew enough to ask questions, in his world-building, he seems to completely ignore the common readers, and go straight for the art- and map-geeks. You’ve probably seen those elaborate medieval drawings of the world Dante lays out.(I don’t even know if most of them are faithful to the text or even agree with each other, other than the order of the circles of hell and the like.) On the one hand, this world-building is ingenious. Stunning. (Anyone know if he borrowed most of this, or invented most of it? I know he was synthesizing a lot of speculation and Christian cosmology, but I don’t know how much of his work on this is original.)It all hangs together, literally and symbolically and morally. Satan is at the center of gravity? Like, literally? At first, you’re like, “Huh?”Well, he’s got to have his head visible in hell; he’s the king there, and he’s got to be scary. How scary is a guy with buried head-down with his butt in the air like a North Dakotan bike rack? (Sorry, old Montanan North Dakota joke there.) But when you think further, well, hell has inverted values, so after you come past him at the center of gravity, and into a vast crater–he left a giant crater when he was thrown out of heaven. Of course he did! And here he IS head down and not so scary, but he’s also head down because he’s buried in his sin. He’s at the bottom of a pit. Of course he is! He’s denied the light of heaven, his face must be buried. And so on.But most of the things that I caught on this second listening, I caught only because of the art I’d seen, and the explication of college professors and footnotes back when I’d read it before. Those professors taught me that the common way for people to experience a book during Dante’s time was most usually that someone would stand and read it to everyone else. (Audiobooks go WAY back.) This is a terrible way to experience what he’s doing, though.When you only listen to the Divine Comedy, there’s no way for you to understand a lot of the imagery. Not a real quote, but a realistic one: “Then I turned left 90 degrees, and saw, up at the point where the sun was crossing the mountain, another path veering to starboard under the sign of the Cygnus at the fourth hour of the morning” oh, and time moves differently in Purgatory. Or something. I still don’t get that part.This kind of world-building doesn’t work at all for the medium. Certainly the first listeners wouldn’t have any art or maps to help them figure this stuff out in real time, while the reciter continues reciting the poetry describing this weird journey. So it’s definitely weird, it’s opaque, and it’s kind of bad art–at least, bad world-building for what is, at core, more of a travelogue than an epic adventure.But it works… for the artists and the map-geeks, who fan art the hell out of it.Now, I call Dante’s world-building presumptuous because leaving the explanations for all the weirdness intelligible ONLY to those geeks ONLY works because Dante was famous. If he hadn’t been famous already, people would go, “Huh, this doesn’t make sense to me. So it probably doesn’t make sense. What garbage.”So it kind of works in the way Ikea instructions work–if you’ve got a bunch of Ikea engineers in your living room to help you out: “Oh, that was a concise way to explain that… now that you did it all for me.”Dan, my boy, that is some… what’s the term for accurate hubris? Oh, self-confidence. I guess it’s still that even when the SELF-CONFIDENCE IS GIANT, YO!All this! Look at all that! He’s doing all that… and more. At the SAME time! All that, and then… Dante flinches.Dante gets daunted.Bro!Bro.When this pilgrim who has had to fight past so many lesser demons (using his special access badge that says, I’m-on-a-holy-mission-one-of-the-roadies-from-JC-and-the-Sonshine-Band-says-it’s-cool) finally makes it to Satan’s circle and crosses the frozen lake of Coccytus, do you know what Satan says?Do you know how Satan addresses the first non-traitor to visit Satan since he was thrown out of Heaven? Satan himself… just doesn’t notice. Sure, the big guy is busy gnawing on Judas, Brutus, and Cassius but he’d been gnawing on those guys for thirteen hundred years!But nope. Satan says nothing. There’s no, “Yeah, I let you come all the way down here by my satanic will. It was all a trap. Now you can rot with the worst of them. I am literally going to eat your idiot face for eternity!”There’s no big rescue from the monstrously huge arms and hands as that giant is stuck in the frozen lake of Coccytus. No last minute rescue by an angel.Nope, Satan just doesn’t notice. Even when Dante grabs onto his hairy ass and climbs around him through the center of the universe where gravity reverses itself and climbs out to go to Mt Purgatory, literally past his butthole. Satan. Doesn’t. Notice. Doesn’t notice the man playing George of the Jungle on his hairy hip. And climbing…Past. His. Butt.Weaksauce, Ali D! Lotta buildup to go limp at the finish!

4170295021	Este magno poema concebido por Dante es no sólo el texto más importante de la literatura italiana sino uno de los más emblemáticos a nivel universal. Habiéndolo concluido me es fácil comprender porqué. Dividido en tres grandes partes: infierno, purgatorio y paraíso, cada uno integrado por 33 cantos más uno adicional que funciona como introducción, este poema es un despliegue de belleza y estilo, de compromiso con el equilibro y una inimitable proeza de espíritu creativo.La divina comedia nos sumerge en los círculos más hondos y retorcidos del infierno y nos propone, junto a Dante, su protagonista, y los aliados que este halla en el viaje, un ascenso fascinante, retorcido y lírico hacia lo más alto del paraíso. Ayudado en primera instancia por Virgilio y en las secciones más divinas por Beatriz, Dante recorre los destinos que aguardan a las almas mortales una vez concluido su paso por la tierra y el lugar que les corresponde de acuerdo a las vidas adoptadas y los pecados cometidos. El infierno es, con diferencia, el punto más corrupto, oscuro y formidablemente creativo de la comedia. Algo que me fascinó profundamente, además del estilo lírico y cuán amena me resultó la lectura, es la constante sucesión de grandes nombres que Dante despliega, desde importantes figuras políticas, pasando por grandes pensadores y enfrentándose a extraordinarios artistas, su viaje por los distintos estratos del infierno, purgatorio y paraíso no está plagado de espíritus anónimos sino que se topa una y otra vez con seres reales, famosos por su corrupción moral, su genio o su sacrificio. Este hecho enriquece en términos incalculables una lectura de por sí extraordinaria.Me rehúso a profundizar más porque no quiero condicionar al lector con excesiva información, además, difícilmente mis palabras podrían genuinamente capturar la grandeza de lo conquistado por el autor.
1039876904	4.5 stars This was my second attempt to read "The Divine Comedy". The first time, I did not care for the English translation of the book I had selected. I found Mandelbaum's translation in this book to be more readable. Another plus of reading this translation, is this book had wonderful Botticelli illustrations of Dante. I thought the illustrations really enhanced my reading experience as they helped me visualize several of the scenes in the book.This was not a book that I could read fast, although there were parts were I wanted to keep reading and not put it down. I really struggled with the beginning but then found my pace. This journey through hell, purgatory and heaven was quite enjoyable once I found my footing with it. I am definitely glad that I read it. It was not a fast read but once that endured and was well worth it.
169579533	I am so glad for the Divine Comedy and Decameron group for providing the structure and encouragement which provided the impetus for my finally reading this classic! I am also very pleased that I decided to read John Ciardi's translation as his synopsis and notes added immeasurably to my reading. While personally I found Dante's travel's through Hell occasionally difficult, the Purgatorio and Paradiso (except for the first few scholarly cantos) flowed with beautiful poetry. And through it all, Dante maintained his amazing, and consistent, vision.No wonder this has stood the test of time.
3302670648	I've re-read it one more time. I forget that the journey is not outside of us, but is within us. Dante is not talking about others who are in hell, or purgatory, or Paradise, since we are all exile (out-side of our islands). For each of us the pieces of ourselves are fragmented . Unlike most people, I prefer the Paradise section most of all, each step in paradise shows the different intelligibility that we need to find meaning in what seems to be a meaningless life. I read Dante for the first time three years ago, then again, a year ago, and then again, last week, and then I reread it this week. In addition, I watched the Yale course, Dante in Translation for the third time last week, while concurrently reading Virgil’s Aeneid, and read Dante’s de Monarachia, and recently I just finished reading the Old Testament and Maimonides’ Guide for the Perplex. Also, about a week ago I listened to the course by Sr. Mary Clement Davlin on the Divine Comedy (I want to note that her course was the best overall resource for me in order to understand The Comedy). There’s a reason why Dante’s worth all this trouble. Simply put, in order to understand the Medieval age and it’s beginning of the end and the start of Humanism one must understand The Comedy, and without understanding history one cannot understand who we are today. Of all the books ever written there is no stronger evidence for the likelihood that the author is a time traveler from the future than this book if one assumes that the time traveler is forced to explain only within the paradigms of his time period while subtly overturning the given worldview by explaining everything the current generation thought they knew about themselves within their own parameters while laying a foundation for a new way of understanding the world. Scholasticism is best demolished by a scholastic by using its own language. Dante summarizes Medieval history with his encyclopedic rendering of how the Medieval mind thought of itself as itself allowing for the beginning of the ending of the predomination of scholastic thought while setting the stage for what will soon come to pass while explaining the world in terms of the human rather than the divine by using the divine as a way to bring humans back into the world and thus becoming arguably the first Humanist. Dante doesn’t mention Maimonides or his Guide for the Perplex, but he does mention Avicenna and Averroes and embraces Aristotle as they both think in Aristotelian terms. Aquinas, who is prominently placed in Paradise, synthesizes Aristotle with Augustine and respects Avicenna so much he just refers to him as the commentator for his ability in explaining Aristotle. (I want to note that Plotinus is not in Dante at least I don’t think he was, but pseudo-Dionisius is, and Aquinas relies heavily on both. I just find that an interesting oversight by Dante. It might not be clear to you, but Augustine synthesizes Plotinus with Cicero giving us his Christianity and Augustine is a major character within Dante). Aquinas puts reason before faith, Bonaventure will put faith before reason. Each are in paradise as is St. Francis who will marry Lady Poverty so that love, that is the primo mobile, will shake the universe into existence since our will of our will gives us our freedom to choose beyond our nature and forces us to own ourselves and actualize our own authenticity. Those who make no choice are making a choice and will be outside of the Gates of Inferno and must remain in limbo forever and a day. All of wisdom (according to the Count of Monte Cristo) is contained in these two words: wait and hope. Hope is a verb of the future. It is always an expectation of something to come. The ontological difference between knowledge and faith is hope at least according to Dante. I would like to note that Pandora released all of the evils into the world except for one, namely hope. The Greeks were suspicious of hope and made hope a vice as they would make pride a virtue. Dante makes hope a virtue and pride a vice. Heidegger will shake the foundations of Philosophy in 1927 with his Being and Time and he makes care his foundation for human being, care is another verb of the future. The ultimate good is a contemplation of the divine and the consideration of justice while in Dante’s Paradise. We live in a world such that the thinking and the doing, the mind and the body, the action and the thought do not ever meet. Hegel will try to reconcile sense certainty with the truth outside of us and often would appeal to Dante in his expositions. Dante knows the problem with contingency and necessity while trying to preserve freewill in the face of human nature and our choices within an uncertain world. All of this is also within Dante and he’ll tell you through his musical rhetoric and will always tell you what he is trying to tell you but sometimes reveals the reasons slowly. It’s not important to know all the characters he introduces because he’ll tell you why they are in his story but sometimes he doesn’t let you know until the last line of the Canto or sometimes not even until the next Canto. By all means, read the Clive James translation first since he will integrate what others have said in footnotes seamlessly into his translation. All of Kant’s antinomies are laid out within Purgatory within the different Cantos. Hegel’s dialectic approach is too. All of philosophy until Kant and shortly after as modified by Hegel would say that ‘the truth is out there’, Dante is a partial exception to that rule about philosophers who came before Kant. He knows that Leah will act while Rachel must think and that the supreme good is an infinite that the finite will struggle with before fully grasping that certainty remains elusive. Yes, Dante is writing a poem (music with rhetoric) but he definitely lays a foundation for what will be coming, and, oh yeah, one really needs to read Vico’s New Science in order to see some of Dante’s influence, both realize that we exist in a Bayesian world because our memories evolve as our imagination overcomes the now. One of my favorite sentences from a recent book I read is ‘most Enlightenment thinkers were Pelagians’. You can bet that Dante was too. He makes a point that prayer makes a difference. Augustine would not; Pelagius would. Augustine would say God’s grace is freely given and that there are two separate magisterial that don’t intersect, the City of God and the City of Man; Pelagius would not. Dante does lay this out clumsily in his de Monarachia which makes what he is saying in The Comedy all the more understandable, though he doesn’t acknowledge Pelagius. Dante would even hint that those from the Ganges, who believe nature is God and God is nature (as he believed the Hindus did, and how Spinoza will later) and those who believe love is all you need as St. Francis of Assisi and St. Bonaventure did, or those who make God outside of the world and not knowable by mortals such as the Saracens are just as worthy as those who believe God came to earth as a man and was more than just an apparition as the heterodox belief of a Roman Emperor who saw the errors of his way. Yes, Dante will place the unbaptized infants and the pagans not in Paradise, but Dante similarly to Pelagius would like to reconsider their status if given a chance. The Venerable Bede is mentioned multiple times in The Comedy, but without a doubt, Bede’s Pelagius is nothing but a heterodoxic villain and Dante knows better than to acknowledge Pelagius as worthy of Paradise. There is appearance and a reality hidden which can be revealed by art, poetry, music, sculptures, puzzles and seeing with our eyes and hearing with our hearts which remains hidden as we look at everything while seeing nothing and distract ourselves with our idle chatter while we don’t allow ourselves to square the circle because the transcendental deduction (Kant concept) obscures reality. Virgil will scoff at Dante when he vicariously participates in the schadenfreude of watching others bicker while he was in Inferno.An exile, as Dante was, is not only outside of his own island (ex + ile=island), he is also alienated from themself. The key for me in understanding The Comedy was not to think it is a religious allegory, but more of an allegory about our own life. That clue came to me from Sr. Mary Devlin’s course which I referenced above. Aristotle made pride a virtue while Dante makes it foundational to all of the cardinal sins. The Comedy is not an easy read. It is a necessary read for understanding Medieval thought and for what will come later. Will Durant made Dante his pivotal character in the ‘Age of Faith’ Volume 4 of ‘Story of Civilization’ for a reason. To understand The Comedy is to understand the Medieval age and what will come after. Oddly, Gibbons’ made Petrarch his final and most important character within his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. I know Dante is a mystic. I know he definitely prefers the Franciscans over the Dominicans. He’ll make the most mystic of the mystics St. Bernard the final guide in his journey for a reason, but, even with all of that, I think it’s possible to read The Comedy as our individual journey in this life where we must reconcile the ontological difference with our own transcendental deduction and own our own authenticity. Dante doesn’t find himself in the middle of his personal journey, he finds himself in the middle of ‘our’ journey. The Comedy is not about others it is about ourselves. Every experience is relevant for the individual. Much of modern-day philosophy is hidden within this book from the first page onward to the last. From the get go, we are shrouded in greed, pride, and jealousy, and a little bit of ourselves is revealed along each step in the book and a whole lot of what is to be revealed latter by brilliant philosophers to come are also within these pages. I’ll end these ramblings by ‘walking away with a trumpet of the arse’ (otherwords: a fart!).
3712724373	“All hope abandon, ye who enter here.” excellent fanfiction.it's obviously an excellent poem BUT i guess i just did not enjoy it as much as u all did. last year we talked about this shit a lot in uni so i finally decided to read the whole thing.i did not really like Paradiso so there's that.Dante is such a name dropper.i'm too lazy to write a review *let's be honest, no one cares about my opinion on this* so look at these:
4273774536	Dante es un poeta astral, ya diré por qué. La comedia es el poema total (tomando prestada la idea a la novela). El viaje iniciático o viaje del héroe que hace Dante es un viaje hacia el conocimiento de la verdad, del conocimiento más puro, de la totalidad. Dante tiene la habilidad para hacer de un entramado ficcional no sólo un símbolo del viaje del poeta hacia el Párnaso o a la gloria, sino convertir la propia experiencia mística del autor encarnada en su alter ego que es su propio yo ficcionado, quien es conducido por los dos primeros tramos (Infierno y Purgatorio) por Virgilio, el más grande poeta latino según Dante, convertir, decía, esa propia experiencia ficcional en una intención no tan ficcional. El poeta devenido en profeta, que busca la gloria más alta, la corona de laureles, finalmente la alcanza en el conocimiento de la divinidad. ¿A qué Párnaso más alto se puede aspirar? Esto lo sabe bien Dante, y su venganza se convertirá en el poema mas grande de su tiempo (y de aun después) que es la primera gran autoficción de la literatura, pero también una vanguardia en cuanto a las cualidades modernas adelantadas a su tiempo que Dante exhibe en La Comedia. Que de comedia literalmente pasa a convertirse progresivamente en un poema sacro. Ahora, quiero hablar sobre el tema de si es un poema sacro o no. Bueno, lo es. Pero no es sólo eso, es muchas cosas más y esa es la genialidad de Dante. Hemos visto que Dante construye una arquitectura del inframundo y el más allá. Pero, si extrapolamos esta idea de arquitectura, construye también un arquitectura del conocimiento de la verdad, que en el cristianismo es el conocimiento de Dios. El viaje de Dante se estructura en escaleras de descenso y ascenso que simbolizan los estados de su alma al pasar por la purificación necesaria para alcanzar el conocimiento de Dios. Esto en sí es una alegoría de la iluminación espiritual. En el catolicismo, todos estamos llamados a ser santos y eso es un camino de perfección espiritual al que Dante le dota de materialidad. El autor materializa un viaje que es inmaterial, invisible. Visibiliza lo invisible. Narra lo inenarrable. Y volviendo a la idea del poema sacro, lo que hace es precisamente una construcción previa para llegar al poema sagrado. La Comedia es una escalera que lleva a lo sagrado. Si tenemos en el Infierno hasta vulgaridades, en el cielo la vara se eleva no solo en lenguaje y estilo sino en misticismo y doctrina católica. Entonces, el cielo es más difícil de leer porque Dante lo hizo a propósito, pues quería que el lector que accediera a esta parte fuera alguien con un nivel espiritual más elevado, y para ese tipo de lector el cielo le parecería lo más sublime del poema. Mientras que para Dante, el lector común se iba a identificar más con el Infierno y lo iba a disfrutar más, porque el hombre está más cercano al pecado que a la virtud. Para acercarse a la virtud hay que hacer un trabajo arduo y ese trabajo, según la doctrina, es la imitación de Cristo. Por eso todos estamos llamados a la santidad. Y Dante lo sabe. Entonces, en ese camino de construcción del poema termina convirtiéndose en sacro. Al igual que Dante termina purificandose y convirtiéndose en santo (no en santo de veneración declarado por la Iglesia sino en el santo que todos los católicos deberíamos aspirar a ser). Ahora bien, por supuesto que la universalidad de Dante hace que La Comedia no sea sólo eso, pues es también un poema político, social, coyuntural, y personal. Al leer Vida de Dante, de Boccaccio, he entendido algunas cosas de la intención y motivaciones de Dante para escribir la Comedia. Primero, su sueño era ser coronado con laureles en una plaza de Florencia (parece que era una tradición) y nunca lo logró por el exilio que sufrió. Su anhelo de fama y reconocimiento eran enormes, y su resentimiento por su situación aún más. Dante odiaba al final a ambas facciones que se disputaban el poder en su Florencia natal, güelfos y gibelinos, porque si bien los segundos eran sus enemigos políticos, al final quienes le expulsaron fueron los de una parte de su propia facción, los güelfos negros (él era de los blancos). Entonces, mientras escribe La Comedia realmente gesta odio dentro de sí y no puede desembarazarse de ello, por eso exorciza todo esto en el poema. La Comedia es más personal y visceral de lo que parecería. Pero aún así, la intención mística, emparentada o fusionada con su intención de inmortalidad y gloria, o sea, de alcanzar el Párnaso de los poetas, es más grande. Esa intención de llegar a lo más alto es una analogía del perfeccionamiento espiritual. Lo más alto de la gloria entonces, entiende Dante poéticamente, no es la gloria de los hombres sino la gloria de Dios. Y es así como un poema laico, secular y hasta profano (dependiendo desde dónde se lo vea), se convierte en un poema sagrado, que sería lo máximo a lo que puede aspirar un poeta. Elevar sus versos a la eternidad, al mismo Dios. Entonces en en esa intención de inmortalidad y gloria que busca el Dante poeta, es que llega a la búsqueda de la perfección mayor, poéticamente hablando, que sería la de conocer al mismo Dios. Son las enormes analogías que hace Dante: perfección poética/perfección espiritual/, gloria e inmortalidad poética/gloria e inmortalidad divinas (por ello habla del Juicio Final, ya que según la doctrina, los justos recobrarán su cuerpo físico, lo cual no es más que alcanzar la inmortalidad física y además la espiritual). La Comedia escrita durante su doloroso exilio, es un trasunto de sí mismo, de sus animadversiones y pasiones, pero también se trasciende a sí mismo para alcanzar un lugar histórico y místico que representan la humanidad y el Todo. Ahora, la parte del cielo es de lo que menos se habla pero realmente contiene los cantos más complejos poéticamente hablando, líricamente incluso, el uso del lenguaje y el verso se refinan, las alegorías y simbolismos se vuelven mas crípticos porque también teológicamente es mucho más exigente. Durante todo el trayecto son evidentes las influencias de Tomás de Aquino y el tomismo, de Aristóteles, de la escolástica, y hasta de averroísmo hay algo, aunque en cuanto a doctrina puede que no cumpla de forma fidedigna, ya que hay muchos aportes de su propio imaginario, es decir, en algunas partes podría ser no doctrinalmente correcto; aunque toda la arquitectura y cosmogonía creadas por Dante (la del cielo basada en la teoria del astrólogo/astrónomo Ptolomeo) han tenido resonancia en las propias creencias populares y le han dotado de una mitología propia a la idea de Infierno, Purgatorio y Cielo venidas del catolicismo. Ahora, aunque lo que más se asiente en el imaginario colectivo sean las imágenes del infierno que sí, son fenomenales, no obstante, las imágenes poéticas y alegóricas del cielo (o de los nueve cielos y el Empíreo), son fantásticas. ¡Estamos en el espacio sideral! Vamos pasando de planeta en planeta hasta llegar a una parte donde solo hay estrellas, en la que los beatos brillan más que ellas. Allí nos encontramos con algunos santos, entre ellos el que se lleva mayor protagonismo es Tomás de Aquino, por supuesto. Después veremos a los tres Apóstoles más cercanos a Cristo, Pedro, Santiago y Juan, al arcángel Gabriel y la corte celestial de serafines, querubines, tronos, dominaciones y potestades (todos girando en velocidades insospechadas al rededor de un punto brillante que es Dios), y a la Virgen María, entre los personajes que más protagonismo tienen en el poema.Si nos ponemos a pensar en todo lo que hizo Dante en esta obra podemos decir que es el Poema Total (tomando prestado el concepto de novela total), porque materializa el mundo espiritual de una forma nunca antes vista. Su recorrido nos lleva incluso a donde el hombre aún no había llegado (pero algún día llegará a través de la ciencia). Dante es un poeta espacial, astral, el astronauta de la poesía. Hasta en eso fue visionario. Logró ser un profeta a la final.He escrito muchas apreciaciones sobre toda esta obra (mientras comentaba con un club de lectura) pero me resulta imposible ponerlo todo en esta reseña. Sobre el infierno ya hice una reseña anterior, por ello no hablo aquí mucho de eso. Lo que se ha dilucidado es enorme, aquí he copiado unas pocas cosas, pero finalmente quisiera hablar del último canto, el XXXIII, número sagrado podría decirse, que representa la Santísima Trinidad, que justamente es al rededor de la cual gira literalmente este canto, el cual inicia con una oración/alabanza a María, quien sería la única vía al encuentro con Dios, sin su intercesion Dante no puede acceder a la visión de Dios y la trinidad que son uno. Este canto es extático, Dante dice todo el tiempo que no puede explicar lo que ve, que no hay palabras para ello. San Bernardo, quien es ahora su guía despues de que Beatriz, su guía durante los otros cielos desapareciera en silencio (al igual que lo hizo Virgilio) le pide a María que guarde a Dante del mal camino, es decir, volverá purificado a la tierra y no volverá a pecar. Este viaje es la salvación de Dante. Ahora logra ver la luz divina, pero ya no solo la mira, penetra en ella y su rostro es el rostro mismo de Dios, se funde en él. Ahora puede ver los tres círculos de la santísima Trinidad, los dos que representan al padre y al hijo y el tercero que emana de ellos, que es el Espíritu Santo. Logra ver a Cristo, su rostro humano, y trata de entender lo que ve como un geómatra intenta comprender un círculo. No lo logra hasta que con un golpe en su mente lo llegó a entender, o sea de un porrazo, que es la iluminación última, cuando la visión pierde fuerza, por lo que se entiende que desaparece todo lo que ve, pero, como dice, su voluntad y su deseo ya eran "rueda constante del amor que mueve el sol y las demás estrellas", es decir, ya era uno con Dios. Es una imagen portentosa y maravillosa esta. El amor es movimiento infinito, y ahora Dante gira en ese amor perpetuamente...Dante ahora está en mi Párnaso junto con Cervantes, Shakespeare y Homero. (Aunque esta es una relectura, ahora la he leído a profundidad y con notas explicativas, estudios introductorios y hasta una biografía de Dante).
4068555328	George Steiner notes that likely it is only music and mathematics which can begin to reflect the expansive majesty of thought. Philosophy pursues such but an inclination to systems and other ordered orientation tempers the vigor. He then states that it is the aphoristic thinkers who come closest and it is from that vantage that one can revel in the grandeur of poetry. Valery and Heidegger understood this. It is a vision of the cosmos which likely extends back to the pre-socratics. I’m not sure if this exclusive project was the ambition of Dante, but who else could carry the torch from Virgil and Ovid, who else could synthesize the disparate of both Grace and what exists Beyond Good and Evil? Predictably I loved the Inferno, liked Purgatory (especially Virgil and the poets) and pondered the implications of this Green Zone, I mean Paradise. Negotiating the strictures and commandments is tricky. I didn’t find any overt abatement of beer drinking. Unfortunately local politics mar this endeavor. History and Tom Eliot appear to have given the Florentine a pass.This was an encouraging instance of literary fidelity, one where I read the Commedia from beginning to end, with no distraction, dalliance or pursuit of anything else.

To bring such visions and ideas to life, Dante brings forth such an intense perception of punishment, philosophy, the afterlife, and love. A timeless journey, everyone should read it at least once.
1078799194	Tengo dos razones por las cuales quise leer La Dinvina Comedia.1. Pretendo leer Inferno de Dan Brown en algún momento de mi vida y me parecía irrespetuoso (¿?) no leer la obra en la que fue basado antes.2. Porque soy una friki cuasi gamer y sí, me gusta Devil May Cry *la echan de GoodReads* Resulta que en la saga de videojuegos hay bastantes simbolismos con respecto a La Divina Comedia, y cada uno de los nombres de los personajes se corresponde con alguna que otra aparición dentro de la novela. Como obvio no pude quedarme cruzada de brazos ante la curiosidad, me dije "Bueno, si un videojuego me hace leer, bienvenido sea". Las razones son estúpidas, pero no me arrepiento.Me alegra tener también ciertos conocimientos previos a la lectura de este libro. La verdad que la edición que me compré ayudó muchísimo. Está escrito en prosa y contiene numerosas aclaraciones al pie de las páginas que me detallan todo mejor (por supuesto que con el tiempo se volvieron medio molestas, porque como que interrumpen la lectura). El prólogo de Jorge Luis Borges también está muy bonito. Antes de leer La Divina Comedia, recomendaría un par de cosas:•Tener mínima idea de los planteos de Platón y Aristóteles•Haber leído al menos uno de los libros de Platón (recomiendo El Banquete, es uno de los más fáciles y llevaderos), pues la manera de escribir y de plantear las cosas de Dante me fueron muy parecidas a las de él•Gustar mucho de la mitología y saber de antemano las diversas leyendas y los diferentes nombres con los que se conocieron a los dioses griegos/romanos•Haber estudiado algo de Catequesis en el colegio, o tener algún conocimiento de la Biblia, ya que hay demasiadas referencias a los sucesos del Nuevo y Antiguo Testamento. En fin, creo que no es un libro para cualquiera. Sinceramente no esperaba encontrarme con nada, así que todo fue novedoso. No digo que se haya vuelto denso, sino que repetitivo. Canto tras canto Dante va conociendo personas y personas que narran sus experiencias y vos estás ahí diciendo "¿Yyyyy amigo, para cuándo algo?". El tema de los círculos tanto en el Infierno como en el Purgatorio era lo que más me interesaba y por lo que La Divina Comedia más es conocida. El Paraíso me sorprendió, no esperaba que estuviera dividido de esa forma. Me encariñé demasiado con Vergil. Digoooo, el poeta Virgilio. Y con Dante. Bastante. Me puso un poco nerviosa la cantidad de veces que Dante mencionaba la belleza inmaculada de Beatriz, pero supongo que se lo puedo perdonar. En fin, nada, eso, vayan a jugar los videojuegos. EEEEH a leer el libro.

228664336	For the Celebrity Death Match Review Tournament, The Divine Comedy versus 1984Gabriel, Michael and RaphaelCelestial ArchitectsEternityDear Mr. O'Brien,Thank you for your response to our recent tender. After due deliberation, we must regretfully inform you that we have decided not to implement your interesting plan for restructuring and downsizing the afterlife.Our accounting department confirms your statement that it would be more cost-effective only to retain Hell and wind up operations in Purgatory and Paradise. This would, however, directly conflict with our mission statement, which involves offering the chance of salvation to each and every soul. Our senior counsel, based on numerous precedents, contests your claim that this is in principle equivalent with "a boot grinding a human face, forever".We appreciate your ingenious compromise suggestion that the "integrated afterlife experience", as you describe it, could be administered by a board chaired by the late Pope Boniface VIII, and accept that this offer was made in good faith. None the less, our feeling is that Signor Boniface is not in all respects a suitable person to fill this role. The above notwithstanding, we are agreeable to implementing several of the specific points listed in Appendix C which concern improvements to the current structure of Hell. In particular, we will shortly be commencing an upgrade programme according to which the jaws of His Infernal Majesty will be substantially expanded. We are pleased to inform you that the work will be completed well before your own demise, according to our records scheduled for April 19, 1993, and we have already reserved a place for you next to Signor Cassius.Yours sincerely,Gabriel

3496209501	The Devine Comedy, a classic/poetry book, was a 5+ star read. This epic poem centers around main character Dante and his travels through Hell, Purgatory and Paradise. The Divine Comedy is a work of art and I’m truly glad I read it- that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a difficult read and I did some heavy research before tackling it. I honestly wanted to understand what I was reading and who the characters mentioned were. Dante’s journey through Hell (Inferno) was the most exciting and interesting part of the book because of the dark and creepy atmosphere, followed closely by Paradiso. I struggled to get through Purgatorio and though not as captivating as Inferno, I did manage to finish it. Just a side note about the book itself. I bought a Barnes and Noble leather bound copy and anyone wanting to read this should definitely take a look-with the gilded edges, larger size and beautiful pictures throughout, it makes the reading of The Divine Comedy much more pleasurable. Highly recommend!

6695488	Sure--why not write a trite, pithy review of one of the great works of Western Literature? Fuck it! Yes, it's beautifully poetic, but Dante is also intolerably self-righteous and hilariously bitter in it, skewering, roasting, and tearing to pieces (quite literally) his detractors, enemies, and some people that he maybe just didn't like much. The tortures are sometimes hilarious and in no way biblical...it is disturbing to think that people used to believe a lot of this silliness...oh, and that some people still do. Although surely most modern Catholics (excepting, perhaps, the Appenines) don't think that the herds of Satan's chattel are so swollen with old Italian aristocracy. Funny to think of the same old people STILL being tortured now...maybe even Cain, and of course, Old Scratch himself, still locked in that sheet of ice. I'd be mad too. I think I'd probably cut a Vanni Fucci figure in hell...you're going to be tortured forever anyway...why not give god the finger and scream and fart every minute of the day and let everybody know what a bastard he is? The losers falling into line and cowering under the black pitch might as well grow some balls...Are you allowed to use naughty words on Goodreads?
643795530	Having a surfeit of time with which to listen to audiobooks since starting my new job, I decided that I might as well revisit this old classic. The recording was a good one—featuring musical interludes in between each canto—and so I prepared myself for some Christian epicness. But now, having finished, I’m somewhat disappointed.I know that the fault is not Dante’s (well, at least not mainly his fault), since I liked the poem so much the first time. I would suggest that it was because I listened to it rather than read it, but that hasn’t prevented my enjoyment of anything else. It could be the translation. The version used in the audiobook was decidedly inferior to the Longfellow translation I originally read—being more prosaic and modern. But the strange thing was that Dante, stripped of his poetic trappings and presented as a story, became petty.Yes: there is a current of extraordinary pettiness that runs through The Divine Comedy. With the bitterness of an exile, Dante puts all of his political enemies in Hell, all of his allies in Purgatory or Heaven. To a modern reader this may seem merely natural. But consider: he is attempting a narrative that seeks to integrate all human and divine knowledge—to integrate both pagan and Christian art forms—and Dante still can’t help taking jabs at his foes.Also stunning is his arrogance. Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven notwithstanding, the only thing supernatural about this poem is Dante’s ego. He could have made anyone the hero: St. Thomas Aquinas, Charlemagne, St. Augustine. But he chose himself. Dante is Dante’s own hero. How could the man—who had never done anything extraordinary in his life—venture to portray himself as such a favorite of God that he would be led up to the highest sphere of Heaven itself? What’s more, he sets Beatrice—the woman he lusted after—nearly on a level with the Virgin Mary! Just think about that for a second. Throughout the entire poem Dante is presuming to know the Mind of God. What profounder blasphemy can be committed by a poet? It’s absurd, really.But I bet I would have a similarly disappointed reaction to a modernized and simplified version of Shakespeare. Poetry without the poetry is paltry. And who am I—who is writing an internet book review on one of the greatest poems of all time—to judge another for being arrogant?
3156712088	FINALLY. I have finally read this book till the end! I wished I would have read this book while going to school. Since Dante has included so many well-known fiction and non-fiction figures from his time, it was hard to follow each poem because I had to look up and memorize which figure was where out of which reason. Thankfully, the book version had a comprehensive introduction explaining the background of Dante and added additional remarks to names mentioned in the poems itself. As mentioned in one of my previous reviews, I don't know poems well but with this book, I understood the charming effect of this literature form. The vocabulary, the atmosphere and the relationship of Dante and the other characters were beautifully used to create a capturing voyage through hell and paradise. I can't imagine what a genius Dante must have been to create such a master piece. I wished I could read this in the original language. It doesn't matter how well a translation is done, the aura of the book gets lost to some extent after translating.
1339547535	Apenas 50 anos após a sua morte, Florença que tinha exilado Dante (1265-1321), resolveu reganhar consciência e como tributo criar o Departamento de Estudos da Divina Comédia, oferecendo o cargo de diretor a Giovanni Boccaccio, poeta que tinha já escrito uma biografia sobre Dante (1357). Depois disso nada mais seria igual, a influência de Dante iria estender-se no espaço e no tempo, influenciando criações em todos os media e artes, como nenhuma outra obra, talvez rivalizada apenas pela própria Bíblia. Dante foi perseguido em vida, mas imortalizado na sua morte.[Para ler com imagens e links, seguir para: https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/...]Não é hoje muito relevante compreender os problemas de Dante em Florença já que as razões se prenderam com os clãs familiares da época e a relação entre a igreja e os governos. Mas é importante compreender que a Divina Comédia, escrito em exílio, funciona como uma espécie de resposta a todos aqueles que o perseguiram, uma vez que vão sendo amiúde distribuídos pela jornada encetada, do Inferno ao Paraíso, passando pelo Purgatório. Talvez não tenha sido fácil para muitos, ler no texto, escrito na língua comum, o Toscano e que viria a servir de base ao Italiano de hoje, acessível a toda a população letrada e não apenas a elite, os pecados e os potenciais castigos esperados. Num tempo, ainda muito dominado pela obscuridade, ver plasmado num conjunto de linhas a descrição daquilo que os esperava após a morte, terá tido o seu efeito. Mas talvez mais interessante, é que esse efeito, talvez pensado por Dante, foi muito para além dos seus alvos e tempo, nos séculos que se sucederam, mesmo com o Renascentismo e depois o Iluminismo, Dante continuou a pairar sobre nós, e isso é em parte aquilo que mais me intrigou ao longo de toda a leitura, e que procurei tentar perceber, tanto a partir do texto como de leituras adicionais."Os círculos do Inferno de Dante" (1481) de Sandro Botticelli "Inferno" (1826) por William BlakeMas antes de entrar nessa discussão, quero dar conta de forma muito sucinta do impacto que já referi acima, mas referindo alguns exemplos. Assim a originalmente intitulada “Comedia”, seria rebatizada de “Divina Comédia” por Boccaccio, especula-se que muito por influência da terceira parte, o Paraíso, de que falarei a seguir. No século seguinte, nada menos que Sandro Botticelli (1481) desenvolverá o primeiro grande conjunto de ilustrações para a “Divina Comédia”. Depois, Geoffrey Chaucer, que tal como Dante, se tornaria pai de uma das línguas de hoje, no caso o Inglês, com a sua obra “The Canterbury Tales” (1483), não só traduziria como reconheceria nas suas obras a influência de Dante. Depois em 1667 seria a vez de John Milton confrontar diretamente a obra a de Dante com o seu grande poema épico “Paraíso Perdido”. Balzac também não se coibiria de batizar a sua série de romances sociais como “A Comédia Humana” (1850), numa clara referência à Comédia. Depois William Blake faria mais um conjunto de ilustrações para a Divina Comédia (1826), mas a sua morte impossibilitaria terminar o trabalho iniciado, contudo esse mesmo seria retomado por Gustave Doré (1861) que viria a oferecer à obra uma ilustração por canto, e de tal forma relevante, que nos dias de hoje se torna quase indissociável da Comédia. Ainda no século XIX a música faria grandes homenagens, com "A Sinfonia de Dante" por Liszt (1856) e "Francesca da Rimini" de Tchaikovsky (1876). Já no século XX, Salvador Dali (1950) não poderia passar sem realizar uma tentativa de ilustrar a Comédia, e por fim não poderia deixar de citar, a fantástica escultura a “Porta do Inferno” por Auguste Rodin (1917).“Porta do Inferno” (1917) de Auguste RodinContudo o reconhecimento não se limita às artes. Fora delas, na própria ciência, Dante foi reconhecido, e pode-se dizer mesmo que pode ter servido de motor a algumas das principais ideias da Renascença italiana, existindo quem associe o pensamento de Galilei Galileu à Divina Comédia. A verdade é que lendo a obra, por várias vezes nos deparamos com ideias sobre a realidade baseadas em ciência e não mero senso comum, desde a Terra esférica, à força da gravidade, passando pela astronomia, e até o próprio método experimental. Isto demonstra várias coisas, primeiro que a idade média, ainda que aqui tardia, não foi as trevas que durante muitos anos se venderam e que tiveram de esperar pela Renascença para voltar à vida. Por outro lado, Dante cita abundantemente Aristoteles e vários outros pensadores gregos e romanos, ou seja a sua formação estava muito longe de se encerrar por um véu teológico, como por vezes a obra parece querer fazer crer.Dante AlighieriAliás, tenho de dizer que talvez aquilo que mais me impressionou na leitura de Dante, foi a avidez com que referenciava autores e criadores, das artes, ciência e teologia. Aliás, veja-se desde logo o facto de Dante iniciar a sua jornada pelo Inferno pela mão de ninguém menos do que o poeta do grande épico da Roma Antiga, Virgilio, com quem vai dialogando trazendo para dentro da sua obra factos da história de Roma. Mas são inúmeras as citações, e por isso a certa altura questionava-me sobre algo que já me fui questionando nesta minha senda pela leitura dos clássicos, e que tem que ver com a proximidade entre o discurso académico e o discurso das obras clássicas imortais. São raras as obras que perduraram, que não referenciaram quem veio antes de si. Se numa primeira impressão podemos ficar com aquela ideia do senso comum, de que o autor está apenas a dar espaço à vaidade de mostrar que conhece, na verdade é muito mais do que isso, sendo homenagem, é mais, porque é antes o reconhecimento do conhecimento e civilização até ali construída. É identificação com as ideias e mundo dos que nos precederam, para a partir deles ir mais longe. O conhecimento só se eleva assente nos ombros daqueles que nos precederam. É por isso que é importante estudá-los, lê-los, conhecê-los. Não se cria no vazio, ou cria, mas nunca teríamos chegado até ao ponto civilizacional em que nos encontramos, se cada um de nós, tivesse sempre reiniciado o processo do zero.Por isso não admira ler Cervantes, Shakespeare, ou Virgilio, ou ainda Marco Aurélio e Montaigne, ou mais recentemente Dostoiévski, Tolstoi, Vitor Hugo, Emile Zola, Proust, Mann, ou Pessoa, e ver como eles não têm pudor em homenagear quem serviu para que se elevassem acima do que existia. E por isso também não admira que Dante seja referenciado por T.S. Eliot, E.M. Forster, Jorge Luis Borges, Primo Levi, Samuel Beckett, Bret Easton Ellis, David Fincher, Stephen King ou Dan Brown. Dante tornou-se referência obrigatória para quem precisa de referir o lugar do inferno, e por isso o seu nome viria a assumir a forma de adjetivo, para qualificar tudo aquilo que ao inferno diz respeito."Purgatório" (1960's) de Salvador Dali"Se7en" (1995) de David FincherEsta referência ao inferno por Dante, ou melhor, a omnipresença de Dante nas referências ao inferno, fizeram com que a certa altura acreditasse que Dante poderia ter sido o grande responsável pela criação de tal figura, ou pelo menos no instigador das imagens horrendas que o inferno possui no imaginário ocidental, mas não é assim. Dante baseia-se no conhecimento da altura, existiam vários relatos teológicos que se apresentavam como descrições factuais daquilo que seria o inferno, o purgatório e o paraíso. Aliás, nas minhas pesquisas encontrei mesmo uma visualização desse mesmo inferno, que não dista muito daquilo que Dante nos viria a dar, criada para uma enciclopédia medieval, a “Hortus Deliciarum” (1195) (ver imagem abaixo), por uma mulher, a abadessa Herrad de Landsberg. Já não surpreende ver mulheres surgirem na frente de muitos homens, tem sido já neste século que temos vindo a descobrir a história de grandes mulheres deixadas na obscuridade — ex. Ada Lovelace, Hedy Lamarr ou Katherine Johnson. Neste caso Landsberg vivia com a sua ordem enclausurada num convento, usando esta enciclopédia para o ensino."Inferno" (1195) por Herrad de LandsbergVoltando ao texto, mas antes ainda primeiro ao processo de leitura, para poder dar conta da experiência da obra. Comecei pela tradução de Vasco Graça Moura, mas ao fim de poucas páginas parei, não pela dificuldade de leitura apenas, mas por ter percebido que não se pode ler Dante sem ler primeiro um conjunto de outras obras. Dante viaja ao inferno pela mão de Virgilio, desse modo é obrigatório ler antes a “Eneida”, a obra maior de Virgilio. Por outro lado, a Eneida é um relato baseado no pós-guerra de Tróia, de modo que se torna obrigatório ler antes também a "Ilíada" e a "Odisseia". Seria interessante ler ainda algumas tragédias gregas de Sófocles, Ésquilo e Eurípedes, já que elas acrescentam bastante à mitologia de Homero, mas não o fiz, e como já tinha lida a "Odisseia", li então a "Ilíada" e "Eneida", e voltei a Dante. Ao chegar de novo à Comédia, fui confrontado com o facto de ter lido a “Eneida” na tradução portuguesa mais comum, dos colegas da Faculdade de Letras de Lisboa, e que está em prosa. Resolvi então procurar traduções em prosa da Comédia, já que as em verso que tinha visto eram bastante inferiores à de Moura. Foi assim que encontrei a belíssima tradução do escritor brasileiro, Hernâni Donato, para a Cultrix, de 1979, que acabou por me abrir as portas a Dante de uma forma que não encontrei em mais nenhuma outra tradução.Em termos académicos, a tradução de Moura é irrepreensível, e para quem quiser estudar a obra em profundidade, não existe alternativa, até porque a obra vem no formato bilingue, com o texto original lado a lado. Mas para quem quiser entrar no mundo de Dante, experimentar a sua imaginação, Donato faz um belíssimo trabalho. Moura faz uma tradução excepcional, totalmente colada ao original, usando inclusive português arcaico, e acima de tudo, mantendo a “terça rima” (ABA, BCB, CDC, DED) de Dante. Ora o problema, para além do vocabulário arcaico, é que a rima usada por Dante acabou por condicionar, se assim quisermos dizer, o conteúdo em virtude da forma. Ou seja, a economia de texto exigida pelos versos, aliada ao facto de Dante estar a apontar o dedo a figuras conhecidas, conduziu Dante a construir um texto que vai mascarando ideias, nomeadamente pelo minimalismo, que deixa de fora da compreensão quem não detenha uma base de contexto sobre a obra e o autor. E é essa contextualização que Donato faz muito bem na conversão para prosa, não apenas com notas de rodapé, mas na reconstrução dos sentidos do texto. Por outro lado, a versão de Moura consegue um tom muito mais próximo de Dante, algo a que Donato claramente foge. Na leitura de Moura, sentimos a rispidez, o cru e vulgaridade que Dante quis denotar pelo uso da língua comum, o italiano. Já Donato, acaba por embelezar bastante o texto, mantendo as três partes sempre num mesmo tom, prazeiroso e muito acolhedor, mas igual. Ainda para ajudar à leitura, comprei também o livro das ilustrações de Gustave Doré, que fui usando apenas quando terminava cada livro, para poder confrontar o que tinha lido e sentido, com as visualizações proporcionadas por Doré que de certo modo acabam funcionando como sínteses de cada canto.Dito tudo isto, de que fala afinal a Divina Comédia? Julgo que isso não tem nada de novo, é sobejamente conhecido, mas aqui fica. A obra está dividia em três livros, com 33 cantos cada um, à exceção do primeiro que tem mais um que serve de introdução, perfazendo os 100 cantos. O primeiro livro retrata o Inferno, e é o mais conhecido, assim como o mais popular, tanto para quem lê, como para quem acusa a influência de Dante. O relato é muito direto, vamos pela mão de Dante, que pela sua vez vai pela mão de Virgilio, ao longo dos vários círculos que constituem o Inferno, e no qual vamos encontrando as figuras mais macabras, sendo que Dante não se coíbe de listar quem da sua realidade ali vai encontrando. Dante não morreu, a sua descida ao Inferno, deve-se ao facto de ir atrás da sua amada, Beatrice, que morreu. Por isso Dante é um ser-vivo que se passeia pelo mundo dos mortos gerando muita interrogação e má-disposição nalguns dos membros desse mundo que vai encontrando."Beata Beatrix" (1870) de Dante Gabriel RossettiNo segundo livro descemos/subimos (pela inversão esférica do mundo) ao Purgatório e é onde vamos encontrar um novo conjunto de personagens também reais, que aguardam pela sua conversão ou purga dos pecados. É neste livro que Dante ilustra os 7 Pecados Capitais, ou vícios — Gula, Avareza, Luxúria, Ira, Inveja, Preguiça e Soberba — que estão dispersos por cada círculo do Purgatório. Este livro é menos envolvente que o primeiro, porque menos claro no que pretende dizer, até porque os personagens estão em trânsito, e existe muita indefinição.No último livro, chegamos ao Paraíso, o fim da viagem, agora já não com Virgilio, mas pela mão de Beatrice que nos leva à presença de algumas das figuras mais relevantes de Roma e da história cristã —São Tomás de Aquino, São Francisco de Assis, Carlos Magno, Trajano, Constantino, alguns apóstolos, Adão — até ao estágio final do encontro com Deus. Por isso dizia acima, que o acrescento de Divina ao Comédia, por Bocaccio fazia todo o sentido. Neste livro sentimos o aspeto teológico muito presente, mas ao mesmo tempo uma espécie de liberação de Dante, como se os questionamentos lançados iluminassem o caminho, e tornassem mais claro o propósito não só da viagem, mas do todo.Da minha experiência retiro essencialmente o sentimento de proximidade com a História que o livro me proporcionou, e que não tinha sentido tanto com Homero, apesar de ter sentido com Marco Aurélio. Durante a leitura senti como se viajasse no tempo, como se as linhas que tinha na mão fizessem parte de um tempo remoto, e eu tivesse o enorme privilégio de aceder por meio delas a esse tempo. A leitura funcionou em certa medida, como quando visitamos um monumento histórico, com séculos de história e nos sentamos ali por um pedaço de tempo, a imaginar o que teriam pensado e vivido as pessoas que por ali passaram séculos ou milhares de anos antes de nós. Como se as pedras nos pudessem transmitir parte dessa História, vidas passadas, mas contudo plasmadas em pedras trabalhadas, e aqui nas palavras de Dante, escritas há 700 anos."O Empíreo" (1861) por Gustave Doré Como disse no início, Dante é um dos poucos imortais, e explicar porquê não é fácil, porque estão implicadas imensas variáveis, não é apenas o texto, é também a sua forma, a língua escolhida, o momento da sua escrita, a região em que foi escrito, e depois tudo o que foram dizendo aqueles que lhe sucederam. Contudo acredito que para além de tudo o que já disse acima, o facto de ter escrito sobre um tema que a todos toca de muito perto, e tê-lo feito com tanta naturalidade, ainda que contaminado de muitas ilusões impostas pelas lógicas religiosas, contribuiu para que todos os que vieram depois dele, se tivessem interessado em saber o que tinha para nos dizer. Ler hoje Dante já não se faz para encontrar respostas, mas não deixa de nos ajudar a compreender de onde viemos, nomeadamente para todos os que fazem parte da sociedade ocidental marcada pela matriz cristã.Publicado no VI em: https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/...
5955499522	Merhaba, ben geldim. Uzun yollar yürüdüm de geldim, Dante ile öte dünyanın sayısız dairesini yürüdüm, yürüye yürüye cehennemin en dışından arafa vardım, günahlarımız bir bir silindi, yolun sonunda cennete vardık. Uzun, çok uzun bir yolculuktu - ama ne yolculuk!İlahi Komedya'yı burada anlatmak şüphesiz imkansız, bu kitabı genel olarak anlatmak mümkün mü onu da bilmiyorum gerçi. Batı edebiyatının kurucu metinlerinden biri kendisi malum, sayısız kez incelenmiş, sökülmüş yeniden yapılmış, didiklenmiş bir metin. Ben de zaten okuduğum kitaplarda sürekli olarak kendisine verilen referansları artık daha iyi anlamak istediğim için cesaret edip okudum. Buraya bir küçük not düşeyim: mevzubahis 700 sayfalık bir şiir olunca, elbette çeviri meselesi büyük önem kazanıyor. Bizdeki yaygın kabul ödül de almış olan Rekin Teksoy çevirisinden okumak, ben de vaktiyle ona biraz göz gezdirmiştim. Yakın zamanda Alfa'dan çıkan Seçkin Erdi çevirisini tercih etme sebebim hem bu yeni çeviriye bir şans vermek, hem bu çevirinin orijinal İtalyanca metnin 18, 19 ve 20. yüzyıllardan üç ayrı İngilizce çeviriyle kelime kelime karşılaştırılarak hazırlanmış olması, hem de William Blake'in meşhur resimlerinin bu baskıda ilgili bölümlere yerleştirilmiş olması idi. Ben tercihimden memnun kaldım ama tabii Rekin Teksoy çevirisi de başka bir deneyim, farkındayım.Dediğim gibi, anlatmak çok zor; hissetmek, deneyimlemek lazım bu metni. Homeros, Vergilius ve Ovidius'un metinleri kadar büyük ve onlara sırtını yaslayarak yükselen bir şiir bu. Özellikle Cehennem'in dokuz dairesini dolaşırken ortaya koyduğu siyasi alegoriler, yedi ölümcül günahın izinde Araf'ı gezerken sunduğu evrensel perspektif, Cennet bölümünde Papalık makamına yaptığı eleştirilerin hepsi zamanının çok ötesinde, çok şaşırtıcı, çok büyüleyici.Bir de tabii ünlü Beatrice ile -özellikle Cennet bölümünde- yakından tanışmak ve Dante'nin herbiri birbirinden lezzetli kelimeleriyle hemhal olmak pek tarifsiz bir deneyimdi. Anlatıp duruyorum ama sözcük bu işte aslında: tarifsiz. Kendini hazır hisseden her okurun yolu buraya çıksın dilerim.Bu uzun yolculuğun sonundaki vaziyetimi de yine Dante tariflesin madem: "Ölmedim, ama diri de değilim." :)
568916801	Dante's Divine Comedy is the worst book that I have read in my life, and that means a lot, because I also have read "Twilight", well at least tried the first 50 pages. Dante's imagery is powerful, yet it serves no purpose. Basically Dante goes through hell, just watching people suffer, through eternity, then goes to purgatory and then to heaven where he finally meets Beatrice. Even though poem is written in three line stanzas and each line has exactly 11 syllables it is not lyrical at all, it is impossible to read on, the sentences are written in a manner that makes one wonder where the first idea stopped and where the second one began. Dante simply posed his opinions on what is the "Worst" sin, he sent people who were born before Christianity was formed to hell, some to suffer in deeps of hell and some were in the first circle, and ALL of them were repenting. I can't even imagine what was passing in Dante's mind when he was writing all those tortures, my personal theory is that he had serious mental disorder. Undoubtedly the Comedy has it's value as the first book of Renaissance( or last book before Renaissance, make your pick), but it is of no importance today, it can give no joy to the reader, and the ideas expressed in the book are rare, old-fashioned and sometimes stupid. Overall, don't waste your time reading the Divine Comedy, unless of course you enjoy these kinds of books, or you have it as a task in your Literature syllabus, and have to write a literary analysis on it (like me).

3889023046	Gli anniversari sono dei motori di attenzione, di stimoli di solito fatui, ma a volte anche potenti.Questo anniversario dantesco ha messo in moto un sacco di meccanismi editoriali. E così mi sono trovato, impigliato in uno di questi, a dovermi leggere finalmente in modo sistematico, radiografico, la Divina Commedia per tirarne fuori cose strane che non è qui il caso di dire. (“Dovermi” parla di una rogna, “finalmente” di un desiderio. Vere tutte e due le cose.)Scrivo due righe solo per lo scrupolo che magari l’esperienza possa attrarre o magari persino essere tecnicamente utile.Il piano iniziale (frutto di una mediazione. Al ribasso!) era da scappare.Introduzione al singolo canto (testo base per questa fase 1, proprio il Sermonti, in tre preziosi volumi, ma su RaiPlay ci sono anche i filmati di tutte le sue letture dal vivo: meglio di qualsiasi serie tv). Poi prima lettura, perifrasi (testo base, la versione digitale UTET: agile, rigorosa, efficace); infine seconda lettura. Rilettura complessiva delle tre cantiche alla fine della lettura di tutti i canti di ciascuna. Rilettura finale generale. Tempo impiegato: cinque mesi. Per fare una cosa seria, farsi sconti significa rimetterci.Soprattutto perché, nel durante, dalla prima terzina e per tutte le tre cantiche, scopri e ti ritrovi a godere di una splendida vacanza di lettura, un libro-mondo, come dice Sermonti (se l’aldilà esiste Dante lo ha assunto, sicuro).Un viaggio avventurosissimo, una serie di incontri altrimenti inimmaginabili, un gioco enigmistico da professionisti, un ripasso enciclopedico, un continuo aprirsi di scorci mentali abissali, di visuali imprevedibili, di panorami mentali e geospaziali mozzafiato, di una folla di personaggi uno più strano e fascinoso dell'altro, di rimandi labirintici, di invettive implacabili, di spudorate confessioni. Ci si trova davanti ad una bellezza espressiva sovrumana (è possibile fare di più con le cose semplicemente nominandole?), di architettura dei versi in simmetrie perfette, frutto di lucidissima ed autentica follia.E poi ti fai una amicizia vera con un compagno di viaggio capace di ire e dolcezze esagerate, affidabile e premuroso, intollerante e malinconico, severissimo e compassionevole.Con un finale apertissimo, sorprendente, insondabile, frutto di una delle sensibilità estetiche, mistiche e poetiche più estreme che si siano mai manifestate al mondo.Bene. Il mio dovere di lettore social io l'ho assolto.Se a questo punto, a qualcuno fosse balenata la tentazione di imbarcarsi, ecco quel che Dante mette sulla carta di imbarco della tappa più perigliosa e abbacinante, il Paradiso (ma vale per tutto il viaggio)“O voi che siete in piccioletta barca,desiderosi d’ascoltar, seguìtidietro al mio legno che cantando varca,tornate a riveder li vostri liti:non vi mettete in pelago, ché, forse,perdendo me, rimarreste smarriti.L’acqua ch’io prendo già mai non si corse”
1503679644	El "Infierno" es más verosímil que la vida diaria; el "Purgatorio" aburre como una alusión a la existencia. El "Paraíso" es ilegible e inverosímil, como cualquier alarde de felicidad. La trilogía de Dante es el ejemplo vivo de la incapacidad del hombre de soportar la redención sin aburrimiento y la mayor rehabilitación del diablo concebida alguna vez por un cristiano.Emil Cioran, Extravíos, Madrid, Hermida Editores, 2018El purgatorio de Dante sólo puede ascenderse de día, pues durante la noche la voluntad humana se diluye ensombrecida por el brillo de las estrellas, y de su infierno sólo se puede huir trepando por las piernas del diablo, aún a riesgo de sucumbir a sus encantos para siempre. Sólo por esas dos enseñanzas, bien merece la pena seguir los pasos de Virgilio. El paraíso, en cambio, es un lugar bostezable, teórico, excesivamente Ptolomeico, lo que en sí mismo va en detrimento de su posible existencia. Dante se pone a hablarnos de esferas, como si se creyera un Aristóteles renacentista, como si estuviese murmurando en el sueño pesado al que da paso el Loracepam. Bien despierto, ojiplático, refiere el purgatorio y el infierno, y vaya si ambos resultan creíbles y electrizantes; pero en el cielo no cabe más que silencio, conjetura, tedio, pues se encuentra tan sólo en un lugar recóndito de la mente, un lugar hasta donde las ilusiones, por suerte, no lograrán nunca llevarnos del todo. No hay imágenes, nada que pueda tocarse, es un mero cebo cognitivo. Lo fundamental de esta obra es que después de una larga noche en los tiempos, llamada Edad Media, resurgen la naturaleza y el hombre como protagonistas, y no Dios. Dios está ahí, presente, pero nunca nos habla más que a través de las voces de sus criaturas. Se funden lo pagano y lo ortodoxo y ambos tienen un mismo gran valor, que es el de haber sido ideados por nuestra culpa y nuestra fe, desde el principio; la vida no es más que un purgatorio y cielo e infierno son meras alegorías de la culpa y la esperanza.Dante asciende en busca de Beatriz y no de Dios, sabiendo eso no queda mucho que decir. Es todo un hereje. Si las virtudes de un clásico son la pervivencia y la universalidad, La divina comedia lo es con mayúsculas. Ningún avance científico ni diferencia religiosa o cultural podrá hacer que dejemos de temer ese drama subterráneo tan creíblemente bosquejado, tan repleto de pasiones irredentas y experiencias horríficas, ni por supuesto, que dejemos de sentir como nuestra esa tierra angosta y escarpada del purgatorio, donde el vértigo de dar el siguiente paso es lo único importante, lo que nos mantiene despiertos; donde parece que si nos detenemos una vez ya no llegaremos nunca. Este es uno de esos libros de los que uno no debería desprenderse jamás; a los que conviene regresar de vez en cuando para encontrarse.
656491166	04/25/22Well, for the second time, my journey is over. When I first read The Divine Comedy nearly nine years ago, I viewed the great poem primarily as an academic exercise, Dante's effort to collate the sum total of earthly and heavenly knowledge into a single Epic of Existence. Now that I'm closer to the age Dante was when he wrote it (a deeply humbling thought), I can see more clearly how intensely personal this project was for him; how it reflects, at the christening of his personal maturity, Dante's spiritual need to burst free from his own insularity, to find a truer Self than the chimera he had fastened in adolescence and young manhood by rushing out of himself and into everyone else - men, beasts, angels, poets, kings, saints, friends, popes, heroes, and the Holy Trinity. He could no longer live in the ego-self to which he clung with such tenacity in his youth. He had to lose his soul in heaven and hell in order to find it; to reveal himself to himself through the medium of Love, given and received in one immanent and transcendent mystery. Did he find what he was looking for? Perhaps that answer waits for a later stage of our life's journey. 07/18/2013Dante's Divine Comedy is one of the classics of western literature for a reason. It represents, in many respects, the intellectual summation of the high middle ages. It is riddled with symbols and allegory, frequent references to classical history and mythology, and sports, particularly in Paradiso, an impressively deep exploration of theological questions and the nature of divinity and divine love. The extent to which contemporary political questions figure prominently in the narrative was surprising to me. Dante holds nothing back in indicting the church for straying from its official mission and for the corruption of its leaders - perhaps most famously in a humorous meeting between Dante and Pope Nicholas III in Hell - as well as the decadence that gripped his native Florence. There is an unfortunate tendency in American high schools and universities to introduce students to Dante by simply showing them excerpts from Inferno and saying, "look, here's what people in the middle ages thought Hell was like!" In reality, The Divine Comedy is so much more than that. It is, in turns, a theological treatise, a political manifesto, a primer on medieval astronomy and cosmology, and, of course, an epic poem intended to carry on the tradition of Homer and Virgil. It deserves to be read and reread by students of western civilization.

2024388667	Romanian review: ,,Divina comedie" este primul diss track din istoria omenirii. Practic, Dante a trimis în iad toate persoanele care îi erau nesuferite, iar dacă te ura suficient de mult, inventa și o pseudoexplicație ca să te trimită în iad cât încă erai în viață. Mă uit la tine Papa Bonifaciu al-VIII-lea. Am fost surprins cât de mult din această carte este o operă politică. Dante își critică adversarii politici, critică corupția politicienilor și a papei, degradarea orașului Florența și multe alte persoane și instituții.,,Divina comedie" se află într-o categorie aparte de cărți care au primit de la mine cinci stele, pentru că pentru mine un rol fundamental în notarea unei cărți îl reprezintă experiența pe care am avut-o cu o carte, experiență care este pur subiectivă, iar această experiență tindea către patru stele deoarece, pe alocuri, a fost o lectură obositoare, îngreunată de o mulțime de note de subsol (pe care dacă nu le citeam, nu aș fi înțeles prea multe din simbolismul cărții), fără nicio glumă, în toată cartea există o singură pagină fără note de subsol (în ediția citită de mine), iar personajele istorice care apar în continuu în carte sunt regi, duci, principi italieni de care nu am auzit în viața mea. Totuși, ce m-a făcut să-i dau a cincea stea este că la sfârșit am rămas cu un sentiment de îmbogățire culturală aparte, cum nu am mai simțit vreodată până acum.După ce am citit Biblia, am remarcat că o descriere a infernului și a paradisului lipsește complet din cartea fundamentală a religiei creștine și am ajuns la concluzia că felul în care ne imaginăm raiul și iadul este influențat de ,,Divina comedie", iar lectura acestei cărți îmi întărește opinia.Chiar dacă Dante poate fi puțin plin de el, ironic pentru o carte care prezintă călătoria prin care el ar trebui să-și mântuiască sufletul, asta nu schimbă faptul că este un poet de-a dreptul extraordinar, iar ,,Divina comedie" este o operă greu de egalat din punct de vedere literar și artistic. Încercând să-mi găsesc cuvintele să descriu cât de superbe sunt anumite fragmente din carte, întâmpin aceeași problemă pe care a întâmpinat-o Dante când trebuia să descrie frumuseștea Beatricei, ceea ce spune extrem de multe despre cât de impresionat sunt de capodopera lui Dante Alighieri.English review: "The Divine Comedy" is the first diss track in human history. Basically, Dante sent everyone he disliked to hell, and if he hated you enough, he made up a pseudo-explanation to send you to hell while you were still alive. I'm looking at you, Pope Boniface VIII. I was surprised how much of this book is political. Dante criticizes his political opponents, criticizes the corruption of politicians and the pope, the degradation of Florence and many other people and institutions."The Divine Comedy" is in a special category of books that I gave five stars, because for me a fundamental part of rating a book is the experience I have had with a book, which is purely subjective, and that experience tended towards four stars because it was a tiresome read at times, encumbered by lots of footnotes (which if I hadn't read them, I wouldn't have understood much of the symbolism of the book), no jokes, there is only one page in the entire book without footnotes (in the edition I read), and the historical characters that keep popping up in the book are Italian kings, dukes, princes that I have never heard of in my life. What made me give it a fifth star, however, is that at the end I was left with a feeling of particular cultural enrichment, the likes of which I have never felt before.After reading the Bible, I noticed that a description of hell and paradise is completely missing from the foundational book of the Christian religion, and I came to the conclusion that the way we imagine heaven and hell is influenced by the Divine Comedy, and reading this book reinforces my opinion.Even though Dante may be a little full of himself, ironic for a book about the journey through which he is supposed to save his soul, that does not change the fact that he is a truly extraordinary poet, and the Divine Comedy is a work that is hard to match in literary and artistic terms. In trying to find the words to describe how magnificent some parts of the book are, I have the same problem that Dante had in describing the beauty of Beatrice, which says a great deal about how impressed I am by Dante Alighieri's masterpiece.
30609857	I have travelled a goodly distance since I last read the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, and what a long strange trip its been. So, it was with an introspective bit of drollness that I embarked on this reread.I was fascinated with Inferno as a teenager and between Dante Alighieri and Robert Smith/Rimbaud it is, frankly, nothing short of a miracle that I didn't put enough reasons together to wind-up as a fleshy tree with harpies perched in my branches somewhere in the lower circles of hell--if you catch my drift. Yeah, I was one tortured soul...Now, I seem to have arrived in the dread "Existance Age" of my life. In evidence, I need only cite my thinning hair, second mortgage, life insurance, and All American guilt complex. This is also why it's taking me longer than necessary to read Richard Ford's Independence Day--each line just seems like something I'm thinking, and it's hard to be objective with the reading and view it simply as a book. And, it may very well explain why, as I listened to The Divine Comedy with this audiobook edition, I found Purgatorio so fascinating--when as a teenager I couldn't skim through it fast enough.The Divine Comedy is more of a journey than a book, and as a journey it has stages and waypoints... also its not a trip everyone needs to take. I, for one, never plan on visiting Meca or for that matter, the Mormon General Conference; they're just not my kinds of trips. But, having grow-up in a Televangelist Supercult, The Divine Comedy is just the right kind of retrospective for me. Reasons are abundant but are typified by the way the book helps me look objectively at my spiritual life. Here is the short list: First, according to Dante, pretty much everybody in hell is Italian and Catholic; second, my tattoo fantasies of the illustrations by Gustave Dore; third, the striking absense of a bathroom break; fourth the paragraph-long metaphores which fill each canto in the same way a bazaar of guillemots might fill something bigger than a breadbox but smaller than a dinghy if there was but some form of guillemot filling aparatus or perhaps a working decoy; fifth, placing people I dislike in different levels of hell--BTW I've decided Walter Kirn is my arch-enemy; and sixth (but hardly last) the unanswerable question of why Dante is obsessed with a woman who isn't his wife and figures her in the seat of grace while the woman he's married to is no doubt fixing his meals, cleaning his dishes, and caring for his kids, while he is writing the Divine Comedy (like some kind of Catholic Penthouse Forum Letter) and this is somehow OK because he still makes it to heaven.I'll be honest, I've never been able to finish The Divine Comedy. I get to wandering around in Paradiso like a redneck in Walmart and keep on loosing my place due to profound boredom (unlike a redneck in Walmart). Afterall, "Heaven is a place," to quote David Byrne, "a place where nothing ever happens." Maybe someday Paradiso will be the part I just can't get enough of, but for now I'm content with my life in purgatory. I kind of like the idea that I can impress people just by casting a shadow and meeting old friends in really uncomfortable situations.
570726174	Re-Read. I mean, of course, with all those things I've read, to neglect one of the most famous of famous epic poems would be an unforgivable sin. One worthy of being sent to hell for. So, obviously, I had to read it. And I took a guide, lost a guide, and wound up messing with the spheres of heaven by the end.Because, why not?Is it a thinly-veiled condemnation of Italian peers by way of historical personages? An allegory for the Tree of Life? A personal journey of transcendentalism? A roaring road-trip good-time?Why not all these things?Classics are classics for a reason. Some can be come at from any angle. Or angel. Whatever.Good shit to revisit.Personal note:If anyone reading my reviews is be interested in reading my SF (Very hard SF, mind you), I'm open to requests.Just direct message me in goodreads or email me on my site. I'd love to get some eyes on my novels.Arctunn.com
6999391529	Teško je izmisliti toplu vodu i reći nešto o ovom vanvremenskom čudu što već nije doslovno milione puta prežvakano, preispitano i prokomentirano. Nema sumnje u uticaj koji je Danteovo maštovito proširenje biblijske teologije imalo u svim sferama italijanske, evropske i svjetske kulture. Struktura Komedije, odabir jezika, i širina Danteovog razumijevanja i poznavanja svijeta je zadivljujuće, ali budimo iskreni najveći dio njenog šarma (za mene kao površnog, neinformisanog i savremenog čitatelja) leži u činjenici da je ovo Danteov lični “burn book” - koktel njegovih ličnih zamjerki, političkih komentara i odlučnosti da sve ljude koje ne simpatiše strpa u pakao.Božanstvena Komedija je dijete srednjovjekovne ekstremne religioznosti i pristrasnosti čovjeka kome je načinjena nepravda. Intenzivno se oslanja na Bibliju, koristeći njenu strukturu i moralni okvir kao osnovu za svoju viziju zagrobnog života. Ipak, njegovo djelo je duboko lično i subjektivno, sa likovima iz njegovog života, politike i istorije koje sa velikim oduševljenjem koristi u svakoj prilici da nam stavi do znanja šta misli o doslovno svemu.Direktni citati, psalmi i pasusi Biblije su često prisutni, ali čini se da je nebiblijska hrišćanska mitologija zapravo pravi osnov romana osim ukoliko tlocrti tri zagrobna carstva nisu i tamo ovako detaljno prikazani. Danteov prikaz božanske pravde je vrlo surov i često nelogičan, što odgovara onim nepoznatim gospodnjim putevima, ali uvijek je u svojoj srži oslonjen na njegov lični stav o tome gdje ko treba da završi i kako se do kojeg nivoa savršenosti dolazi. Dante koristi biblijske ličnosti, slike i simbole da opravda svoje stavove, oni ga uvijek podržavaju, ohrabruju ga i savjetuju tako da Božanstvena komedija iako potčinjena biblijskoj teologiji zapravo služi kao kreativna reinterpretacija Biblije oblikovana Danteovim pogledima na svijet. Međutim, ne bih rekao da je ovo samo platforma za rješavanje ličnih sukoba jer kritika političke korupcije, crkve, rasparčanih italijanskih polisa je vrlo validna i uglavnom Dante ima razumne razloge za stavljanje svojih neprijatelja (npr. papa Bonifacije VIII, Filippo Argenti) u pakao (osim kada nisu potpuno sumanuti - mada i tada su u skladu sa moralnim okvirom koji si Dante uspostavlja te je, ako ništa, dosljedan).Rijetko ko se može pohvaliti uticajem na književnost kao ovaj nosati gospodin, a što je apsolutno zasluženo s obzirom na složenost ovog djela u koje je upleten čitav Danteov život, kompletna klasična antička biblioteka, politika predrenesansne Evrope i Danteovo neprikosnoveno baratanje jezikom čije mogućnosti ispituje do krajnjih granica. Ukratko, limb - najprimamljiviji, pakao - strašan, čistilište - pakao lite, raj - tradicionalno dosadan i naporan.

1051247523	Dante'nin Homeros, Ovidius ve Vergilius gibi yazarların mirasını kusursuz bir şekilde devam ettirdiği "Divine Comedy / İlahi Komedya", yazarın şair olarak tam anlamıyla şov yaptığı bir başyapıt niteliğinde. Zaten yazara yolculuğunda Vergilius'un eşlik etmesi başlı başına referans. Eserin ilk bölümü "Inferno / Cehennem" ile kusursuz bir politik alegoriya imza atan Dante, okuyucuyu sadece Cehennem'in dokuz katına yaptığı yolculuğa ortak etmekle kalmıyor aynı zamanda Platon'dan Brutus'a kadar birçok ünlü kişiyi de bu yolculuğa ortak ederek eğlenceli bir destan okuyucuya sunuyor. Dante'nin özellikle Cehennem'in son katmanlarında İslam peygamberiyle karşılaştığı bölümün fazlasıyla dikkat çekici olduğunu belirtmeliyim. Okudukça hayran kaldığınız eserin eleştiri odağındaki yer ise Dante'nin memleketi Floransa. Bu yüzden, İtalyan tarihini ilgilendiren bazı yerlerde dikkatiniz ister istemeden dağılabiliyor. Buna rağmen, anlatmak istediğini eksiksiz biçimde okuyucuya anlatan kitap, bir sonraki bölüm olan "Araf" için sabırsızlanmanıza neden oluyor."Kitabı Mukaddes" göndermelerinin iyice ağırlaştığı "İlahi Komedya"nın ikinci bölümü "Purgatori / Araf", "Cehennem"in bir tık altında da olsa Dante'nin ilk bölümdeki şovuna devam ettiği bir eser olarak göze çarpıyor. Yazarın aynı "Cehennem"de olduğu gibi "Araf"ın da seviyelerini dolaştığı eserde bu sefer yedi ölümcül günahtan (Kibir, Açgözlülük, Şehvet düşkünlüğü, Kıskançlık, Oburluk, Öfke ve Tembellik) arınma sürecindekilerin çektiklerini okuma şansı buluyoruz. Bunu yaparken başta Floransa olmak üzere tüm Avrupa'yı acımasızca eleştiren Dante'nin ana hedefinde ise yozlaşan kilise bulunuyor. Platon, Homeros ve Julius Caesar gibi ünlü tarihi kişilikleri barındıran "Cehennem"e kıyasla daha az ünlü isim barındıran "Araf"ta daha çok zamanının Avrupa tarihini ilgilendiren kişilerine göndermeler yapılıyor. Bu yüzden, ikinci bölümü okurken ilk bölümdeki keyfi yer yer alamıyorsunuz. Buna rağmen, özellikle mükemmel ötesi betimlemeleri ve harika metaforlarıyla kendine bir kere daha hayran bırakan Dante, uzun hissedilen "Araf"ın ardından aynı kendi gibi sizin de "Cennet"i dört gözle beklemenize neden oluyor. Eleştiri oklarını Papalık Devleti'nin dini sömüren yönetim şekline çeken "İlahi Komedya"nın son bölümü "Paradiso / Cennet", Dante'nin "Laiklik" düşüncesini ön plana çıkararak yazarın Tanrı'ya ulaşma yolculuğundaki son kısmı okuyucuyla buluşturuyor. Yazarın kendine hayran bırakan dili ve tanımlamalarını okumaya devam ettiğimiz eserin alt metninde ise sevgi var. Zaten Dante'nin Cennet'in dokuz atmosferinde dolaştığı eserde bu sefer ona eşlik eden kişi de "Araf"ın sonunda ortaya çıkan birici aşkı Beatrice'in ruhu. Tanrı'ya yaklaştıkça Beatrice'e olan aşkı kusursuzluğa erişen yazarın Tanrı'yı ışık olarak resmederek "bilim"i tercih etmesine özellikle dikkat edilmesi gerekiyor. Öte yandan, ağır eleştirileri ve din ile ilgili modern düşünceleri nedeniyle ülkesinden sürülen; ama buna rağmen yazmaya devam eden Dante'nin dini ve politik öğeleri bu kadar kullanmasının nedeni kuşkusuz zamanının İtalya'sından kaynaklanıyor. Bu yüzden, okumanın "Cehennem"e göre daha zorlaştığı eseri okurken "Cehennem"in neden diğer iki bölümden daha iyi ve daha çok okunduğunu olduğunu rahatlıkla anlayabiliyorsunuz. Buna rağmen, yazarın zamanının İtalya'sıyla ilgili verdiği bilgiler gerçekten takdire şayan. Özetlemek gerekirse; "Kitabı Mukaddes" ve Erken ve Yüksek Dönem Orta Çağı İtalya'sı göndermelerinin ağır bir şekilde yer aldığı "İlahi Komedya", insanlığa armağan niteliğinde bir başyapıt. 25.09.2016İstanbul, TürkiyeAlp Turguthttp://www.filmdoktoru.com/kitap-labo...
7005114174	After a couple of hours listening to the Audible version of this work, which was basically a biography and a synopsis of the three volumes and summaries of all the Cantos I can start reading the actual words while listening to the audio. It helps with the pronunciations. Also the audio is theatrically presented with sound effects.I could keep reading this over and over again. This is quite the poem...journey thru Hell, Purgatory and ending in Paradise. I do wonder how Dante became inspired to write this work.
