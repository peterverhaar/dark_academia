5915478671	You know, sometimes when you finish a book, you feel like the earth moves beneath your feet. You keep feeling shaken to your core, your head spinning, and your eyes filled with tears. When you try to put your feelings into words, you find yourself choked up, your voice cracking, unable to express the profound impact the author has had on you. That’s how powerful this author’s work is, and that’s how deeply affected you are by the brilliance of their literature. This book is undoubtedly one of those exceptional reads.I had read comments about this dark academia novel that would captivate numerous readers, plunging them into a thrilling, earth-shattering, and profoundly thought-provoking story set in Dublin’s most exclusive private school, Highfield Manor. Don’t be deceived by the tall granite pillars, the overflow of lilac at the front gate, the immaculate playing fields, the cheerful students, or the dusty, oak-lined library of the manor. Appearances are always deceiving, and nothing is as it seems. Dark, hidden secrets around the poolside may be exposed, altering the lives of the young female athletes.Louise Manson is a new scholarship student at the manor, an outsider with a working-class background among privileged and wealthy students who have given her the cold shoulder since her first day at the academy. Unlike Shauna, who can brighten her day with her genuine smile.Louise harbors a secret agenda related to her best friend, Tina, a highly accomplished swimmer at the academy who took her own life after a troubling incident with a teacher. Louise believes her friend was pregnant before she died and was abused by one of the teachers. She is determined to seek justice for her friend, even if it means putting herself at risk against the most dangerous predator.The story alternates between Louise’s past at the manor, which culminated in a tragic event that changed her life, and the present, where she is happily married, working as a literature instructor in college, and raising her troubled teenage daughter, who keeps secrets of her own. When Shauna’s brother, Ronan Power, connects her to testify in another abuse case related to the manor, she fears that the past she has hidden may resurface and ruin everything she has worked for. She struggles to connect with Shauna, who holds the key to the truth about the fateful night that haunts Louise’s nightmares.Will she face the consequences of revealing her past to protect students from another dangerous predator?This is an intense, thought-provoking, and dark read, addressing feminism, #MeToo empowerment, abuse, mental health, class disparities, and the dangers that lurk in everyday life from a young woman’s perspective. It left me breathless. Some chapters are difficult to digest, but the honest, brutally honest writing, well-developed characters, and intriguing mystery will keep you engaged from start to finish. I wholeheartedly give it five stars and eagerly anticipate future works by this author.I would like to extend my sincere thanks to NetGalley and Flatiron Books for providing me with a digital reviewer copy of this thrilling read in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter<
6296010726	I think I'm going with 2.75 stars for now. ╰┈➤ 𝓠𝓾𝓲𝓬𝓴 𝓢𝓾𝓶𝓶𝓪𝓻𝔂In the late 80's our FMC Lou gets a scholarship to attend a very prestigious all girls school in a posh area of Ireland, Highfield Manor.At first she finds herself having difficulty fitting in but it quickly turns around for her as she befriends the most popular girl in school and in town, Shauna, as she's from one of the most prominent families in the area- as well as the star swimmer in a town where swimming is one of the most prolific sports.Quickly, Lou starts going to work on trying to find out information on the well known swimming coach at Highfield, who she believes is the reason her best friend committed suicide. Lou believes her friend was pregnant before she died and was abused by one of the teachers. She is determined to seek justice for her friend, even if it means putting herself at risk against the most dangerous predator.In the present time, Lou is now married with a young teenage girl who she is struggling to connect with. Shauna's brother contacts her about a case that has found it's way to his desk that is related to another teacher at Highfield and needs her help to provide a statement or worst case, testify.Lou struggles with how to deal with this - all of the dark secrets long buried in her past coming to light which no one in her present life is privy to. Along with wanting to reconnect with Shauna again to get all of the answers to the night that has been haunting her nightmares for 20 years. ╰┈➤ 𝓜𝔂 𝓣𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓰𝓱𝓽𝓼What can I really say? This started so good but at around 50% I kept wanting the timeline to revert back to the past. The present timeline was a slog and I found it boring with just breadcrumbs when it came to details connecting the story. I had to really push myself through those chapters, and the way that the author has written it- the past is a huge chunk of chapters and so is the present. It's not alternating every chapter or every other.The past part of the story is very atmospheric and haunting. I ate those chapters up. I loved the story coming from a dark academia/mystery/thriller aspect as well as the characters from that timeline. I love a good mysterious story at an all girls prestigious private school.╰┈➤˗ˏˋ Ultimately, I lost interest and had to force myself through about 40% of the book. I also found the ending really underwhelming.🖤 Many thanks to NetGalley, Flatiron Books, and Fiona McPhillips for my complementary digital copy in exchange for an honest review. 🖤
5944816075	The novel starts in the present day with Louise Manson remaining forever haunted by her memories of her time at the exclusive Highfield Manor School in Dublin. She has buried secrets, lived with half-truths, which she has tried so hard to suppress over the years. However, it’s happened again, there’s a lawsuit and a lawyer wants her testimony, a corroboration, focusing on her friendship with Shauna Power in the 1980s. Lou‘s head pounds as her memories take her back to the 6th of December 1986, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The story alternates between her time at Highfield Manor, and in the present day where she’s tried to build a happy life from the ashes of the of the past, Then, in 1986, she is the sixth form scholarship girl, an outsider, an outcast amongst the elite and the entitled. However, Lou has an agenda, and a deep-seated reason to be there…… Oh my word – what a book. It really packs a punch and makes you feel something as it’s so well written and powerful. It’s dark that’s for sure and very intense throughout most of the book as it not only encompasses the trauma and impact of the abuse of #MeToo but it also looks at mental health as well as class divisions. It’s a gripping rollercoaster emotional read with revenge at its core. The novel unsettles me from the beginning, there are characters, one especially, that gives you the creeps, making your flesh crawl. There’s toxicity in the 1980s in several areas and also in the present day, though that comes principally from social media. Both timelines demonstrate just how hard it is to get justice with the unfairness breaking your heart with the victim blaming, lack of belief or of ranks closing. There are so many lies. It’s almost hard to keep track of them all. However, there are some lovely moments too especially the friendships and the deep love.In addition, the author really captures the 1980s in a multitude of ways, such as through the music and television, giving excellent context to the storytelling.The novel builds, situations escalate, it’s totally immersive and a very hard book to set aside as I become desperate to know the outcome and what Lou and the others will do. The twists keep on coming, parts of the ending makes you gasp in shock and the rest makes you sigh in relief.Overall, what an amazing debut. Fiona McPhillips is clearly very talented as the strength of her prose demonstrates. Despite the fact she’s telling a tough story, she does so very sensitively . This is a terrific book in my opinion.With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Random House UK, Transworld for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.
6354645008	A thriller told in two timelines, this tale is made better on audio due to the narrator's lilting Irish accent. While thrillers are hit or miss for me, this one leans toward Irish noir and crime procedurals, which I enjoy just a bit more. While I unabashedly love Nordic noir, as someone that grew up in the strict confines of Catholicism, there is something about books set in modern day Ireland that hit different than other Catholic majority countries, e.g. France, Portugal, or even Spain.In the past, Lou attends Highfield Manor, a very exclusive private school. The swim team, along with the entire school, has many secrets to keep. Keep these secrets in mind. They still play out in the modern day storyline.Decades later, the crime that occurred at Highfield still has yet to see the light of day. Although accusations were made, and fingers pointed, no one was ever convicted. Lou deigns to change this. As she sifts through her waning memories of that night, she begins to reach out to former classmates and enemies in order to get their testimonies straight.While I wasn't shocked, and that's fine, as I hate the genre "twists" that occur out of nowhere nowadays, I will say I am pleased with the outcome. Exploitation and privilege occur everywhere, but there is just something more sinister when it deals with underage schoolgirls and the ever looming backdrop of Catholicism.🎧 Thank you to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio
7331383042	Not for me too many triggers I don’t care 🤷‍♀️ for a prestigious private school hold secrets that it doesn’t want revealed this trope has been done ✅ time & time again.This book has differing reviews but this was not for me.
6387273251	Thank you to Flatiron Books and Netgalley @Netgalley for this e-arc. All thoughts are my own. Lou has rebuilt her life after the events that occurred in high school nearly ruined her. So when she gets a phone call from her old best friends lawyer to testify, she is worried. When she was in high school, she thought the dead body would end her. But now she has a daughter to protect, and she has to move past what happened. This is a hard book to review, because it deals with very important and tough topics, but it was a hard book for me to read, and not because of the topic. I found the writing hard for me to get into and horribly slow. I found my mind drifting, and I had trouble focusing on the story. When the story was focused on the present, I found myself getting frustrated because it didn’t have a clear point. I also found the twists to be lacking and fairly predictable. I think that had the pacing been faster I would have been able to get into the story more, and enjoyed it. I do think that this book has an important message, and it one that needs to be told, I just struggled.
6328014348	WHAT A BOOK! Be forewarned, this book covers some very heavy topics. However, I think it is so important that these things are discussed. I was so impressed with how this was written. It didn't have the perfect cookie-cutter ending I was secretly hoping for, but that just made it all the more realistic. The emotions, the courage, the fight for justice...I was so moved by all of it. I will recommend this book to absolutely everyone.
6173255912	I listened to the audiobook for this one and the narrator did an amazing job bringing the characters to life. I liked this book a lot, but I didn’t find it to be much of a mystery or thriller, I found it to be an emotional train wreck with some coming of age and a whole lot of trauma. I came close to or shed tears multiple times and I have to say it was hard to listen to at times because the realistic way it was told was so easy to believe and it was infuriating the systemic abuse. There should be huge trigger warnings for this one for sexual abuse (of minors by adults), alcoholism, and suicide. Lou lives on the wrong side of town, but after her best friend commits suicide she decides to go to the prep school her friend had attended. Some of the girls befriend her but when she tries to bring some of the dark secrets of the school to light they all turn on her. This book is told in two timelines which goes to show that the trauma you survive never totally leaves you as it’s still haunting Lou more than two decades later. This was a powerful book, a wonderful book, but go into expecting a punch to the emotions more than a thriller.
6446961876	When We Were Silent by Fiona McPhillips is a thriller novel that deals with a tough topic that may be a trigger to some. The story in When We Were Silent is one that is told in a dual timeline fashion with the present and from thirty years before.Louise Manson is happily married, works at a college and is raising a teenage daughter. When Louise is contacted by a lawyer asking her to testify in another case of abuse she is thrown back in the past to remembering the trauma that she went through thirty years ago and is worried those past secrets will come surfacing into her present.Thirty years ago Louise became the new girl at Highfield Manor, an elite private school in Dublin. Louise had gotten a scholarship but had an agenda in attending the institute and that was to defend her friend’s memory and bring a shocking secret at the school to light putting herself at risk of being the next victim.Looking around at other’s thoughts when finishing When We Were Silent by Fiona McPhillips I see that this one falls into the case of being an outlier in my feelings for this one. Most folks seemed to have loved When We Were Silent but for me I just felt this one didn’t draw me in at all and with the tough topics I found myself rolling my eyes a few times as it seemed for lack of a better way of describing it a bit over the top to me and for the most part a lot of the book just seemed to be dragging on to me. At the end I just thought this was underwhelming to me overall and rated it at two and a half stars but while it wasn’t my cup of tea others do seem to be enjoying it.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/
6573854079	This book has good intentions in its scathing indictment of the systems that enable sexual abuse, but the execution is muddled. Character motivations are unclear, pacing is uneven, details are withheld for shock value that are easily discernible, and certain plot points stretch credulity. Ultimately this just has a lot of common pitfalls of a debut novel, so I can’t fault it too harshly, but my petty annoyances kept adding up to the point where they were clouding the reading experience.
6330926476	I started this book, read about halfway through and set it back down several months ago. I was not wanting anything this dark for summer reading. Now that we’re headed into fall I am so glad I picked it back up. This was just WOW. What an intense book. It packed quite a powerful punch but I want to give everyone a heads up that there are ⚠️triggers of trauma and abuse that were difficult to read about. This is dark and does go there.Fiona McPhillips is masterful at foolery as appearances are very deceiving in this. With insights into predatory behavior, morales, mental health.. secret agenda’s and revenge.. you think it’s all cut and dry, that you have it all figured out.. but nothing is as it seems here, and IS NOT your typical academic mystery-thriller. That’s one of the things I liked most about this book, it kept me on my toes and chomping at the bit to find out how it would end. I still can’t believe this is a debut. If you have a sweet spot for dark academia (again, this does have trigger warnings) pick this up to satisfy that craving. 4.5 stars — Pub. 5/21/24
6356468549	Dark academia is so hit or miss with me, but I was really excited to read Fiona McPhillips' upcoming release, WHEN WE WERE SILENT. I mean, look at this cover alone!! The story focuses on Louise (Lou) Manson at her new school, Highfield Manor. Lou comes from a working-class background, which makes her feeling distant from her other, upper class peers. However, (without going into details) Lou has secrets of her own that could affect the prestige of Highfield Manor, specifically secrets that could bring everything crashing down.This is a mini review, but I had fun with this book, even though it wasn't very unique for a book in the #MeToo era. It's a bit slow and took awhile for me to really get invested. I listened to the audio and the narrator was hauntingly telling the story, so I think that helped me going. If you liked My Dark Vanessa and enjoy Irish mysteries, WHEN WE WERE SILENT will be a winner for you!
6448744993	This book was HEAVY. But, such a fantastic read. Dark academia is honestly my favorite lately - and boy. This was dark. It was so frustrating reading about what was happening and no one of authority would listen. It was really eye opening. This was so well written, the short chapters and the past and present timelines had me completely hooked. Add this to your tbr! TW: assault, r@pe
6486877414	امسال تا اینجا، سال ناامیدی از کتابا بوده.من انتظار خیلی بالایی از این کتاب داشتم و فکر میکردم به خاطر موضوع مهمش و لوکیشنش که معمولا کتابای خیلی جالبی توش نوشته میشه قراره خیلی خوب باشه. نمیگم بد بود چون اصلا بد نبود. هنوزم میتونم بگم موضوعی که تمرکز روش بود موضوع مهمی بود و خوب هم بهش پرداخته شده بود. شخصیت اصلی، شخصیت دوست داشتنی‌ای بود و به یه سری مشکلات مهم پرداخته شده بود ولی پلات اصلی به جالبی‌ای که باید نبود. خیلی جاها حوصلم سر رفت و فقط میخوندمش که بتونم برسم به تهش و تیک بزنم و بگم خب این کتابو خوندم. و واسه این ژانر...همین به نظرم کافیه برای اینکه کتاب خوب نباشه. واقعا دلم برای خوندن تریلرهای خوب تنگ شده و امیدوار بودم این کتاب اون حس جذاب تریلر توی مدرسه رو بده ولی ناامیدم کرد:)
6492995779	This is a debut dark academia thriller and it is definitely DARK. Lots of triggers in this one. This one grabbed me from the start. It was suspenseful, gripping and mysterious. Louise, who is from a blue collar family, and is enrolled at an elite High School in Ireland, Highfield Manor. Louise has secrets of things that went on at this school. Then her friend Tina commits suicide after an incident with a teacher. Loose is ready and willing to expose what went down. The story alternates from the past, at the school , to present, where Louise is married and dealing with her troubled teenage daughter. She is contacted by an attorney who wants her to help him and tell her story. But can she rehash the past to help future students?! This book was haunting and important. Dealing with the #MeToo movement, it's emotional, heartbreaking and well developed. A really great debut novel that I'd definitely recommend! Thank you to the publisher for the gifted copy in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
6520409556	This book deals with very important, yet difficult, topics and subjects, and I recommend every read or listen to this one. It's a story that needs to be told. With that being said, it is difficult to review this one, not because of the subject matter. It was difficult to relate to the writing. This book was very slow to me. I wish the pacing would've been faster, which may have been accomplished by leaving out parts of the present story. I predicted most of the twists, and found my mind drifting while listening, which never happens for me. I did have to rewind multiple times to catch what I missed while my mind was drifting. The narrator did a great job bringing the emotions to life and differentiating between characters with different voices. This is such an important story, but sadly, this wasn't the book for me.Thank you to MacMillan Audio & NetGalley for the ALC. All opinions are my own.
5930174762	Whilst in parts this book was a hard read due to the sensitivity of the story, it was truly gripping and I couldn’t put it down. Lou starts her final year at Highfield Manor, where she has gone to get revenge to expose a deep secret. I’d highly recommend this book, it’s honestly an amazing read
6444078829	Man was this was a heavy one. When We Were Silent is a dark story that had me holding my breath a lot of the time.As a whole, it’s an emotional coming-of-age story that was a traumatic train wreck for the characters. Told in dual timelines, as I read, I found myself not only experiencing the trauma as it happens, but also the effects 30 years later. Those future effects were huge, and I appreciated how the author brought the reality of being a survivor and still dealing with past traumas to life.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁:Dark Academia Dual Timelines Hidden PastMental HealthAbuseFeminism MeToo Not so much a thriller as noir𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗼𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸?I really enjoyed how India Mullen brought this dark and atmospheric story to life.

You will also want to check the trigger warnings for this book.Thank you, Flat Iron for this gifted copy in exchange for my honest opinions.
6539595354	Not anything specifically terrible about it, but I feel like we’ve read versions of this so many times before, and there’s not enough outstanding writing or characters to differentiate it from other books. Also very much not a thriller (mostly drama and a lot more court case than expected), if you thought so as I did, but nevertheless, still predictable and lacking in tension. And since it’s not a thriller, I think this is even less satisfying in what it sets out to achieve. It takes awhile for the MC to catch on to a number of things that seem a bit obvious, too. Meh. Considering the subject of the central issue, I should have felt a lot more than I did. 2.5 starsAudio Notes: I liked the narrator’s Irish accents and her delivery, though. I nearly DNFd multiple times and it’s thanks to her that I kept going.
6521129633	Thank you to Macmillan Audio for the ALC to review.I thought the narrator did a wonderful job with this one, and overall I liked it. It started off strong but went a little long for me and the dual timelines were a bit hard to follow solely via audio, so I do recommend having a physical copy when reading this one. I thought the tough subjects in here were covered well, and for that alone it is worth the read, I just think this gets lost a bit in trying to wrap it all up and could have been a bit more crisp. It is a debut novel and I'm looking forward to seeing what McPhillips writes next.
6387673232	In When We Were Silent (published yesterday), Fiona McPhillips has written a barnstorming novel about secrets, lies, privilege and the vile abuse of power by a swimming coach at a private Catholic school in Dublin.What makes the book so compelling and interesting isn't just the excellent writing and gripping plot, but the fact that so much of what McPhillips writes about is mirrored in Irish society.Many of you will be familiar with Derry O'Rourke, George Gibney and Frank McCann, Irish swimming coaches who groomed and abused teenage girls in the 1980s, the latter conceiving a child with one of them and hiding it from his wife and daughter by murdering them in their own home. O'Rourke served time for his crimes. George Gibney was indicted on 27 counts of abuse but charges were dropped following a controversial ruling by the Supreme Court and he left for the US where he continues to be protected by the Catholic Church.Combine the rampant sexual abuse in Irish swimming with the prolific sexual abuse by members of the clergy of the Catholic Church in Irish private day and boarding schools (Blackrock College, Belvedere College, Castleknock College to name but a few) and the State inquiry into that abuse, and you have all the ingredients of an explosive story which McPhillips has fictionalised.It's Dublin in the 1980s and Lou Manson is a working-class girl on a scholarship to Highfield Manor, a posh, Catholic all-girls boarding school in South Dublin. Her best friend Tina recently took her own life following a confession to Lou that Tina had been sexually abused by the swimming coach McQueen at Highfield. Determined to get to the truth of what happened to Tina, Lou sets out to entrap McQueen but faces more than she bargained for. Fast forward to the present, when a new scandal concerning Highfield is about to emerge and Lou feels justice was never served. Can she bring about the truth this time?I was completely absorbed in this book from the beginning. McPhillips captures the zeitgeist of the 1980s very well, with music and cultural references from the time. The picture she paints of privilege and the discomfort that abuse causes in those who revere the schools they were educated in is noteworthy - it's as though the legacy of the school is more important than exposing the crimes that destroyed so many of those who passed through it. I think that's a notion that persists to this day in how we as a society have failed to confront some of these truths head-on.Only one small issue with the plot for me - McQueen was so slippery that I felt he probably would have been at Tina's funeral and would have heard Lou mouthing off as we are told she did, and so would have been more cautious about targeting her I think, although having said that perhaps the arrogance and narcissism of the man meant he knew he was invincible.Excellent thriller that I would highly recommend. Irish book clubs will love this one. 4/5 ⭐️ *Thanks to @penguinrandomhouse Transworld Publishers for the arc via @netgalley in exchange for an honest review.
5491871384	What a powerful and important book. I could not stop listening to this beautifully narrated audiobook, despite the heavy subject matter. It was wonderfully written with incredible prose, the details so vividly drawn I felt like I was there. Lou was a heartbreaking protagonist whose side I was on the entire time. The relationship between Lou and Shauna is at the core of this story and I love the tenderness and realness of it. An amazing book that deserves all the awards!
6597510647	Audiobook Rating: 5/5If looking at the average on Goodreads is anything to go by, I am not in the minority when it comes to my experience with When We Were Silent by Fiona McPhillips. However, I do seem to be in the minority among my friends. So, I will just preface my review by saying I am not going to say I recommend this to everyone, but I am sure it will be for lots of readers, so don't let my review deter you. I thought the idea for the book was fantastic with Louise facing her past at the school and everything that happened there, but then things get messy. I understand that this is a debut novel, but the timelines were incredibly confusing, and I found it almost impossible at times to know if I was reading in the current or past timeline. There were also times when the author would jump ahead without any preamble, and it made me wonder where the time went. The bright side to my experience came from the audiobook and I loved India Mullen's performance for Lou. She was easy to understand even at the higher speed I listened at, and she did an incredible job bringing the character to life along with all of the emotions she experienced throughout the story. This is a fairly heavy read, but it brought up some important things and would make a great book club pick. When We Were Silent had some pretty wild shock value at the end and while some people can figure out what's coming, I did not, and my jaw almost hit the floor. The premise was there even though the execution was lacking, and I would definitely give McPhillips another chance.
7798322940	Very difficult but well written book. About Irish high school age and college age girls who were attacked and raped by coaches.Looks like this are important on one hand, but very difficult on the other.I recommend with caution.
6181581741	A gut punch of a story with some very heavy topics to deal with! Thank you to Netgalley and Macmillan Audio for the advanced audio copy to review. This was an amazing debut, wonderfully written, and wholly transported me back to the 80s in the plunges into the past. I do love a dual timeline book. Lou, our main character, has dealt with a lot of trauma and she is still dealing with it so many years later. She is asked to testify in a sexual abuse case which dredges up the past and so many memories while she was on scholarship at an elite private school. Her best friend used to attend the school had taken her own life and Lou could never really quite grasp why. There were several parts of this audiobook where I just gasped or covered my mouth while listening. It really does grab you and shake you up. Fiona McPhillips thank you for this stunning book.
6195504868	I was privileged to read an ARC of When We Were Silent, and thoroughly enjoyed it. McPhillips deals with difficult subject matter in an unflinching but conscientious way. There are some dark academia vibes, and some badass women. So good. Highly recommended.
6484965983	Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with an eARC of this novel!This one was a very difficult read at times, as it tackles the very heavy and upsetting topics of grooming, sexual abuse, religious abuse, suicide, and others, as a woman is pulled back into her past when she is approached to testify in a lawsuit at the high school that covered up her own sexual abuse (as well asthe abuse of many other girls) at the hands of a popular swim coach. I found WHEN WE WERE SILENT to be harrowing, heartbreaking, rage filled, and hopeful, and I think that McPhillips does a great job of telling both stories of the past and the present while calling out the all too real way that powerful institutions will hide abusers to keep their power in place. I would advise readers to approach this one with caution, as there are many moments that are very disturbing to read and could be triggering for some, but it's also a necessary story because some things never change. I highly recommend this one and it's an impressive debut.
6051886702	This was gripping and so, so dark. Taking a star off because there were a few moments that felt unbelievable enough to rip me out of the story, but overall a good page turner that I would recommend for fans of “I have some questions for you.”
6354751200	Three decades after “The Highfield Affair” occurred in an exclusive private school in Dublin, Lou faces her secrets again as new allegations are being made by a student against a teacher. The atmosphere in this debut novel is beautifully written. It’s dark academia at its best and the #MeToo story of empowerment is told with sensitivity and respect. The layers of protection that surround a predator through their manipulation are astounding and even some of the students and victims feel they need to look the other way. I thought this was expressed really well here. A person in a place of power that chooses to abuse, can get away with it for a long time until someone is willing to expose them and usually at their own peril. Stepping forward is difficult today, and in the 80’s when women were encouraged to enjoy and flaunt their sexuality, the lines of consent and grooming/rape were blurred. I loved the narration by India Mullen. Her beautiful Irish accent and voice brought authenticity to the story and I know I enjoyed the novel even more than I would have if I read it in print. @indiamullenThank you to @fiona.mcp @macmillan.audio @netgalley for an advance listening copy. I felt it was thought provoking and brilliant. I give When We Were Silent my highest recommendation and I’m looking forward to the author’s next book.
6561195438	Louise Manson, a kid from the poor side of town, has arrived at Highfield Manor seemingly as a scholarship student but has a hidden agenda as well. Her outsider status allows affluent students to ridicule her under the eyes of several Catholic nuns who don’t believe that the likes of Louise should sully the halls of their hallowed institution. But two things happen: wealthy, beautiful Shauna Powers befriends Louise and Louise shows prowess at hockey that allows her to join the team. But as Louise’s agenda begins to unfold so do events out of her control forcing Louise to fight for her life.In a separate timeline, we join Louise some thirty years late, married and with a teenager, when she is approached by Ronan Powers, Shauna’s younger, always disapproving younger brother, to be a witness in an abuse case against Highfield Manor. Although the years have distanced Louise from the nightmarish occurrences at Highfield, she has never forgotten. Can she risk everything she has now to finally put an end to the events of the past in Fiona McPhillips’ charged debut When We Were Silent.So many novels that I’ve read in the past few years have dealt with abuse. While it’s a hot topic, the discussions and notoriety don’t seem to be impacting cases against wealthy men/men in power the way you would think they should; the contents of When We Were Silent should bring about some dialogue regarding abuse and Catholicism, but I’m going to leave that to someone else. But this novel does celebrate advances toward women’s empowerment.When We Were Silent is an excellently written debut by Fiona McPhillips but I don’t think it benefitted from the timeline leaps between school age Louise and 40-something Louise. While many novels employ the technique of alternating between the past and the present, sometimes it becomes apparent that a more linear approach might be better.I felt more invested in Louise’s early timeline than I did in her present timeline for the main fact that the early one seemed to have been planned better than the current. We come to know the players in the earlier one far better than we know the ones in the later so to give them equal footing didn’t enhance the story. I wanted to know about Louise’s intervening years, about her daughter, her wife Alex, Joe (who is the only good man in the entire novel) and her mother, but only tidbit snacks are tossed to us. Unfortunately.On the other hand, I was intrigued/fascinated by Louise’s time at Highfield. In these passages, emotions run high but not totally from angst but from the evolving situations that turn on Louise, that show just how little power someone like her has against powerful men and institutions. Her impotence in these situations makes you feel sick so, well-done, McPhillips for making these scenes so very palpable.I found the pacing to be slow. Because I listened to the novel, I was surprised to discover that it was 308 pages and not longer. It felt longer. Something about India Mullen’s narration felt a bit soporific (aka I almost dozed off twice) but I didn’t think it was bad in any way. Maybe too soothing for me when I was listening at the end of the day.I am excited to see what Fiona McPhillips’ gives us in the future.Many thanks to Macmillan Audio for sending me a copy.
6259638203	When Louise becomes the newest student at Highfield Manor, an elite private school, she feels like a fish out of water. Being from a lower class, she’s immediately seen as an outsider and when she starts digging into the school’s secrets, she finds there are much higher powers at play. Thirty years later, Lou is contacted by a lawyer wanting her to testify against the same school in a big case - will she confront her past and find out what really happened all of those years ago?WHEN WE WERE SILENT by Fiona McPhillips is such a strong, powerful debut suspense.This book has the darkness and snark of an Irish novel, which I loved, and the fish-out-of-water private school setting was done so well!I enjoyed the alternating timelines and seeing everything slot in place - this is one of those stories where, as a reader, you find yourself yearning and needing some justice and that feeling really helped build the suspense.Highly intrigued by what McPhillips cooks up next!Thanks to Flatiron Books for an ARC in exchange for an honest review!Publication Date: May 21**tw: rape, grooming
6592847902	When We Were Silent is the debut novel from Irish journalist and screenwriter Fiona McPhillips. The novel is an explosive and compelling story about grooming and sexual abuse in Irish swimming circles, and I couldn't put it down.Lou Manson joined Highfield Manor, a private Catholic all-girls school in south Dublin, in her final year. She is a working-class teenager from a single-parent household, and she's on a scholarship, so she stands out like a sore thumb. But Lou isn't concerned with status; she's at Highfield to seek revenge for the tragic death of her best friend Tina, who died by suicide after suffering long-term sexual abuse at the hands of her swimming coach, Maurice McQueen. Lou is desperate to expose McQueen, but his reputation proves above reproach.Present day, thirty years later, Lou is contacted by a high profile solicitor who is representing another student at Highfield who claims he is being sexually abused by his swimming coach. Testifying will mean revisiting her past, which Lou is reluctant to do now that she has a young daughter to protect, but she is also desperate for retribution.When We Were Silent is a fictionalised story, but McPhillips has no doubt been inspired by Ireland's history of sexual abuse in swimming, most notably the Olympic coach George Gibney, who many of you will have come across in the BBC podcast Where is George Gibney. It's also no coincidence that Highfield Manor is a private school under the control of the Catholic Church, which echoes the relatively recent State enquiries into sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in Irish private schools.This is a sharp and gripping novel. The characters were really well drawn, especially Lou, and I loved the dual timelines and the tension evoked in both. The writing is compelling, it's excellently plotted, and McPhillips depiction of 1980s Ireland and the behaviours and motivations of teenagers is both accurate and engaging. It's ambitious in its exploration of power, privilege, institutional negligence, and Ireland's national shame, but McPhillips does a masterful job of emphasising the importance of confronting our history and bringing injustices into the light.“In the end, we’re the ones who have to live with the stories we tell.”
6007750672	A dark academia mystery set in Ireland (and by an Irish author so you can't go wrong). We follow Louise with two timelines, one in the past when she attended an elite high school in Ireland and one set 30 years later in the present.I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone talk about this book on social media. I was hooked from the very beginning and could not put this down! For fans of books like My Last Innocent Year and obviously all the dark academia fans! I do wish we had gotten a little more for the ending, but overall very impressive for a debut! TW: suicide and sexual assault/abuse
6348656286	Louise was a student at Highfield Manor, a private school in Dublin, when tragic events occurred. 30 years later Louise is contacted by a high profile lawyer to testify against the school in a lawsuit involving a current student resulting in her confronting demons from her past that she has held back for decades. This story is a fight for justice at an academic institution where silence is valued above all else and this involves a multitude of sexual abuses covered up for decades. This tale is darkly intense and secrets and lies are involved among many characters so the plot is intricate and complex. There are mysteries to resolve in two timelines so it is not a quick read as the shattering truths are slowly revealed. Fiona McPhillips has written an impressive debut novel and I look forward to her next work.
7864437281	4.5 starsI'm seriously impressed that this was a debut novel. The writing was nuanced and layered with emotion. I could feel the fear, betrayal, anger, and hopelessness that the characters experienced. I also appreciated the realistic and engaging dialogue. The author was able to capture the emotional atmosphere during these conversations. It pulled me further into the story.Although the subject matter was heavy - sexual abuse - the plot depicted what I found to be a well developed and accurate representation of how it happens, the impact it has on victims and the systems that keep it in place by turning a blind eye. The audio performance was engaging and well suited for the main character.Thank you #NetGalley for a superb audiobook in exchange for an honest review.
8021966056	only read this for the goodreads fall challenge and while i usually HATE dark academia at this point, this was incredibly well written and thoughtful. i loved it!
6228932418	“I’m not here for prestige. I’m here for revenge.”Louise Manson is an outsider when she joins the final-year class at Highfield Manor, Dublin’s most exclusive private school. Beyond the granite pillars and the wrought-iron gates is a world of wealth, privilege and potential. But Highfield is also hiding a dark secret, and she is here to expose it. The problem? Why would anyone believe her, a girl from a Ballybrack estate, when the other elite students are keeping schtum?The contrast between Lou’s working-class background couldn’t be more different to the affluence of most other Highfield students, and it helps set the scene for a gripping tale of exploitation and retribution.Not only does Lou have to contend with cliquey students and an unstable family life, but she is carrying a vast amount of guilt and grief over the loss of her friend Tina, a promising athlete, who committed suicide after making allegations against a Highfield teacher.Thirty years later, Lou is encouraged to testify in a new lawsuit against Highfield. But telling the truth means confronting her past and the one story she swore she’d never tell. On top of this, she is struggling with her relationship with her teenage daughter, but is it a valid concern or a consequence of her own past trauma that has her anxiety soaring?When We Were Silent tells Lou’s gripping story over a dual timeline; every page oozes drama, a claustrophobic web of loyalties, lies and privilege as long-buried secrets emerge. Despite the gritty, sometimes uncomfortably painful topics, this book is sensitively written and packed with emotion. 4.5⭐Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for the opportunity to read an advance copy; this, as always, is an honest review. When We Were Silent is out in May.

6451231044	Thank you @flatiron_books for my advance copy! This cover is beautiful and haunting. I was unaware while reading this , that it was a debut. I was shocked! It is dark, difficult, frustrating and sad. Taking place in the 80’s and present day, we get a #MeToo style story similar to My Dark Vanessa. I was so angry while reading this at times. I felt for Lou so much and her unfair circumstances. My only gripe with this is that is could have been shaved down a bit. Pretty impressive for a debut!

She soon finds herself in over her head. Can she overcome a system of wealth, power, and coverups?This is an institutional tale, not a popcorn thriller, but the stakes are high, the character well written, and the plot tight, so it kept me turning pages as fast as I would with a lighter read. I think this dealt with a lot of YA topics, though in adult tone so I enjoyed it all the same.Definitely check this out if you like dark academia and underdog stories!📚 Series or Standalone: standalone📚 Genre: thriller 📚 Target Age Group: adult (though I think teens would enjoy it too, given setting)📚 Cliffhanger: no✨ Will I Reread: maybe💕 Characters: 5/5💕 Writing: 5/5💕 Plot: 4/5💕 Pacing: 5/5💕 Unputdownability: 4/5💕 Enjoyment: 4/5💕 Book Cover: 4/5Thanks, NetGalley and Flatiron, for the gifted ARC in exchange for an honest review.
5899255875	This was such a compelling read - it's brave, dark, and thought-provoking, but also paces extremely well and had several twists that completely surprised me. The writing is fantastic, capturing such a specific sense of time and place that you feel transported. The timeline switching between past and present gives depth and context to the serious issues being discussed, and while the book does contain some graphic content, it feels necessary to do these issues justice. And this is nicely balanced between some real love and friendships, moments of joy, and feelings of connection in a world where it feels like the odds are stacked against you.
6552415995	Poorly written. Obvious plot arc. It read like the author had a checklist of provocative subjects and created a story around that sensationalism but didn’t have the writing skills or imagination to pull it off. Did not finish, skipped to the last chapter and was glad I did not invest anymore time in the book. Ugh.
6343496933	"When We Were Silent " by Fiona McPhillips is a very good book about an important topic. I couldn't put it down. I got invested, and I had to listen to it straight through. This book is told in two time periods, the present (approx. 2016) and the past, about 30 years earlier, in 1986. In the past, Louise was in high school in Dublin, Ireland, and got into Highfield Manor, a prestigious private school for her final year. Her best friend, Tina, had died suspiciously the year before, and Louise knew it had to do with the swim coach, McQueen. This book is about sexual predators and tells it from the POV of young women going through it. Some of it is hard to read. Then, when one of them tries to get help.. well, you just have to read it. In the present, have things gotten any better? In the book, not so much.. but the "Me, too" movement has helped.

6361182636	As I listened to the audiobook, I was immediately captivated by a whirlwind of emotions. The story unfolded, revealing a world filled with insecurities and daunting challenges, completely undermining any sense of safety. With each passing chapter, a profound sense of vulnerability stirred within me, compelling me to embark on a quest for truth and justice.I felt caught up in the complex web of morality and the fragility of human existence. Each new revelation exposed hidden truths, stirring up a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions.The narrator's voice breathed life into the characters, making the experience all the more immersive and unforgettable.In my view, this work offers a profound exploration of the human condition, leaving a lasting impression that extends far beyond the final chapter. It's a compelling listen for anyone seeking a deeply affecting literary journey.
6914487884	After learning of terrible cases of sexual abuse of young athletes, such as the Michigan State gymnasts, we can scarcely find anything implausible in fictional accounts of similar crimes. This tale of Coach McQueen's treatment of swimmers and hockey players at a posh Dublin girls' school is totally believable, especially as a coach is often the first important adult person who is not a parent to be a major influence on a teenager. Unfortunately, too likely as well is the response of the nuns who run the school and blame the whistleblower who narrates this novel. Lou is the teenaged daughter of an alcoholic single mother, whose BF committed suicide after being raped and impregnated by her coach. Having myself written a novel with a main character who goes undercover to expose sexual predation, I felt thoroughly involved in the plot. But I found the time frame too big and the cast of characters too numerous to maintain my focus. It is only years later that Lou's story is resolved. But the irony of an Olympic-sized swimming facility being named in honour of a sex criminal is all too likely.
6420004299	A powerful debut novel, detailing the systematic abuse and the failings of those in a position of trust at a top school in Ireland.Lou is thrilled to be awarded a scholarship to Highfields but isn't prepared for the bullying of her fellow students, nor the attention from the esteemed Sports Teacher Mr McQueen.Told in the past and present day this novel delves deep into feelings of teenage girls, decades of secrets and distrust. It's a sensitive matter but dealt with empathetically. I'm grateful to Netgalley and Random House UK for the opportunity to read this advanced copy with no obligation to leave my review
6558579091	4.5 rounded up to 5. (I docked half a star because this was a lengthy book.. some parts really dragged on) but wow, this book had such an impact on me as a woman... as a mother.... I was expecting something so different and was shocked to find out what exactly this book was. I wish there was slightly more character development because I felt slightly disconnected from the characters but at the same time... Was rooting for justice and bravery. I felt such intense feelings most of this book.. and I think everyone should add this one to their TBR stack
6737713180	3 étoiles ⭐️C'était pas mauvais, y'avait une bonne intrigue, mais beaucoup trop de longueurs. Les changements entre avant et maintenant auraient pu être mieux dispersés, c'était long avant de comprendre qu'est-ce ce qui se passait.Je n'ai pas aimé non plus la personnage principale, qui a laissé les autres dicter ses actions pendant trop longtemps 🤦‍♀️
6418616943	Thank you to NetGalley and MacMillan Audio for this ARC. TW: Abuse, Rape, Sexual Assault, Eating Disorders, Alcohol Abuse, Grooming, SuicideThis read was VERY intense and VERY unsettling at times, however very captivating. I was wrapped up in this story until the very end. It touched on many, many heavy topics ; making it not for everyone. Although challenging to read at times, I find it important to read about some of these subjects from time to time as we unfortunately live in world that's not always sunshine and rainbows. The narrator did an excellent job with this book by adding the emotion and expression needed for those very heavy topics. Although I listened to this book, I could still tell how incredibly well written it was. I'd recommend this book to many. Available May 21 20244 stars!
6179434342	3 stars--I liked the book. I liked the segments set in the past better than the ones set in the present; I feel like the MC changed a lot from when she was a teen to an adult. (Yes, I know, trauma, etc., but she lost a lot of her spunk and became a stereotypical "anxious mom.") However, I enjoyed the ending greatly.
6708276646	It is an excellent Irish mystery novel about abuse in a Catholic girls school by the male swim coach.
6470236224	I gobbled this bitch right up! I can’t believe this is a debut, it felt so smooth and well thought out. I definitely felt my anxiety spiking during multiple points of the story, since I have similar life experiences, so def read trigger warnings!
6341773282	You have to be along for the ride to appreciate this one. There is a lot of slow burn, and you have to piece things together from "now" and "then" as you alternate between the timelines. It's a good story, though, with characters realizing the value of the truth.
6980071137	This story deals with an extremely heavy topic. I didn't realise it because the description doesn't give away much of the plot.While I did find the story interesting, it was a bit troubling reading the parts where exploitation is dealt with.
6645174137	“So I do what I’ve done in so many awkward situations, where a man has manoeuvred me into an uncomfortable situation, I go along with it and pray it’ll be ok”
6549542264	This was beyond good. (Trigger warning violent theme) The abuse of children under the care of a coach or teacher is timely and relevant in today’s culture unfortunately. This was hard to read at times, but the writing is phenomenal.
6330327447	Thank you to Flatiron Books for an ARC printed copy. I loved this book and honestly would have finished it in one sitting if I didn't have real world responsibilities to tend to. This book was emotional and well written. I think the switching from present and past was well done. The author would give you just enough to get you asking the questions needed to be answered in the next part. I probably would not have bought this book on my own and it would have sat in a TBR list a mile long. I am SO grateful that the book made it to me through a giveaway because wow... it was a novel I needed. I look forward to any future novels written by Fiona McPhillips.
6406952647	What an impressive achievement this book is for the authors first fiction novel. It’s a total page turner with twists that I did not see coming and albeit an all too familiar story, it is told in a way that feels very authentic and original. I really enjoyed the vividly descriptive language used to describe Dublin, the weather, the sea, the nuns in school. It’s 100% relatable! What leaps from the pages is the power that silence hands to abusers and the injustice of finding the courage to speak and not being believed. Looking forward to the next one!
6210248557	When We Were Silent takes events and wounds from the past and reopens them in the light of the present day. This story is a take on dark academia, in a way, and an unflinching tale of assault, abuses of power, and the unfortunate who get caught in the snares of those who mean to harm. The narrative shifts between present and past, with each part taking place in huge sections rather than swapping every chapter or so. This is good in that it allows you to get invested in a particular timeline, but it also makes it difficult if you prefer one timeline over another, as you get stuck in one world for an extended period. In the past timeline, Lou is enrolled in a private school. Her ulterior motive for this is to find out what happened to cause her friend Tina to end her life. Quickly she gets caught up in the drastic difference between the high-class school and its students and her own life as an outsider from the working class. Sports are a common thread, and quickly Lou learns everything she needs to know about what happened to Tina, but trying to find a way to bring the involved parties to justice takes a bit of a turn as she gets involved with some of her classmates and comes up against the machinery that is the school administration. In the current timeline, Lou is a mother, trying to deal with her young daughter and the lingering effects of the past she had hoped to leave behind. But the past never stays buried. Quickly, her past is thrust back into the spotlight as new allegations surface around her old stomping grounds. Lou has to decide what to do to help current students, finally realize the full truth of what happened to her long ago, and bring everything to a close. There is so much here that is interesting, and even the inherent darkness of the story tries to find some small sliver of light. However, the current timeline felt abrupt and jumpy, and a storyline involving Lou's daughter seemed a bit unnecessary in light of everything else that was going on. Or at least, not fleshed out enough to stand on its own. The original story of Lou's past is the one that was the most riveting, and following the aftermath of that for a longer time may have helped the present day a little better. It is almost as if there were two separate stories here that each deserved its spotlight, rather than sharing a single book. The second half felt abrupt in resolution as Lou finally got answers to exactly what had happened when she was in school all those years ago. And so many of the side characters fell flat and were there to act as foils or sources of information for Lou, with no real agency of their own. I will also note to please check content warnings, as this book deals on page with assault, more than once. It is the basis for the entire book, so please go in fully aware of what you will be encountering. There is an interesting story here about abuses of power and the lengths some will go to avoid responsibility for said acts, however, it tends to get a little lost amid all of the time jumps and lack of urgency (and agency) from some of the characters.I read this book as an ARC from the publisher and NetGalley. All opinions are my own.
5995529284	Dark academia, a new term for me, but one that describes this book exactly. Murder, suicide, coverups, teachers grooming and using young girls at the school, and lots of secrets. Throw in a student that knows what is going on and is trying desperately to set things straight and remain undercover and you have the ingredients for a captivating story. Although there was a lot going on to keep track of at times, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Thank you to NetGalley for the advance read copy.
6466099459	It's not fair to blame a book for not being the book you wanted it to be, but the trouble was that I could see that book so clearly within the pages of When We Were Silent, that I kept wanting the other stuff to just get out of the way. What I wish this book was is a coming of age story in 1980s Ireland, with a smart, feisty teen protagonist navigating a troubled home life, young love, and a swim coach who is abusing her and most everyone else she knows. That's enough. Heck, that's MORE than enough for a novel, and McPhillips has the chops to write that book. I know, because it's buried in there. I read it. Unfortunately, When We Were Silent wants to be a thriller, so that story gets buried under a whole lot of STUFF that doesn't really help the story along. There are continual complications (a skeevy moneylender, a private investigation and deals with newspapers, endangered daughters, etc.) that appear tacked on and do little to add to either the depth of the story or to any kind of thriller/mystery structure. Very little about the legal aspects of the book seem believable, especially the courtroom scene, and I really don't want to be that nit-picky reader who points out every little inaccuracy, but more importantly, I don't need to be. Those scenes don't really have a place in the story anyway. I love genre writing, and I believe wholeheartedly that one thing genre can do is to offer a framework to hang a story on, to give a shape to the story that the writer really wants to tell, but in this case it felt like the story was fighting upstream against the author's insistence that this is a thriller, and there must be both mysteries (easily inferred) and large external conflicts to drive the plot. But we don't need those things. We just need a story with strong characters, well-grounded in a time and place, with the problems of their own little world. When We Were Silent has those things. I just wish that it trusted them enough to let them carry the novel.
6339377868	This book was an incredibly moving story that had me hooked from the start. The characters, and especially the main character, draw you in and you don’t want to stop reading because you need to know what happens next. I was happy that the multiple plot lines all came together at the end and made the story even more powerful. I would definitely read more from this author! Thank you to the publishers for an ARC in exchange for my unbiased review.
6524821250	Don't know where to start with this one. The writing is stellar, something that can be missing from this genre. The plot is interesting and kept me turning the pages.It's the jumping storyline from the past to the present. I know it's all one story but I found the ending so predictable. Also. there are too many "side stories" That are plain unnecessary that get wrapped up so easily I wonder why they were included in the first place. I think this one just needed a little tightening up and it would have sung. I am interested to read what the author writes next.
6741150793	This was my first book by this author and I enjoyed their writing style; it was engaging and beautifully written. The story surprised me with some unexpected twists that kept me hooked. However, a few parts felt a bit slow for my taste. Overall, it was a decent read with memorable characters and an intriguing plot.
6365880126	This is a book that people are going to have mixed feelings and emotions about. It does have several trigger warnings for abuse, sexual violence, suicide, exploitation. This book for me is one that is going to stay with me forever. It is a story, a raw, emotional, and thought provoking book that I felt the author did a phenomenal job writing. It is about an incredibly sensitive and emotional subject that a lot of people don’t want to hear about, are too traumatized by personal experiences, or choose to pretend doesn’t exist. However bravo to McPhillips for opening the doors to a world of how authority, privilege, and power can change some people’s lives forever and in the most extreme ways. The main character, Louise, or Lou is a teenage girl that is thrown into a new school that is for the exclusive and prestigious. A world that she does not come from nor does she know anything about but unfortunately, she is about to learn way more than she wants to in ways that will change the course of her life and everyone in it. She does end up making friends, and eventually a very close friend, but she quickly realizes that this highly sought after school and the authority adults that work there are not at all what they seem, and there are things that are going on behind-the-scenes that no one should ever have to know about or experience, and she is now right in the middle of it. I don’t want to say too much, and give specific details away. This also alternates between the past, and the present, and in the present, Lou is now an adult, and wants nothing more than to put the pass, and the experiences from that school behind her, but suddenly a potential lawsuit threatens to bring everything she experienced back into the spotlight, and unfortunately, for her, there are many things that she never shared with anyone, and if these things are exposed, it could create an entirely new set of traumatic experiences for her. I will admit that this book was a slow start for me, and it did take me some time to get invested in the story but once I was, I was immediately hooked and could not put the book down. I will say it was at times very difficult to read and hear the things that some of these characters had to go through and the effect it had on their lives however, this is what is so important about this book That this author was brave enough to write about these things and shed light on things that many of us don’t want to know about or shy away from reading because it makes us uncomfortable, but ultimately we are responsible for educating ourselves and realizing unfortunately we live in a world that these things do exist, and do still happen. I found myself liking Lou more and more as the book went on, and also started dealing as if I was right there with her as she was going through the ups and downs of the events of her teenage years and now her adult years. I do like how the story unraveled and how it developed it was not rushed and it was realistic and the ending was something that was very real and made me feel so many different emotions. Books like this and stories like this need to be written so it gives issues like this the justice that they so desperately need an. I thought this author did this in a very compassionate, sensitive and educated way.Thank you so much to the Author for having the courage to write this book, Netgalley, and Flatiron Books for the ARC!
6507842817	A huge thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the eARC!When We Were Silent by Fiona McPhillips is the kind of novel that sits heavily on your chest, tackling deep issues of abuse within the landscape of systems built upon power and oppression. Set in Dublin in the 80s, we follow Louise Manson, a girl who transfers to Highfield Manor, a renowned private, Catholic school. Although she is labeled as an outsider upon her arrival, Lou soon becomes immersed in the culture of Highfield, a place with dark secrets. Navigating this minefield of secrets takes a rather deep toll on Lou especially as she grows closer to star swimmer, Shauna Power. Jumping to the present time, we see that Lou is still haunted by what transpired in the halls of Highfield so long ago as secrets seem to never remain buried.Going into this novel based on the synopsis, the theme of "dark academia" seemed to stand out the most given the dark nature by which Highfield is described. Without a doubt, this is a novel that tackles dark topics, but there is an extra emotional emphasis placed on Lou's story that seems to supersede this trope. McPhillips embarks on a rather tricky journey to write these women with nuance and complexity in the face of so much hurt. However, I do believe this is a novel that ultimately sticks the landing regarding the realities of surviving abuse. Lou, Shauna, Melissa, and Joe all share varying reactions when faced with the harsh truths of what is being covered up at Highfield demonstrating the vast impact events such as these hold. There are no clear right or wrong heroes or villains in a story like this, just people doing the best with what they have at the time. Lou's determination to put an end to this abuse is admirable, but her character arc is the perfect example of healing coming in many different forms.There are many things to love about this book from its distinct sense of character, the intricate plot, and the various needle drops from the 80s, but above all, the most impressive feat of this novel is its ability to make you not only think but feel. When We Were Silent is a book that is supposed to give you pause, to evoke strong feelings of anger, sadness, or contemplation. This is not a light-hearted "whodunnit" or locked room mystery, but rather an exploration into the systems of oppression that allow widespread abuse and what justice looks like to survivors. This is a book with a lot of heart that sheds light on the unthinkable. Fans of novels such as "I Have Some Questions for You" by Rebecca Makkai will enjoy this title.
6446786651	This story weaves back and forth between two timelines about a privileged girls school and the secrets that went on there, notably sexual assault and the grooming that is perpetrated before such assault can take place. Louise Manson is a teenager from a working class family headed by a single mother who receives a scholarship to attend Highfield Manor, Dublin’s exclusive private school. She does not fit in with the rich girls that attend. As she navigates her way through trying to blend in by she meets another young girl, Shauna who she feels an instant attraction to. They become good friends and are both athletes that are singled out by the head swim coach. They both enjoy his attention as it makes them feel special, that is until Lou is unnerved by some of the touching and other inappropriate behaviors by the coach. She tells Shauna of this and Shauna doesn't agree, she is willing to go along with such behaviors as it's 'just the way coach is'. The whole thing culminates at the schools swimming pool and Lou is accused of murder. Years later there is another abuse case that has come up and Shauna's brother, a lawyer wants Lou to testify in this trial and speak of her experiences from the past because it has taken place at the same school, Highfield Manor. This is the last thing she wants to do but agrees so she might finally move forward from the guilt and pain she carries from the past. This was a really interesting and captivating novel. It has a lot of secrets that don't come to light until the very end. Well written with a powerful message for readers. Highly recommended. 4.5 stars.Many thank to Net Galley and Macmillan Audio for the opportunity to listen/read an audio version of this novel.
6761250191	When We Were Silent is the debut novel by Irish author Fiona McPhillips, and is a dark academic thriller.I feel that I need to start this review with content/trigger warnings. Whilst it wasn't triggering for me, it deals with subjects that may be, for others, including: child sexual abuse and manipulation, institutional complicity, self-harm and suicide.When Louise (Lou) Manson is approached to add her testimony to a civil case, being brought by a young boy, against the swimming coach of a prestigious private school, she is reluctant. To do so will mean dredging up a past that she has tried hard to forget. When she learns that an old school friend is ready to tell all, Lou becomes concerned that her own secrets may be exposed, especially when she receives an anonymous email from a stranger who says they know everything.Starting with Lou's present day situation, the story switches to the events of the past, during Lou's time at Highfield Manor School, covering the events leading up to, and following 'the incident', before returning to the present, once again.The main themes of this book are, unfortunately, very familiar, to those of us living in Ireland: the abuse of children by adults in a position of power, the 'cover-ups', especially by the Catholic church, and the victim-blaming. These are woven into a tense and gripping storyline, with plenty of twists before the final reveal and resolution.Lou is a very credible main character, both as a teen, and as an adult: her motivations and actions are totally believable.In summary, this is an excellent thriller, which deals with sensitive issues, whilst providing an engaging read. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to reading more, from this author, in the future.
6757563480	I really enjoyed this book, though enjoying isn't the correct word to use considering the subject matter. Using a dual timeline, I was immediately transported to the mid-1980s Ireland as Lou, the fiesty, brave, and traumatised protagonist, tries to bring retribution to the school sexual predator. In doing so, Lou not only finds herself in danger, but every aspect of her life crumbles as she tries to break the patriarchy. The research that has gone into all aspects of this novel is evident from the first chapter.While reading, I felt at times as though I was watching a documentary on the systematic abuse and coverups that are only now coming to the public eye here in Ireland. It is impossible not to feel incredibly angry and frustrated while reading, and the venom I felt towards the swimming coach is only due to the author's talent in creating such credible characters. This is an all-consuming compulsive read that first had me internally saying, "Thank goodness times have changes!" But have they? Maybe slightly for the better, certainly not even nearly enough. Does being wealthy mean you are more credible and deserve to be heard as opposed to those on the lower rungs of the poverty ladder? This novel raises questions, emotions, and debates, and it is a fantastic debut novel powerfully delivered. I would say this book needs to be researched for triggers in advance as the sexual abuse, addiction, suicide could all be very triggering. This really is a great book to be read and discussed. I am very excited to see what Fiona McPhillips writes next!
6433010645	First, thank you to Macmillan for the audiobook! The narrator did an absolutely lovely job. Her voice fit this story so well.This was a difficult book to read. The subject matter is heavy and infuriating and brings up a lot of emotions. There is a lot of depth to this novel, and there are painful (even graphic) sequences. These are all written in a manner that feels appropriate. I think this provides valuable commentary on real-world issues (even though this story is fiction). The characters are messy and frustrating in a way that makes them feel very real. I didn't always love what Lou was doing, but I really felt for her and what she was going through. This deals with a lot of complex issues - sexual assault, grooming, eating disorders, alcoholism, suicide, and many more - and the author navigates these problems with care and nuance. This book infuriated me, it disgusted me, it made me sad. It was certainly a heavy read.Now, I do have a few complaints. First: the present storyline doesn't match up to the past. Some of the present storyline felt draggy and almost boring until the end. Second: some of the present storylines felt unnecessary and like they were a bit too much? Like they just didn't fit. And last: I wanted to see more of the aftermath of the past storyline. The jump from past to present feels so abrupt and I am left with questions.Overall, this was a valuable read with a lot of interesting moments. It took me longer than usual to get through this because of the subject matter, but I'm glad I read it! A 3.75 rounded up.

Some of us will take them to our graves. Some of us already have." I can't say I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked up When We Were Silent, but I must remember that these stories are not for me. I understand the importance of sharing them with the world, but they aren't for me. There was so much about this book that made it difficult to pick up—from the unsettling storyline to the overall pacing. I'm so thankful I received When We Were Silent in audio as well as the physical book because the narrator, India Mullen, made the story easier to read. If you do decide to read When We Were Silent, please know that the premise of the story is about a school covering up their coach's grooming, sexually assaulting, and raping their athletes. 👏🏼 Debut novel✌🏼 Dual timelines🐌 Pacing was off👌🏼 Audiobook narration I recommend reading When We Were Silent if you enjoyed reading My Dark Vanessa.______Follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chaptersofc...Follow me on Goodreads:https://www.goodreads.com/chaptersofc...Follow me on StoryGraph:https://www.instagram.com/chaptersofc...
7650717063	You can read all of my reviews at Nerd Girl Loves Books.I listened to this book and the narrator did a great job. This book is told in two timelines. One at present time, and the other when the main character was a high school student at a private prep school. She's contacted by a lawyer that wants her to provide testimony that her high school has a history of covering up sexual abuse by teachers/coaches in relation to a case he's bringing for a boy that's been abused. She is afraid to do it because she doesn't want to bring up the past again, but eventually agrees to do so. The rest of the story goes back and forth between the events leading up to the old mystery and her life starting to crumble as her testimony becomes public.This book is ok, although I guessed early on the twist. I didn't really connect with the main character and thought she made some stupid decisions, both in the past and present. For me, the book really bogged down in the middle and I had a hard time making myself keep going. Ultimately I'm glad I finished because I always like to see how authors get to their endings.I received a complimentary copy of this book from NetGalley and MacMillan Audio. All opinions are my own.
6340545414	I received an ARC of this book via a goodreads giveaway prize from Flatiron Books.Generally speaking, WHEN WE WERE SILENT is worth reading. I’d consider it a page turner for sure, since I couldn’t stop thinking about it once I started. I really wanted to know what would happen next so I got through the book pretty quickly!In a not particularly organized manner, here are some thoughts about the book:- Abundant pop culture references keyed you in on what time period you are in at any given moment. If you got lost in some of the details, you’d be pulled right back in to the proper context with musical markers. - She was great at setting the scene with succinctly detailed descriptions. Fiona would get you right where you need to be with just one perfectly worded sentence. She’s an expert at providing context!- It was a pleasant surprise that there was queer representation in this book, and Fiona did a nice job at shining a light on the unique experience of falling for a friend including jealousy, infatuation, love, etc. in a context which you’re not allowed to have those feelings (a private Catholic school). Though the queerness of some characters does come into play with the suspense and mystery, it is a natural part of the story and does not feel forced just to create a compelling character. Very nice to see queer representation and normalization that doesn’t feel like it’s only added into the story to prove some point or cause the downfall of a character 😅- character building - I tend to be disinterested in school girl drama as depicted in popular media, however I feel that the dialogue between characters lends itself well to building out the intentions and expectations of the individuals adding to the suspense. There were a couple of soft-launched reveals that made my jaw drop when things clicked and I made the realization.- the conclusion - I do appreciate aspects of the ending, but it was a bit anti climactic. We get a resolution, but it could’ve benefited from a bit more detail. After spending the first 300+ pages with a well paced cadence, it felt like I suddenly rushed through the end and it didn’t leave me fully satisfied. - There are some pretty triggering scenes and description. Some things could’ve been worded a bit differently to protect the reader… not that you can ever create something that’s perfect for all readers, but an adjustment would make the book much more palatable to a wider audience. There are many readers that might get too much of a gut punch to finish the whole book. Again, it can’t be perfect for every reader, and I’m sure there was intention behind being clear about what actually happened rather than skirting the issue, but I do think the language could be a little more sensitive during particularly brutal explanations/scenes (suicide and rape in particular). Though it isn’t my favorite book I’ve ever read, I would recommend giving it a go. It’s a different take on a type of storyline that we’re unfortunately all too familiar with. It certainly is memorable and I will pass along my copy to friends because I’m eager to discuss their thoughts on it all. I can’t wait to follow along with the author and see what else she produces in the future!
6338750675	This book was a very interesting read. It jumped between the past and the present to uncover the mystery. While they were revealing the truth, I kept getting surprised by what was happening. I was not expecting the ending and the plots leading up to it. When We Were Silent handled very tough topics and how people deal with, internalize, and struggle with trauma. Listening to this helps normalize different reactions to trauma and shares how people respond to these situations and that there is no right way to deal with it. Hearing about so many people being sexually abused was heartbreaking, especially since so many people have been in that scenario.Initially, I was very anxious and intrigued to find out what was happening, and I almost wish I had found some stuff out sooner. Books where they talk about the past but do not explain it are hard for me to follow along with because I’m nosy and want to know all the details, lol. There was nothing wrong with how the story was told; it was done very well, and the differentiation was clear! I just struggle with these storylines. I think this scenario was handled in a way that empowered the main character and even showed some of the women's struggles with men and people believing their stories. The Narrator did a really good job expressing the characters' emotions and making it clear when other people were talking.
6188964012	Thanks to NetGalley for the eARC of this novel. This is a dual timeline novel. The 80s story is of a working class teenage girl who goes to the most prestigious girls' school in Dublin to avenge her best friend who had been abused but gets in way over her head. Fast forward to the present where this same school is in trouble for allowing the same kind of behavior, and the former student is asked to give a statement for a case. The 80s part of the novel is far more compelling, and the dialogue and the descriptions of Dublin's neighborhoods feel very authentic. The protagonist, Lou Manson, is such an outsider that she has no idea what she is up against. The book thoroughly explores issues of gender, class, and sexuality during that era. The ease with which a predator could operate is vividly described. The modern portion of the novel leaves something to be desired. The older version of Lou seems to have confused motivations, and the daughter's story feels excessive and tacked on. Most of the big events were easily predicted.
6376660885	I received a free audiobook from NetGalley in exchange for a fair review. When we were silent is a gripping, unsettling story of abuse, trust, teenage bonding, and how trauma affects our lives long after it takes place. Set in an elite girl’s school in Ireland in the 80s and today, this book follows Louise and several other students and their lives during their school days and years later. A horrific incident happens at Highfield Manor that affects Lou’s life forever. She’s confused and upset about how her fellow students react to the event, but moves on with her life, or so she thinks. When a lawsuit threatens to take her back to confront her trauma, Lou must decide how she can navigate her past and future. This is an excellent debut novel, full of great characters, current affairs, and unsettling moments. It’s not for the faint of heart however, and there are graphic descriptions of sexual assault, violence, and other terrible betrayals. It’s a very good book, but it is definitely not for every reader.
