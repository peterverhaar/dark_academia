66408746	Shockingly, not a whole hell of a lot of vampire stuff up in this bitch.Mostly, it read like a dull travelogue with lots of emotions.Bro love everywhere.All the men loved all the women (platonically or otherwise) to the point they were willing to give their lives for whichever lucky lady was Dracula's snack at the time.It was quite the love fest. Quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm buying that, Stoker.And Dracula?Not since Gary Olman's beehived old woman portrayal have I been less scared of this character.Welcome to my home. Allow me to get you some Entenmann's coffee cake whilst you peruse my garage sale knick-knack collection and trip over my cats...So, I've come to realize that very few of the classic characters or stories even remotely resemble what you think they will based on their modern counterparts. And in my uneducated opinion, most classics just aren't all that much fun to read. They're boring and filled up with tedious shit that I don't care about, and certainly don't want to read about. <-- Scenery, weather, random feelings about the scenery or weather, etc..I guess back in the day it was high fun to take walks, look at the landscape, and then go back home and write about it in your diary. And while I'm sure that sounds like heaven to some people who yearn for simpler times, the idea of reading about the nonsense of someone else's daily life makes me want to scratch my eyes out. Something I was surprised by, although in retrospect I shouldn't have been, was all the religious undertones in the story. Ok, yes. I knew Dracula was evil and couldn't be near crosses and whatnot, but I didn't think about this being a casually religious story about saving souls from damnation. Which, I mean, it's not like it was any fault of the vampires that they were dammed. At one time or another, they had all been humans who were targeted by another vampire as a snack. Vicious cycle and all that.And poor Lucy seemingly ended up a chew toy simply because she was a sleepwalker.Perhaps the moral of the story is that you need to make sure you aren't wandering around on moors at night so you don't get spotted by anemic monsters? Speaking of Lucy, did anyone else notice how incredibly fucking lucky she was that every single guy in their group was a compatible blood type for her? All those blood transfusions! None of them even remotely hygienic or safe. Forget supernatural demons who turn into bats - those transfusions were the scariest shit in this entire book.Brace yourself, because there are a lot of characters and POV switches. Again, most of what they were saying wasn't all that interesting, so it made me doubly happy that I decided to go with the audiobook version of Stoker's tale. And if I'm being 100% honest here, I probably zoned out a few times and daydreamed about when I needed to get the oil changed in my car or what we were having for dinner. But this is one of those books with a lot of superfluous information, so I don't think it hurt anything. I got the gist of it all okay without hanging on every word. Fair warning, the first half of this book is unbelievably dull. Mina writes in her diary about how she fretts over Jonathan's lack of letters from Transylvania & how hard it is to keep Lucy from wandering out the door at night, Lucy gets mysteriously ill & her fiancee gets worried, and the doctor dude (John Seward) moons over Lucy & watches one of his psychotic patients eat bugs. Renfield, being the only character in the book who doesn't want to talk about friendship & loyalty every five minutes, was by far my favorite. The second half of the book was only slightly more engaging to me, but at least there was a bit of urgency to it at that point. Van Helsing was on to Dracula, so garlic was being thrown over everything, stakes were being handed out like candy, and anything pertinent was being kept from Mina so as not to upset her delicate sensibilities. And then when that backfired spectacularly, they cut her into the loop and she was able to do an old-timey version of what a competent woman looked like. They even compared her brain to that of a man! <--I love these old books. Really.And what about Dracula?Well, he was sort of this shadow figure that lurked around the edges of the book. You never really meet him. I know, right?! What about the whole Vlad the Impaler thing? How he fixated on Johathan & Mina for some reason? Buzzz! Nope.Ok, get this: Dracula had been sort of like a special needs zombie who was finally learning stuff - like math...and how to employ minions to carry his dirt around for him. Apparently, up to this point, he had just been harassing his neighbors and nibbling on Romanian women. This whole thing with Lucy & Mina was supposed to be his bid at going global. Thank god for Van Helsing and his wacky foreign-man knowledge of urban legends.I guess one of the oddest things that I realized about this horror story was that when Lucy & Mina started turning toward the dark side, they got sexy. Yeah. Like, that was how you could tell they were creatures of the dammed. The men got all freaked out and weepy because their sweet, mild-mannered ladies lost their wholesome looks. They became wanton hussies with throaty voices and pouty lips. Holy shit, right? If that doesn't say something about how wackadoo things used to be, I don't know what will. Innocence or else!Anyway. This wasn't really a fun read but I'm glad I can finally say I've managed to put it behind me. Plus, it's one of those weird little windows into the past that reminds you things aren't as bad as they could be. I'd definitely recommend listening to the audio version with Tim Curry & Alan Cumming if you decide to go that route. The entire voice cast of this one really helped make it palatable for someone like myself who doesn't have the fortitude to read classics on their own.
2506047139	I find Victorian horror so interesting as a microcosm of reaction to social norms of the time, to the buttoned-down and repressed social climate of the time, to the “new moral standards” of the church and the new questions brought up and hidden away by scientific thought. But under the fabric of late Victorian society lay wide ranges of change; the increased marriage rate and idea of the domestic sphere for women giving way to the New Woman, the upper class vs. lower class divide giving way to a new middle class. With the growth of the economy came new ideas of English excellence; with the growth of scientific thought, scientific racism. Literature, as is usual, struggles to react. With a growing counterculture in literature came the reaction to such; at the trial of author Oscar Wilde, passages from his only novel were read to prove that he liked men. Soon after, Bram Stoker, formerly his acquaintance, began writing Dracula. The result is a book drenched in fear of the unknown: In xenophobia of the time, in homophobia, and in the anxieties that come when that who embodies both appears. That is what sticks with me, to this day, about Dracula.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
500802738	Two things about this book:1. It is a really great and creepy story that deserves classic status2. Everything is repeated soooooo much without any obvious benefit.Here is actual footage of Bram Stoker writing this novel:If Stoker had just got to the point, this book would have been much more exciting and suspenseful. I understand the exact same mysterious thing happens night after night. I understand that Dracula has some boxes of dirt. I get that you brought Winchester rifles along for protection. Each of these things was repeated ad nauseam throughout the book. Talk about killing the pace - by the time the gruesome scares came I was very disengaged. Also, funny thing about this book as a horror story - it must be the grandfather of heading up the stairs to hide instead of running outside or cutting through the graveyard shortly after hearing a serial killer is loose. They keep leaving people alone even though those people are repeatedly attacked when they are left alone. Then, when they finally insist on guarding someone, that person insists that they need no one but God to guard them!? Seems like so far God had not been interested in protecting, so why count on him starting now!?So three stars because it is a classic and I like the story. I especially like Lucy's suitors - their gung ho manliness amuses me. But the repetition and the illogical behavior in the face of a bloodsucking monster are the cause of the removal of a couple of stars.
208650737	Dracula: the very name instantly brings to mind visions of vampires, stakes, garlic, and crucifixes. Yet, when one bothers to read the novel, it becomes self-evident how twisted modern vampire fiction now is.Vampires are not meant to inhabit the roles of heroes. Go back a few hundred years and men believed truly that the vampire was a real immortal, cursed to quench his undying thirst with a living mortal’s blood. The very idea of a blood drinker should, therefore, inspire the image of a villain within the mind. And that is what the titular character of this novel is.The word novel is not used lightly, as one could also write that this is a collaboration of journals, letters and papers. For that is how Bram Stoker chose to fashion his famous novel (in epistolary form). While the different viewpoints through each journal serve to create suspense which suits the gothic tone of the novel perfectly.In all, it is a macabre novel that serves to make the reader reflect upon good and evil. The vampire, to me, is nothing more than an indication of man’s cursed nature. Who, unless he is delivered, must suck the life from others around him. Ultimately only the righteous can destroy the darkness that serves to drain life. That is the lesson which Bram Stoker's timeless classic unswervingly conveys.
4490181	I was rather disappointed by this classic. It started out with promise, especially the Jonathan Harker bits. Then all the male characters descended into blubbering worshippers of the two female characters, and by the end of the novel, I was wishing Dracula could snack on all of them and be done with it. I kept having to put it aside and read chapters in between other books, but I managed to finish it at last.
863901090	What a Leech! London, 1890s. Jonathan Harker returns from Transylvania, a series of bizarre incidents start taking place all around Whitby soon after. Worst of all, a strange malady seems to be slowly draining the life out of the helpless Lucy. Mina, her most trusted friend, unable to help her. After some investigations it’s concluded the deed to be the sole work of a mysterious figure of the night, none other than Count Dracula himself. Jonathan Harker, Mina’s fiancé, and Professor Van Helsing, the only ones that may be able to stop him, once and for all.This is IT! The original work, the mother of all bloodsuckers, the holy grail of vampirism, the genius masterpiece of Bram Stoker that for better or worse spanned an infinity of books, movies, series and any vampire-like machination. The story of the intrepid Jonathan Harker and the delicate Mina, the gentlemanly Arthur and the angelic Lucy, the charismatic Doctor Seward and the wise and audacious Van Helsing. And of course, how to forget him, the all-father of anything undead, the quintessential vampire, the immortal, machiavellian and all powerful Count Dracula. (view spoiler)[ May he rest in peace.

Not their best performance at all, and I especially disliked Sadie Frost as Lucy. Some none scripted scenes, awkward atmosphere and pacing, and honestly on the whole a little over the top.

1906206167	Another case of me starting a review with no idea how to rate it. This book was…a ride.I think my professor put it best when he said, “Dracula is either really good or really sh*tty.” Okay, yes, I’m paraphrasing, but only a little.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This book is quite a feat, either way. You can read essentially ANY THEME into this novel: good and evil, race, religion, gender, science, wealth, power, abstinence, war, colonization. More, probably, but it’s a Monday and I had four hours straight of math tonight and I’m sleeeeepy. Anyway, that all sounds peachy keen, right? Emma, I imagine you saying, what do you mean it could be shitty? Look at all those themes! It’s the great Irish novel, maybe! I know, imaginary reader. I hear ya. But there are things about this book that are even weirder than that quasi-sex scene. (The joke is that you can’t tell which one. There are a million symbolic moments of characters gettin’ it on. Truly wild.)BUT OKAY. It’s not just that there are a bajillion themes. Because that would be cool. No, it’s that you can make an argument for either side of every theme. Sexist or feminist; condemning religion or supporting it; racist or accepting; et cetera et cetera. The book is also straight up teeming with stuff like repetition that can either be thematically significant or just a bad job. (Can you imagine being the editor of this book? “Uh, Bram?…Hey buddy. So, you use essentially the same passage describing Dracula’s powers three times in one chapter, so – I was, you know, wondering – are you a genius or a total dumbass?” If I achieve my dream of being an editor/publisher I’m only editing YA. Too scary.)The upside of all this was that this book was such a blast to discuss in class. (A substantial f*cking improvement from slogging through boring old Huck Finn everyday for two weeks.) We would spend like an hour on a page, trying to discern sexism from feminism and desperately seeking homosexual overtones. (OH BOY DID WE FIND THEM, AND OH BOY DID WE LOVE DOING IT.) Anyway. In-depth textual analysis is like, my favorite thing.This shindig was intermittently a blast (ohmygod! Vampires were fun even in 1897!) and soooo boring (ohmygod. What is up with plotlines from 1897). Still, I gotta give mad props to this book, because I read it EXCLUSIVELY by forcing myself through it in 110-page chunks in one work-study shift…and I still enjoyed it most of the time. That never happens! Sure as shit didn’t happen with Huck Finn.The characters really sucked, but that happens a lot with classics. Weird that a handful of these endured, though. I won’t miss them even if I end up missing reading this. (It’s been a big part of my life for a while! Okay, like a couple weeks, but that’s a long time for me.)But I do think this book is sexist, and I don’t think it’s close to perfect, and there are creepy issues with consent and metaphoric sexual assault and gender roles, and I wanted to write a paper on this book being an allegory of the battle between science and religion (religion won, guys!) but was FORCED to write on gender, the most clichéd topic of them all. Still, though, this book impressed me. (To clarify I wasn’t excited that religion won. I’m excited that said conclusion fit with my hypothetical essay.)Bottom line: I think I liked this? I definitely recommend it. It’s cool to see what started (not actually but don’t @ me) all our cultural whatnot with vampires. (Still not that into them though. I say while technically currently reading some dumb book about them.)
4317008833	Friend John, this should have been a short story!Dracula is a spooky story which begins with Jonathan Harker, an attorney who travels to Transylvania to help his client, Count Dracula, purchase a home in London. However, Dracula is behaving strangely. Will Jonathan make it out alive?Holy smokes! This book is B-O-R-I-N-G! No wonder there are so many Dracula books and movies because almost anyone else could have done it better!The book itself has an interesting format—it is told through various characters’ journals, telegrams, and letters. But---oh, the writing style! Huge, long, gigantic paragraphs! Dracula reminded me of The Scarlett Letter because, although it did have some interesting elements, it was so long and drawn out. If the filler was cut out, it would have made a compelling short story. “Friend John” was mentioned so many times…….This is a book that is so poorly written that I am confident that I could write something better. Apparently, I am not alone in this thought as there have been many, many other versions. 2025 Reading ScheduleJan A Town Like AliceFeb BirdsongMar Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr War and PeaceMay The Woman in WhiteJun AtonementJul The Shadow of the WindAug Jude the ObscureSep UlyssesOct Vanity FairNov A Fine BalanceDec GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Insta My Bookstore at Pango
1207277774	Dracula is, of course, one of the most renowned horror stories, and the most well-known vampire novel. Bram Stoker set the ground rules for what a vampire should be, and set the benchmark for all other writers of the vampire afterwards. Indeed, if tyrannical villains are a necessity of Gothic fiction then Count Dracula is the father of all gothic villains, in spite of it being one of the last Gothic fiction novels to be written. It’s a work of genius that his presence is felt so strongly in the novel with him appearing in the flesh so rarely. "His face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils, with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth. These protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed. The chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor. The atmosphere of the novel is unmistakably gothic. It is impossible to talk about Dracula without mentioning the Gothic; the two are one and the same. The decaying castle in which the book begins is testimony to the eeriness that follows. The "damsel in distress" motif appears quite often in Gothic literature, and none so much as Dracula. Mina and Lucy are both damsels at some point, and even Harker himself can be seen as one at the start when he is rescued by his wife that has a “man’s brain.” It’s quite a subversion of the standard gender roles, at this point, and quite funny really. On initial inspection the plot of the book can be summed up in a few short sentences: Dracula wishes to create more vampires in Victorian London; his attempts are thwarted and he and his kind are exterminated. But, the novel is so much more than that. It represents Victorian fears and fancies; it is a comment on women’s position in society and underpins their sexual desires (and perhaps fears.) It suggests a struggle between modernity and science with religion and superstition. It harbours the effect of Darwinian thought on man as Dracula himself represent the idea of “survival of the fittest.” The undertones of sexuality and disease that occur so frequently symbolise the time in which it was written. Each one of these has been a topic for commentaries on Dracula, and academic essays. Indeed, the extrinsic value of this novel is incredibly high. Bram Stoker also explores the theme of sanity with many of his characters, not just Renfield. At some point, every character wonders whether their dealings with the Count are born from some mental deficiency rather than a paranormal encountering with the villain. This clashes the Victorian realism view with the paranormal events that occur in the novel. There are also issues of identity, and how this is affected by transgression. It can further be seen as an allegory for religious redemption and a comment on colonisation. I think I’ve said enough; if I say anything else I will break my “500 words a review” rule. As you can probably tell I’m quite passionate about this book: it is brilliant; at this point, I can honestly say that Dracula is one of my favourite novels of all time: I just love it. I might even write my dissertation on it and Gothic Literature. Dracula rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1128010074	Why did it take me so long to read this masterpiece? It’s a classic for a reason, and now I know why. Brilliantly written, with engaging and intelligent characters.

29292239	'Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely. And leave something of the happiness you bring!'These are pretty much the first words spoken to Jonathan Harker, one of the heroes of Bram Stoker's Dracula, upon his arrival at Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania, just minutes after a nightmare journey through the landscape of gothic horror: darkness, howling wolves, flames erupting out of the blue, frightened horses. Within a few days of his arrival, Harker will find himself talking of the Count's 'wickedly blazing eyes' and 'new schemes of villainy' and have some hair-raising encounters with the man who is now the world's most famous vampire: 'The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me, with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.' Several adventures involving sharp teeth, mirrors, garlic, crucifixes, bloody-mouthed corpses and big stakes will ensue. The above quotations should make it abundantly clear what kind of book Dracula is. It's sensation fiction, written nearly half a century after the heyday of that genre. It's a cross between an epistolary novel, a detective novel and a save-my-wife story, and it's full of scares, horror and disgust, all described in a lurid tone that befits the subject: the living dead. Or the Un-Dead, as the book's other hero, my countryman Van Helsing, calls them.Sadly, Van Helsing is one of my main problems with the book. While I love his heroism, his 'Let's-do-it' attitude and his unceasing struggle for Mina's soul, I find him entirely unconvincing as a Dutchman. I wish to God (with a crucifix and everything!) that I could switch off my inner linguist and appreciate the story for its narrative qualities rather than its linguistic aspects, but Stoker has Van Helsing indulge in so many linguistic improbabilities ('Are you of belief now, friend John?') that it quite took me out of the story, again and again and again. I'm aware this is not a problem that will bother many readers, but I for one dearly wish Stoker had listened to some actual Dutchmen before making the hero of his story one. Then perhaps he also would have refrained from making the poor man mutter German whenever he is supposed to speak his mother tongue. ('Mein Gott' is German, Mr Stoker. I mean, really.)Linguistic inaccuracies aside (there are many in the book), Dracula has a few more problems. For one thing, the bad guy doesn't make enough appearances. Whenever Stoker focuses on Dracula, the story comes alive -- menace drips off the pages, and the reader finds himself alternately shivering with excitement and recoiling in horror. However, when Dracula is not around (which is most of the second half of the book), the story loses power, to the point where the second half of the book is actually quite dull. In addition, the story seems a little random and unfocused. Remember the 1992 film, in which Dracula obsesses about Mina Harker (Jonathan's wife) because she is his long-lost wife reincarnated? That conceit had grandeur, romance, passion, tragedy. And what was more, it made sense. It explained why Dracula comes all the way from Transylvania to England to find Mina, and why he wants to make her his bride despite the fact that she is being protected by people who clearly want him dead. In the book, however, Mina is merely Jonathan's wife (no reincarnation involved), a random lady Dracula has sunk his teeth into, and while this entitles her to some sympathy, it lacks the grand romantic quality the film had. I guess it's unfair to blame an author for not thinking of an improvement film-makers later made to his story, but I think Stoker rather missed an opportunity there.And then there's the fact that Stoker seems to be an early proponent of the Robert Jordan School of Writing, meaning he takes an awful lot of time setting the scene, only to end the book on a whimper. The ending to Dracula is so anticlimactic it's rather baffling. Did Stoker run out of paper and ink? Did he want to finish the story before Dracula's brides came and got him? I guess we'll never know.Still, despite its many flaws Dracula is an exciting read (well, the first half is, anyway), and Stoker undeniably left a legacy that will last for centuries to come. In that respect, Dracula deserves all the praise that has been heaped on it. I still think it could have been better, though. Much better.
3036211190	No hay mucho que decir, es un clásico y es ¡una joya!
72804672	I believe this may be the edition I read "first". This is an amazing book. I've read reviews by those who disagree and reviews by those who hated the format. But I was swept up in it the first time I read it as a teen and have been every time since. My advice is don't worry about all the psychological baggage that has been tacked on over the years...and please don't confuse the movie "Bram Stoker's Dracula" with the actual plot, story, and characters in the book. It doesn't remotely resemble the book and the title has galled me since that movie came out. The book is far, far better.I believe it's worth noting that a lot of the psychological baggage that has been attached to this volume probably tells you more about the ones attaching it than the book. This book creates a horror atmosphere that has been copied constantly over the years but never quite captured again. You'll be experiencing with Harker the castle and what he faces there. Battling the Count in England...and the terror of the ship's crew that carried his earth boxes across the sea, all will stay with you. Again let me urge you no matter how well any movie has been done, if the movie Dracula is the only one you know, you haven't met the proto-vampire who resides in this book. He/it still walks through literature and even more in the dark fears that lurk in the back of our minds when we're alone on a stormy night or we have to walk alone past that old rundown graveyard (not cemetery) where the city has never gotten around to installing those street lights.This isn't Twilight, nor is it Buffy the vampire Slayer, there aren't any friendly, helpful, romantic vampires here. (None sparkle either) There is quite probably a reason (or maybe more than one) why we wish so badly to laugh at this book. It does what it does very, very well...and that's be frightening. This book is a classic that has been around for over a hundred years..there's a reason for that."We" just read this in the Supernatural Readers group...and I still like it. LOL
2336179810	A classic literary masterpiece!!! Here's an example of Stoker's writing, from Jonathan Harker's journal shortly after he was taken prisoner by Count Dracula in his castle:"I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness."and then..."But my feelings turned to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down, with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings."add to this..."I saw fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall."Wow! What writing. I gave this five stars, I mean, who wouldn't? It is also in my favorites bookshelf. A must read for classic horror.
2506035086	** spoiler alert ** Dracula, the book, struck a chord with me. In it was a fight between good and evil. Modern vampires have great seduction powers. I never liked that. I also didn't like vampires in many Urban Fantasy books. The Hollows series spring to mind. The greatest change in the villainous vampires arises in Anne Rice's books. It was a perfect case study of an idea done to the death.In Dracula, several people record their impressions. I 'pretend' to know that the women in the books, Lucy and Mina, have the same voice. Maybe the men are slightly different. They possess greater vocabulary, such as Lord Godalming's, and Jonathan Harker's recollections. Van Helsing, being a foreigner has his mistakes in grammar, and therefore has the most unique voice.Throughout the book, we don't see the vampire Dracula triumph much. Except maybe when he turns Lucy into an undead. But even then, through the guiding hands and the knowledge of van Helsing, she is freed from her shackles. But Jonathan escapes from his imprisonment. And the vampire cannot settle in London. He was found out by our 'A-team' and had to flee for his life. He expresses baffled malignity.It is the testament to Bram Stoker's neatness that I could follow most of the story. And I'm in awe of his mind, which chronicles the entire story via journal entries (or phonograph recordings in the case of John Steward), all of which are dated. I don't mean outdated, but dated, day after day. And I mourned the death of Quincy Morris, gallant to the end, dying with a smile on his lips.The entire book defies what happens in movies and series (of which latter I've watched only True Blood). Most people don't read books regularly. So their idea of the vampire comes from horror movies. And Boris Karloff and especially Bela Lugosi as vampires are etched in the minds of most people. I don't think cinephiles will get any influence from the 1992 movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. That was a mess. The book still stands proud. As it should. Thus ends my review on 02 Sep 2018.
4038242199	Dracula seems to be one of those love-it or hate-it type books, but for me it is all love! The opening chapters alone provide some of the most gripping, suspense-inducing, edge-of-seat anxieties I've ever read, all leading up to a delightfully queer twist with a male character stepping in for the traditional Gothic heroine.Jonathan Harker fulfills the damsel in distress role quite suitably, being locked away in a remote castle and forced to navigate the domineering personality of his captor. Dracula is reminiscent of Montoni from Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho, particularly in the way he has control over Jonathan's sexual well-being. When the three weird sisters close in on an unaccompanied Jonathan, Dracula stops them at the last second, saying “This man belongs to me!” before Harker “sank down unconscious."Outside of Jonathan getting his chance to faint like the best of Gothic women, this dominating dialogue can't help but have a sexual undertone. There's just something about a vampire's possessiveness, affixation with tender neck flesh, the nocturnal visits and dangling appeal of immortality that make them hot, hot, hot! Some readers may read terror in these lines, but I think it's hard to deny at least some titillation at Jonathan’s situation of total submission. Anyway, it is possible to have two feelings at once. Horror and eroticism may seem like polar opposites, but I think they go together like PB&J.Dracula’s female selections also get to experience this ethereal mixture of terror and desire while under the vampire’s spell. Lucy dazedly roams the midnight hour in her nightgown, meeting the "king vampire" for a moonlit rendezvous. Mina, too, the novel's surprisingly dynamic female star, a rare treat in 19th century lit, goes so far as to engage in a bizarre perversity of sucking upon Dracula’s bleeding breast. Though she claims to be induced to such behavior by a trance, one wonders how much arm-twisting or brain fog was necessary. If we are to see the vampire’s bite as sexually desirable, symbolically or literally, perhaps these creatures of the night are less monster and more orchestrator of dreams. After all, Dracula is a convenient outlet for taboos to be explored, experienced, and excused from public shame. Something like that might have been especially appealing to a sexually repressed 1897 audience.Despite being the most famous and enduring vampire novel of all time, Dracula remains a must-read classic. You won't be surprised by some details because Stoker's vampire "rules" are public knowledge by now, but that doesn't make the novel any less thrilling, enticing, and occasionally shocking. There's some really gruesome moments that totally caught me off guard. Also, the epistolary storytelling device works well. There's a lot of subtleties hidden in the diary entries that slowly build horror—arguably too slowly—and the effect is notably more realistic and more chilling than even the novel’s impressive reputation had me expecting. So happy to finally check this read off my bucket list!!PS: For Stephen King fans, IT is so clearly modeled after Dracula that it's almost shocking. Every beat of this classic appears somewhere in King's book, with Dracula and Pennywise sharing many traits and the power of working together being a major theme. The way the monster controls side characters is also familiar. Renfield and Henry Bowers share a lot in common, for instance, as do Mina and Bill's wife.
4281404330	I want to finish the year with the review of one of my favorite books of the reading year, one that I thought heavily about after reading it. Dracula is a widely known classic story, one that is engraved in our culture and one that inspired and still inspires numerous pieces of art. One can say that we are collectively attracted to Dracula, and vampires in general. What does make this story more appealing to the whole civilization, in the Victorian era, as well as in the present time? Stoker wrote Dracula in 1897, at the end of the Victorian era. The Victorian era is famous for the progress in the field of science, men of the era relying on logic and reason in the strive for the synthesis that will explain how does that the world function, and liberate us from diseases and suffering. At the same time, strict morality and obedience to social and religious conventions were prominent. Everything that deviated from decency and established values had to be disguised and ruthlessly suppressed in order to maintain the idea of the progress of civilization. In the Victorian era, science and religion worked together to free civilized man from the destructive aspects of nature. At the same time, there is the rise of gothic literature and the birth of the horror genre, as the art rose from the repression. This is the response of romanticism to the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but also puritanism and religious austerity that accepts only certain characteristics of men. Gothic genre rises as both compensation and exploration of taboos and forbidden topics and impulses. Gothic writers express their unconscious preoccupations of the collective - sexual passion, aggression, murder, death, decay, incest, curse, madness. Here, Dracula finds its important spot. Dracula is a predator that is between the world of the living and the inanimate, he has strength and longevity, is immortal but only as long as he consumes the physical, mental, life energy of others. In that way, he represents the anti-thesis and archetypal opposition to Christ, who gives his blood to others in order for them to have eternal life. Christ rejuvenates and redeems body, soul and spirit, while Dracula is the living dead that curses body, maddens soul and corrupts spirit, a dead creature that has lost its spirit and soul and therefore is not subject to moral and ethical norms and conventions. Therefore, through him, we are free to explore taboo and psychoanalytically significant topics: repressed sexuality, oral sadism and necrophilia.Dracula is the repressed collective darkness in the world that is enlightened by both reason and Christ. Dracula has the characteristics of 19th-century villains; he is a stranger, lives far away in a foreign land (home and homeland were sacred in the victorian era), he has bestial elements (pronounced, sharp fangs) and is very much connected with the natural world (he manages wind and storms, and summons wolves). At the same time, he is a mysterious, absent protagonist; like an optical illusion, Stoker finishes him in the mind of the beholder; we learn about him solely from the reports of others and their subjective perception. The Count is poorly defined - indefinite, almost intangible, he changes forms, is elusive, connected only with the underworld, seen in the night, lives in the darkness of the unconscious - he is created from one's forebodings, imagination and projections. The central part of the story is how correct, moral characters react to him. Jonathan, Lucy, Mina - for everyone he has a different role, and the multiplicity of his character is evident.Count Dracula and his brides operate through fascination, seduction, enchantment, obsession, loss of soul, madness - all dissociation and suppression of consciousness through overbearing unconscious elements. They are a threat from the underworld, a threat to life and the conscious world. The sexual element is prominent and present, let us remind ourselves that Dracula goes to night visits to women, where they participated in the bodily fluid exchange, while the vampire brides are much less subtly erotic and seductive. JonathanJonathan is a young hero that embarks on a journey into the unknown, a distant castle in "one of the most cruel and least known parts of Europe."This is an area beyond the ordinary, where something unusual will almost certainly happen - "every known superstition in the world is gathered in the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the center of some imaginative vortex."He is on a heroic journey to the land of the unconscious where the rules of the rational do not rule and the past, superstitious, irrational, supernatural still retains power.“...And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.”Is important to note that Jonathan is on the verge of maturity - he is engaged, he has passed the final exam that qualifies him for the profession, his boss has expectations, so he has to step into adult roles and responsibilities. Jonathan needs to complete the formation of ego and adult identity to function in the real world; the moment he meets his shadow in the figure of Count. Interestingly, the Count does not attack him, only keeps him as a prisoner in his castle- even protects him from predatory vampire brides. In Jonathan's case, they are more dangerous than Dracula - they have greater opportunity to besiege and enchant victims as men, have more open sexual magnetism and predatory sexuality (unlike Dracula who creates confusion and comes with a deception that is not elaborated). Dracula and the Brides represent the negative counter-sexual aspects that seduce and offer a lot but take autonomy in the process - through enchantment capture the person in the unconscious. Here Jonathan's desire to have sex is transformed into an attack through denial; attraction and love in repulsion and sadism. Repressed sexual desires turn into morbid signals that point to a constant association of sadism and fear - normal sexuality in repression tends to regress to an earlier form, the first of which is oral sadism. The attitude towards vampires represents the aggression, hatred, and fear toward the object of desire we tend to demonize.Vampire brides also represent the Madonna- whore complex that is engraved in Victorian society - where a woman being sexual equals woman being demonic and evil. In Jonathan's case, Dracula is a much more concrete character than in, for instance, an encounter with Lucy, we get his most detailed descriptions. He is a mature person with whom Jonathan has the most communication and contact, Count is here in the archetype of the Wise old man who rules a wild, dangerous area, who has knowledge, precision, organization, clarity and separation - a Logos that protects him from the Eros of women. Let us not forget that Jonathan sees only himself in the mirror when Dracula is behind him which insinuates that Count is essentially a part of himself and that realization alone causes disintegration and madness. LucyLucy is a changeable character, the only one in the novel who was both a human and a vampire, and her physical and mental state fluctuate throughout the story constantly - she is excited and restless; she amuses herself with the erotic possibilities of three husbands and loves the attention of men. In the strict Victorian era, she is conditioned to dissociate her sexual feelings and strong libido from the conscious mind. Her unorthodox desires can find their expression only in altered states of consciousness - trance, sleepwalking and dreams, all of which precedes the Count's attacks.Lucy is not at peace with herself - she has somewhat a hysterical personality structure with deep internal conflicts. During the day she has to have the innocence and purity that are mandatory for women in the era, but during the night, her restlessness, erotic side of the mind, sensuality come out. She has an ego/persona imbalance between the real identity and social role she has to play and is ultimately lost between the night and day, conscious and unconscious self. In Lucy's case, Dracula is a negative undifferentiated Animus - seducer, even though the relationship is never shown and she has no memory of him or his form. Dracula is a catalyst for change to the possession of the unconscious- her conscious ego is afraid of change - she is overwhelmed by unconscious content - the weak ego cannot assimilate the content of the shadow without being overwhelmed by it. Lucy has no positive masculine figures to counter Dracula's erotic animus - only men who are sexually interested in her. Mina is for her Logos - reason, judgment, differentiation - when Mina leaves her there is no more objectivity or escape from unconscious eros. Being a divided character, with a weak ego, she succumbed and gave up conscious control, allowing the vampire/unconscious/shadow to dominate. Her ego was challenged beyond what she could handle and instead of the assimilation, it was shattered and destroyed.Lucy ultimately experiences triumph as a sexualized vampire, takes the blood of more men, a being of flesh, the underworld and the night- Eros, Id and the shadow have won and taken over her identity, destroying her conscious will and persona. “She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth—which it made one shudder to see—the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. ”MinaMina had by far the most successful encounter with Dracula. Mina has mental balance, so she can compensate and integrate unconscious content presented by a vampire attack. More integrated than Lucy, her sense of self is well developed and she is well adapted to reality, more firmly rooted in society - she is engaged, has a teaching job, learns new skills that allow her to maintain an active role even when attacked by Dracula. She wants to be as equal as possible to Jonathan, she is practical, active, brave, and has shown that she can deal with uncertainty, fear and distress with firmness. Opposite to Lucy that has a passive role, waiting for a savior, Mine has an active role throughout, she determines her destiny with her abilities. Her sole source of meaning is not sexuality and men, even though she is accomplished through a stable male-female relationship.Mina has a balance of Eros and Logos; feelings and reason; she is a character who has already progressed on the path of individuation, of formed identity.“That wonderful Mrs. Mina! She has a male brain ... and a female heart. ”Although she has done most of the work of synthesis of knowledge about Dracula, she is forced by men to stand aside- they no longer need her, she is too valuable to expose her. Her ability, intellect, curiosity, all of it must be repressed to fulfill the role of an obedient Victorian woman. Mina is forced by men to play the role of damsel in distress, of a fragile passive woman with which she does not resonate at all. "Even though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I couldn't say anything but accept their chivalrous care for me."When Mina has to suppress the authentic parts of herself, her psychic balance is endangered. There she meets her shadow in the Count. But, in Mina's encounter with Dracula, she does not stay unconscious - Van Helsing hypnotizes Mina and extracts the important pieces of information from her subconscious that help to capture and defeat Dracula. Through the conscious exercise of the rational, in a process similar to psychotherapy, awareness of the unconscious manages to outwit and control the unconscious instinct of Dracula. Mina manages to keep her ego identity but pities and understands the Count - and in him her own dark and destructive parts that she partially integrates (she is the only character that drinks Dracula's blood). In a way, she feeds off her shadow, but in the process destroys Dracula's aspects that cannot be integrated, that are ultimately overpowered by positive aspects of masculine figures in her life. She is, what Campbell calls, the master of both worlds, she has authentic individuality that is connected with the unconscious, even in the darkest realms, but also she remains functional and integrated into society that gains from her maturation. Even though the novel is called Dracula, Dracula is not a central figure. Dracula lives in each one of us representing the otherness- parts of ourselves that are not allowed by society, drives, impulses and wishes that we cannot admit to ourselves. What Dracula is, depends on us - the dark egoistic sadist that feeds of suffering and others' life force, the seductive demonic lover, the wise old man. The sexual libertinism and unbridled violence, emotional, grotesque, irrational - Dracula is in complete contrast to the man of reason and morality, yet so infinitely attractive to him. Dracula is also Trickster that will appear when we pretend to be something we are not, to unveil hypocrisy and show our true face. Above all, Dracula is elusive and indestructible, the symbol of transformation and initiation into another kind of existence and the constant reminder that if we are looking for Dracula's darkness, we will find it in our own reflection.

This period is all about mystery, fear and of course the supernatural and even a bit of romance. Published in 1897, Dracula is the most famous of Irish author Bram Stoker’s twelve completed books, and takes the form of an epistolary novel, written as a collection of diary entries, letters, telegrams and newspaper articles, written by several narrators who also serve as the novel’s main characters. Such a style adds a great degree of realism to the plot and offers its reader a number of different view points of the events that take place therein.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ The story opens with newly qualified solicitor, Jonathan Harker, as he visits Count Dracula in Transylvania to provide him with legal assistance as he prepares to buy a house in England. And while Harker is initially enticed in by Dracula’s charm, it quickly becomes apparent that he is, in fact, a prisoner at the vampire’s castle and narrowly escapes with his life.Meanwhile, sinister events begin to unfold in England; a ship crashes on the shore of Whitby, and Lucy – a friend of Harker’s fiancé Mina – dies of mysterious blood loss. And while as readers we are fully aware that the ensuing events are happening under the spell of Dracula, the characters’ ignorance of his power adds an element of suspense to the plot as it slowly unfolds.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ Hugely atmospheric and brilliantly written, Dracula fuses restrained, quiet horror with creepy eroticism and a Victorian backdrop. With Bram Stoker’s natural flair for suspenseful writing and the epistolary style that lends itself so well to the text, it is easy to see why Dracula is often heralded as one of the best gothic novels ever written.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ I was also genuinely surprised at the erotic and gory imagery contained in this novel. This was certainly not the prudish Victorian literature I was used to reading. The epistolary form creates a peculiar build-up of suspense within the narrative.

167700957	** spoiler alert ** I've grown to appreciate this more with age - especially as I've put more distance between myself and the time I studied Dracula at school. But I still think it's overrated. Dracula isn't nearly scary enough, Jonathan Harker is a wet mop of a protagonist, Mina is annoying and the best character [spoiler alert!] gets killed less than halfway into the book. .
4130643478	Over the years I've somewhat fallen out of reading classics, which is a damn shame as I typically enjoy the process of reading them even if I don't end up liking the book. In an effort to kick-start the process of reading them again on a more regular basis, I've decided to go with one I should have crossed off my list decades ago given my love of horror.Dracula has been portrayed in so many different ways from all the different forms of media. He's been suave, sexy, violent, heroic, demonic… he's even been cute and cuddly. (Picture of my actual copy of the book along with one of my daughter's plushies)So, it was an interesting experience, going back and seeing Stoker's original intent. So what was he?I think he could best be described as an ever present entity who is only seen for around 30 pages or so. He has such little "screen time" for a title character and yet he's felt in every scene. He's a predator, something lurking in the shadows the entire time and the reader is just watching as those around him slowly piece together what he's doing.I can only imagine that when this originally came out in 1897 that it caused a stir. While slow paced, it's frequently disturbing even by today's standards, particularly some of the scenes early on in Dracula's castle and some later when our heroes are staking out (pun intended) a graveyard. (view spoiler)[Also, yeah, Dracula's brides totally eat a baby... at least that is strongly implied. (hide spoiler)]I confess, I'm not personally a big fan of epistolary novels. I majored in English and have read quite a few, but it's not a style that usually appeals to me. As silly as this may sound, I find I like it most in where it incorporates modern technology, such as chat logs or texts as it creates a multi-media aspect through current means of communication… as such I actually love what Stoker did. He did 1890s equivalent, as there are diary entries, telegraphs, newspaper articles and even transcriptions of phonograph recordings. In fact, one of the most fascinating aspects of the novel to me was how prominent then current technology was, with descriptions of light-bulbs, recordings, blood transfusions and rapid transit through trains all aiding our heroes. This is in many ways a book about science conquering the dark and superstitions (though as Van Helsing is quick to note, sometimes superstitions have their reasoning and should be taken into account with science). It's a rather fascinating look at the topic.My biggest surprise while reading (other than some of the frightening content), the thing that I will no doubt take away with some awe is that the book contains a cowboy. Yes, a cowboy. He's not a joke character, he actually serves a purpose… but there's a random cowboy in the vampire hunt. I recently while looking this up on the internet (to find out if anyone was a shocked by said cowboy as me and WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL ME) found this gem and will close my review with it:5/5 stars["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
1763580579	The vampire novel...the vampire that haunts out collective experience...a classic. Always see Bela Lugosi when I think of Dracula: one of the images that have been branded into my mind - so many memories of Halloween connected with Dracula type costumes - this book has made such an impression on so many people - highest recommendation.

Either way the terrified Mr. Hawker escapes , as if his life depended on it, not caring about those eerie wolves , surrounding the building and disappears... Back in "civilized", safe England his fiance Mina on vacation in Whitby, is visiting her sick, good friend Lucy Westenra, she becomes very pale too, almost like ill Lucy who is losing blood, why ? Dr. Seward with the help of Dr.Van Helsing an expert in little known diseases, gives her Lucy, four transfusions, still she becomes weaker, and small punctures are spotted on Miss Westenra's neck, what can they be?

76183030	Almost every author will fall into one of two camps: the active, and the reactive. The active author looks at the world around them and decides to write about what they see. They sit down and think: "I'm going to write a story, the subtext of which will provide my analysis of Victorian sexual mores". They then construct the story around this theme, creating characters to show different aspects and constructing a plot which moves from general observations to specific insights.Then there are the reactive authors. These tend to sit down to write a story without necessarily thinking about what the characters or story mean. Reactive authors will often still touch on the same themes as active authors, but instead of deliberate explorations, we get the author's gut reactions.In the Late Victorian, one of the ideas that concerned many authors was the 'New Woman', who was a proto-feminist: she was active, controlled her own life, considered marriage a partnership instead of a master/subservient relationship, took pleasure in her own sexuality, and took part in traditionally male activities, like science, writing, and carousing.Since Stoker is a reactive author, we do not get a deliberate analysis of the New Woman: we don't get a view of how she came about, of what drives her or differentiates her, or of what she might mean for the future of sexual politics. Instead, we get the reactive view: a certain thrill in the sexual freedom she represents, but in the end, she is condemned for being frightening--she is too difficult to control, she does not fit in.The reactive view is nebulous, switching back and forth, never getting to the heart of the matter. Stoker does not include the New Woman because he understands her, but because she troubles him. This applies equally to his other recurrent themes: foreign vs. British identity, homosexual and other non-familial desire, scientific innovation, and ancient mysticism.He includes these things not because he has some insight to reveal to the reader, but because they are concepts he cannot cease bringing up. They are a part of his world, and so he depicts them. These depictions shift and change with his reactions: homosexuality is first condemned, then pitied, then hinted at enticingly, then condemned again.It is one of many things which Stoker desires to speak about, to puzzle through, something which both intrigues and unsettles him, which he cannot help but return to whenever he considers humanity. It is a habit formed by deep emotional connections and powerful memories. He is lost somewhere between the grotesque fall of his former friend Oscar Wilde and his lifelong worship of Wordsworth, whose celebration of homosexuality was an open secret.Unlike Byron, Shelley, and Polidori, who inspired Stoker's tale of Gothic horror, Stoker is not certain what he thinks about the world he lives in. He does not have a philosophy or a voice, he is just a man trying to make it through a world which he cannot come to terms with.It is not an ideal situation for his characters, who must shift with the movement of the tides. The only consistent personality is Van Helsing, who is too ridiculous and overblown to get lost in the text. The others all move from one extreme to the other: now subverting Victorian ways, now upholding them. The longer the story goes on, the more they become a collection of names, losing any distinct identity. Though Stoker works in broad strokes, the characters are not unsympathetic or stupid, but they are there to serve the story, wherever the winds may list.Dracula, himself, is mostly absent: our heroes try to create an identity for him with their fears and assumptions, but none are very certain that their assumptions about Dracula are correct. They point out several times that their own violent hunt for the count is not terribly civilized or sane, and may not be any more justified than Dracula's own need to feed. What carries them along every time is their own self-righteousness--but coming from such scattered, unsure characters, it is hardly a convincing justification.There is a lot of elbow room in reactive books, because there is no distinct heart to the story, no central philosophy driving it--which appeals to a certain breed of academic: Stoker touches upon most of the controversial topics of his day, but never creates any definitive view of them. Things are truly open for interpretation, and the critical works in this collection take full advantage.First Dracula is homosexuality, then he represents a gender switch, then he is the capitalist monopoly which destroys fledgling British Utopian Socialism--and certainly, all these are unconscious influences on Stoker, but it is too much to say that Dracula is any one of them. He is a collection of fears, insecurities, desires, and popular topics thrown in by Stoker as they came to him.Most of the critics seem to recognize that Stoker was no great thinker--just an average, well-off, educated man with some talent for flowing prose. This being the case, it feels silly for them to declare one argument or another fundamentally sums up the text. Many think a declarative style lends strength to a somewhat vague analysis, but as a New Historicist, I prefer the critic give the author only as much credit as seems warranted.That isn't to say there isn't a great deal to be gleaned about the period from Stoker--indeed, his insecurity often reveals much more than he intends--but we can only learn as much as we might from talking to the average man of the period, as opposed to studying the expert opinion of an 'active' author.As a story, it is entertaining, and the reader may be surprised at how different the original vampire is from the one we are now familiar with. There are some aspects of the book that I think would be interesting to see in film, but there are many other winding, long-winded passages which are better left out. The book goes rather slowly in the middle, maintaining roughly the same conflict with no new developments, and we are reduced from several different epistolary views to a more-or-less streamlined, neutral voice as the bland heroes grow more uniformly alike.The conclusion is rather abrupt, and we never do get to a real showdown to match all the buildup of Dracula's many-faced evil, but this makes sense. Since Stoker is unsure precisely what he means to get at with his book, we can hardly expect him to create a viable, satisfying conclusion. The ending is certainly final, but it is not a decisive advance upon the book's themes, but a safe retreat to normalcy.As all horror authors must, Stoker reaches for his own fears and insecurities to drive his story along, but he is not a self-searching man, so when he comes to the time for an ending, he instinctively rejects all of the vague things which unsettle him, trying to do away with them suddenly and violently, as befits a man who is out of ideas.And so, the showdown the story deserved is absent--we never face Dracula in his own domain, under his own power. His dark castle remains shut up, and the mystery of who he was and what motivated him is left unconquered. Due to one of the many small errors which permeate Stoker's text, even the conclusion can be called into question.Though we are assured that life has returned to normal, that things are now safe again for the straitlaced Victorian family--that homosexuality, feminine power, foreign influence, and pagan mysticism have all been destroyed--the assertion rings hollow, because Stoker never deals with any of these fears. He never manages to meet them with the right tools to overcome them. In the end--and as we always suspected--Dracula is simply too pervasively perverse for the upright Victorian man to kill, because as an average Victorian man, Stoker simply doesn't know where to strike. Like too many conservative thinkers, he has cultivated his own naivete by avoidance until he cannot comprehend how to oppose his enemy.So Dracula lives on in our world, growing in power, his vast array of subversive powers getting stronger with time. He withstands the full force of Victorian ideals, then outlasts them, watching them crumble. It shouldn't have been surprising: as Byron, Polidori, and Shelley all hinted, it wasn't Dracula who was the myth, but Victorian morality. It isn't heroic to oppose sex and death, it is tragic: strike them as hard and as often as you like, then watch them rise again. And so Dracula does.
4720824222	4.5 stars.I’m happy to explain why Dracula does not quite reach a 5-star high for me, but there are minor spoilers.Surely, I’m not the only reader out there who wrongly assumed this Gothic fiction classic was written by a Transylvanian and that the plot takes place in Transylvania? It starts there, but the majority of scenes are set in Britain, and it was written by an Irishman, Abraham (Bram) Stoker.Dracula has been on my ‘to read’ list for nearly a lifetime. Thinking back, the delays had quite a bit to do with thinking the trailers and stills from movies appeared silly and unconvincing. I imagine this novel is likely far superior to any adaption. And talking of imagination, the author invited me to let mine run amok. He knew how to create fear and atmosphere. He achieved this in an epistolary novel – with letters, diaries and reports - and I really liked that format.I recently watched an episode of Joanna Lumley’s travel series around the UK and nearly fell off my chair when she visited Whitby, a North Yorkshire seaside city with ruins of a moody 7th Century monastery-come-abbey, and reported these were referenced in the story. This certainly sparked my interest and bumped Dracula up the list.I really enjoyed this read, slightly marred by a couple of lulls in the text that dragged. There was a bit of sexism too, you know, the ‘Off you go now, my dear, while the men retire to smoke cigars and talk men’s business’ type of sexism, but I was forgiving given it was written in the Victorian era, and that’s not to say there was no gutsy female who came to the fore.I think it’s now time to give the 1992-film, with Gary Oldman in the lead, another chance.
6682202191	I spent 2 weeks finally finishing this book. This novel pioneered the vampire genre. I've watched the film adaptation twice, but since I heard that the film made significant changes, so I decided to read the novel.This novel's narrative is quite clever, pieced together through diaries, letters, and other materials from various characters involved in the story, yet the information doesn't overlap, which is quite skillful. The film retains the diary's structural role; I remember the beginning (after the introduction of Dracula's history) starts with Jonathan's diary. However, in the film, the diary only serves a structural purpose – and of course, it can only serve a structural purpose.In the novel, Count Dracula doesn't appear as a vampire until the latter half, while the film reveals his identity in the prologue. I can't say which treatment creates more suspense, because in both forms of experiencing this story, either the reader or the viewer must already know the ending. If you only watch 1 or the other, both treatments can generate enough suspense. Perhaps the form of "suspense" in film and in novels is fundamentally different.As a novel, Dracula is obviously more convoluted than "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (the 1992 film adaptation), so much so that I started to get anxious even though I knew the ending. However, while the film simplifies many of the plot points, it strengthens one element – love (I think this weakens the film's horror essence to some extent but can attract a certain audience who likes romance films, and can be seen as a strategy to win at the box office). In the film, Mina's past life is Dracula's lover. 400 years ago, Dracula went to war to resist the Turks, and when he returned victorious, he found that his lover had drowned herself after hearing rumors of his death. Therefore, her soul could not enter heaven, and in anger, Dracula pierced the holy image and drank the blood that flowed out, thus becoming a vampire. This is not in the novel, and the novel doesn't even mention how he became a vampire.400 years later, he sees a photo of Jonathan's fiancée, Mina, and finds that she looks very much like his lover, so he goes to London to find his love again. Clearly, the strengthening of the love element gives the evil image of Dracula in the original work a more sympathetic side. In the novel, Dracula drinks Mina's blood and then forces Mina to drink his, to turn her into one of his kind. This scene is described as a terrifying and sad image; in the film, however, Mina willingly asks for it, and even halfway through, Dracula says, "I love you too much to let you lose your soul and become like me," but Mina says, "Make me what you are..." At this point, I dare say that Dracula is almost a positive image in the my eyes. Of course, films are more modern than books, and perhaps in the eyes of modern people, there is no absolute boundary between good and evil.By the end of the film, I even involuntarily forgot that vampires are evil, and instead admired him for his escape in that chase. But when I read the book, it was the complete opposite. In fact, by the end of the book, I was no longer reading word for word, but directly associating what I read with the images from the film. I remember a parallel montage of a sunset, a carriage, and Mina in front of the castle, creating a sense of tension. But when watching the film, I was nervous for Dracula, while when reading the book, I was nervous for the hunters.These 2 different expectations also led to two different endings. In the novel, the hunters catch up to the carriage before sunset and destroy Dracula, a satisfying ending (although one of the heroes is sacrificed, it doesn't affect the novel's happy ending). In the film, although Dracula is seriously injured before reaching the castle and it is almost sunset, Mina rescues him back to the castle, and he also realizes his sins and returns to God, so Mina pierces his heart, allowing him to rest in peace. Perhaps some would still consider this a tragic ending, but to a certain extent, it is also a comforting ending, and perhaps it also implies some of the director's religious beliefs? I don’t know.I think this interpretation in the film does not deviate from the original thought (except for the part in the film where Van Helsing mocks Lucy for having intercourse with a vampire, which is not consistent with the original work), but instead clarifies the implicit thoughts in the original work and makes the characters more full. It can be said to be a relatively successful adaptation - at least, it allows me to patiently read the original after watching the film.4.5 / 5 stars
6916185237	✩ 4 stars ✩ “Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.”For a classic, this was a surprisingly accessible and engaging read. This story is told largely through the reading of journals and letters written by several different characters. Each character has a very distinctive character voice and while all of the characters were well developed, I found that I much preferred some characters to others. Like many readers, I had a particular fondness for Jonathan Harker’s portion of the book. This portion of the story is also set in Dracula’s castle and featured Dracula more prominently, so it’s no wonder many readers favor this part of the book. Unfortunately, it was also the beginning of the book and the middle 50% or so felt a bit dull and repetitive by comparison. Since Vampire lore is so commonplace these days, there were many moments where this became a very frustrating read. I wanted to scream at the characters as they continually left Lucy alone at night knowing that something was happening to her as she slept. Part of the issue was that they were trying to be proper I think, but if they had just kept someone standing vigil, the final outcome might have been very different. Realistically, it would take a lot for me to conclude that Vampires were the cause of my problems, but as a reader it felt like it took them forever to put the pieces together. The most surprising thing about this book was how dopey Van Helsing came across. 😅 The way his lines were written to include his accent likely had a lot to do with it, but his character was also much older and more academic than the badass vampire slayer you see in the movies. Granted, I haven’t actually seen Dracula, just the Van Helsing movie, so he may have been more accurately portrayed in other films. 🤷🏼‍♀️The following quote encapsulates my biggest takeaway from the story. “…the world seems full of good men--even if there are monsters in it.” There were four male characters apart from Dracula who were featured heavily in the story that all seemed like VERY good and brave men. I have never wanted to see what a character looked like more than I want to see Lucy. How did she manage the win the hearts of 3 great men AND the interest of Dracula?! She must have been a total babe. Gotta say, if I had been in her shoes, my choice would definitely have been Quincey! Sadly I think men like that only exist in cowboy romances these days. 😁I would love to pick Bram Stoker’s brain to learn if he believed that gender roles should be so firmly established the way they are in the story. Both women were clearly very capable, but they were treated like damsels in distress rather than intelligent adults. It was ironic how many times the women ended up in harms way as a direct result of the men trying to protect them. If he were truly a chauvinist, I think Stoker would have just written the women as naive or unintelligent, so I’m choosing to believe that Stoker was poking fun at assumed gender roles and limitations. I had a lot of fun with this one! Despite a slow middle, this was a great read with a really solid ending. Definitely a must read classic. 🖤“No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.”✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼Pre-read: October classic pick!

849792213	No man knows till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.This seems to be my first time reading Dracula, and I LOVED IT. I say "seems" because I swear I've read it before. However, that would have been ages ago. Or a byproduct of seeing 10 million different Dracula interpretations before the age of 20. o.O So it was fresh and relatively new to me. I was surprised by the twists and turns. I thought I would be able to reasonably predict the whole plot - and I couldn't.Let's talk about major issues, because review space is limited and I believe everyone knows the basics of the plot. Evil vampire, blood-sucking fiend, lives in Transylvania, moves to London, and fucks with the wrong people. (Did NOT know who he was fucking with, as Riddick would say. LOL) You know the drill. Besides having 217 status updates - with many quotes continued in the comments, I had copious notes and also a running list of vocabulary words that I learned from Dracula. :)I very much enjoyed this reading. :D You can tell from all my status updates and huge pile of notes. Sometimes I'd only read one or two pages in a day and just let them simmer inside me. I've been thinking about Dracula non-stop for about 11 days now. *evil grin* It was a perfect October and/or Halloween read. I had this absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous leatherbound B&N edition. Yum. It's been my constant companion these last 11 days. I didn't leave home without it! LOL I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.MAJOR ISSUESWe seem to be drifting to some terrible doom.FEMINISMAh, ha ha ha. You knew I'd start with that, right? :DThis book is full of explicit sexist bullshit. Non-stop explicit sexist bullshit. Yes, I understand that this was 1897. Please don't lecture me in the comments about presentism.I was surprised the sexism was so very blatant. There is a lot of talk - by all characters, male and female, about "brave men" and "weak, poor women who are just frail creatures" who "can't stand strain" and should be shielded from the world and from the truth. Men are praised for being strong and brave and if a man is particularly brave, he's described as all man.Let's talk about Mina Murray-Harker."Mrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places for our time; but it is not place for a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her."At first I was very angry with Mina. She holds sexist myths and sexist beliefs very close to her heart. She even blames Eve and the "apple" for women's "inherently sinful nature" at one point! I hate that shit. Disgusting.I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit - I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths - so I handed him the shorthand diary.Both Mina Murray-Harker and Lucy Westenra are complete angels: good, sweet, pure, kind, "motherly" beings whom men (almost literally) worship. Lucy gets three marriage proposals in one day, and even the men she rejects swear undying devotion and fealty to her. Mina fares just the same. Every single male who comes into contact with these women prostrate themselves and declare their undying devotion. And not in a sexual way! There's a need to have a woman to protect and champion and care for. And she provides her services as a stenographer, a shoulder to cry on, and a cheerful and beautiful presence to boost the men's spirits.Now, you may think that this book is a sexist piece of shit, but I was actually surprised and impressed with Mina. She's smart, capable, and features prominently in the book. Van Helsing praises her as having "a man's brain." She drives the coach, she figures stuff out before the men do - and she wants to be included in everything.Which brings me to another point. A very large subplot here is the interaction of Jonathan Harker and Mina. Once privy to Jonathan's every thought and experience, Mina's position shifts when the other men encourage Jonathan to stop talking to Mina about vampires and the work they're doing to hunt Dracula completely, leaving her in the dark and cutting her out of their once coed meetings. Jonathan does it, convinced it's the right thing to do, although he feels inside that it's wrong somehow. This is the man who, just before proposing to Mina, states that there should be no secrets or hiding between spouses and gives her his journal so that she knows all. "Wilhelmina... you know, dear, my ideas of trust between husband and wife: there should be no secret, no concealment."He knows somewhere deep inside that making her an outsider in this is deeply wrong. But he does it - and is punished severely for it.After that, Mina once again resumes an active role in the groups activities - as it should be, her fighting by their side. Even though it may have been unintentional on Stoker's part, I was overall pleased with how things turned out, especially for a book written in 1897.Is this a feminist text?NO. It is not. I don't want to give you the wrong idea, it is NOT. But how about I file it in the 'not as bad as I thought it was going to be' category on the topic of feminism? :)BAND OF BROTHERS On thing that I loved about this book was the men and the men's relationships with one another. You have Jonathan Harker - Solicitor who is the first in the novel to encounter Dracula. I thought he was a complete ninny and think Mina could have done much better in picking a husband, but oh well.Quincey P. Morris - Texan. Rich. Very fond of guns and shooting things."I believe in my heart of hearts that [Morris] suffered as much about ----'s death as any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed."Dr. John Seward - Psychologist who runs a mental asylum. Smarter and more badass than either Morris or Harker or Holmwood. Practical and straightforward. I always thought Mina should have married him instead of that nitwit Jonathan Harker. Ugh.Arthur Holmwood - Rich. Engaged to Lucy Westenra."What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me, and I shall do it. My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her."Or what about this gem:LUCY: I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well.An appetite like a cormorant. Welp, that's a new one.Arthur says I am getting fat.Arthur can go fuck himself. What is this, James Bond? Fuck that shit.Dr. Abraham Van Helsing - Badass name for a badass man. This was the only man I was interested in in the book. Intelligent, ruthless, gets shit done - but is still a kind, loving and polite person. He's a lawyer AND a doctor AND a vampire expert AND an expert at breaking-and-entering. This is who I would be making eyes at if I were in London at the time. ;) Good with consent, has a strong conscience, and has lots of experience. ;) Very attractive. ;)ANYWAY. What is my point of listing all these men?So you can discuss whether they are a.) nitwits or b.) worthy of kissing?LOL No. I mean, obviously I am always going to discuss that. But, the reason I'm bringing up the men here is because of their close friendship. Holmwood, Morris and Seward served together in Korea, for crying out loud.Excuse me?Yeah, I know. It makes the book sound more like it's taking place in the 1960s or 1970s than the 1890s, but that makes it all the better. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The name's Plissken. Stoker making these men brothers-in-arms (in more ways than one!) adds a fine nuance to the novel. People who have fought together have a unique bond and trust with each other, and I think that makes these men in particular teaming up again once more - all the more potent. They unconsciously fall into their old rapport and positions, and, led by Van Helsing, make a stellar team.Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good.MONEYAs I was reading this book, I was thinking "rich people." *shaking my head* Then I was so surprised and pleased when Stoker chose to mention this not ONCE, but TWICE.Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money. 88%and Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used! I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour. 93%So it IS mentioned. Being brave and willing to die fighting vampires is one thing, but it's almost worthless without money for supplies, transportation, and constantly bribing people for information the way our heroes had to in this book. I'm so proud of Stoker for bringing this up. Good job!BLOOD SUCKING VS. TRUE HORRORAnyone who knows me knows that I hate HATE erotic bloodsucking. However, I did not find the bloodsucking in this novel to be erotic at all, and therefore was undisturbed by it. I know that in 1897 this would be considered very erotic bloodsucking - but in 2015, to a pretty jaded vampire-fiction-reader, not so much. This was a relief to me, I was able to read the blood-sucking sections of the book without being too grossed out. It was more like animals feeding than anything sexual.However, this book DID surprise me by making me genuinely horrified and grossed out. But it wasn't the bloodsucking, it was the vampire killing. I have a real thing, apparently, against mutilating and desecrating dead bodies. The scenes of "we're going to open up her coffin! We're going to stake her through the heart! Then chop off her head, cut out her heart, and stuff her mouth with garlic!" were making me ill. It was very horrifying and gross to me. I felt like they were violating the corpses and violating the very sanctity of death by doing this. I was rather shocked, I had no idea I even thought sanctity of death was a belief of mine until they were gleefully beheading cadavers. o.OAnyway, that was the true horror of the novel in my eyes. Not the vampires.CARNAL VS. PURE; LUCY & MINA VS. THE BRIDESOh my gosh, Stoker never shuts up about women being either pure angels of mercy or carnal wanton beasts that need to be destroyed. Madonna/whore complex TO THE MAX in this novel. Very frustrating. When the Brides approach the men seductively, the men are all over that. Jonathan is ready to strip down and party when the brides show up kneeling in front of him and licking their lips seductively, and Van Helsing himself is not unaffected. They totally want those women on some level. But if it's Lucy or Mina or a woman who is supposed to be their "pure wife and mother stereotype," the men react with revulsion and disgust when lustful tendencies are shown. Good luck on Jonathan and Mina ever reproducing if Jonathan's reaction to Mina coming on to him is one of horror and revulsion. He probably only wants to have sex with all the lights off and missionary position, ten-thrusts-and-then-roll-off-her kind of thing. Probably with his eyes screwed shut the whole time. Poor Mina. I told her not to marry that ninny! And Lucy, goodness gracious. She was a bit sexual even as a "pure maiden," fantasizing about marrying three men at a time and shit, thank goodness she (view spoiler)[died (hide spoiler)] before having sex with Holmwood. I can't imagine she'd be happy in that marriage. He called her fat - what an asshole!And you are going to be SO SICK of the word "voluptuous" by the end of the novel. Stoker uses this word 12 times in this novel and it gets seriously annoying. Sometimes it's multiple times on the same page. It's as if he doesn't know of another word to describe a sexual woman. Which is weird, because to me this more describes a certain body type than an attitude, but I looked it up in MW and it says that one meaning of the word is "giving pleasure to the senses," so I guess it works.I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman, and there is naught in common. They are devils of the Pit!I shall not remain alone with them...MODERN STYLEThis book is very readable, quotable, and enjoyable. I'm always rather hesitant to pick up a book considered a classic and written over a hundred years ago, but Stoker delivers. He uses a lot of modern wording and phrases, the book absolutely speeds along - it's never boring and he doesn't get bogged down describing the scenery for 10 pages.That being said, I learned a lot of new words reading this: it was a veritable treasure trove of vocabulary. Here's my list: Foreknowledge, missal, unpunctual, prepossessing, perforce, patronymic, saturnine, demoniac (not demonic, demoniac!), militate, fastness, outrider, fain, expostulate, adduce, agglomeration, defibrinate, trituration, presage, remonstrate, enjealous, impressment, decoction, quondam, ingress, stertorous (this is another word Stoker is hugely fond of. He uses it 9 times - get used to seeing it!), intestacy, tussock, interstice, pabulum, importunate, adduce, lugubrious, arrogate, and odium. Wow! Look at how much richer my vocabulary is now! I am a rich woman! Yay! *does a vocabulary dance*I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death.PRO-CATHOLICBless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort?This book is strongly pro-Catholic and Catholic doctrine and beliefs are presented as the truth. Notice Van Helsing's liberal use of the Host (Wafers) - he hands them out like candy. Holy water. Etc. Even noted Protestants like Harker are wearing crucifixes by the end of the novel. I don't think this is proselytizing, exactly, but there's definitely a strong Catholic flavor and undertone to the novel. "A sensible Protestant (Harker), how can he be caught up in all this primitive Catholic superstitious madness?!!?" is pretty much the entire first third of the book. Of course, Catholicism wins the day and provides Harker and his friends with the strength and tools to defeat evil, so ending the novel on a strong pro-Catholic note.Some people claim that this book is anti-Semitic - I don't feel that it is. But one of the most enjoyable things about Dracula is that everyone reads the book differently and brings their own interpretations and experiences to the text. It's been claimed as anti-Semitic, queer, homophobic, sexual, anti-sex, feminist, anti-feminist, etc. etc. etc. Dracula and the people who fight him can be stand-ins for anything and anybody, apparently. Choose your own hot points after reading the novel. :) It's fun. You can see I chose "feminist" and "pro-Catholic," but - much like the Bible - you can twist and turn the text until it says what you WANT it to say. ;)He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils.DRACULA IS A PETTY ASSHOLEI expected him to be the King of Vampires, not someone who enjoys playing mind games with poor nitwit Jonathan Harker. I mean, some of the things Dracula did in this novel were obviously just because he enjoys messing with Harker and tormenting him. *rolls eyes* Not exactly strong, commanding, Children-of-the-Night behavior, IMO.ATROCIOUS DIALECTPlease beware that whenever any of the gang is talking to someone from the lower classes, the person will speak like this: "These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts an' barguests and bogles an' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an' dizzy women a-belderin'. They be nowt but air-blebs! They, an' all grims an'signs an' warnin's, be all invented by parsons an' illsome beuk-bodies an' railway touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to do somethin' that they don't other incline to do."I have close to zero tolerance for this shit. I find it HIGHLY annoying. And what's even worse is that Stoker doesn't have to do it. Van Helsing speaks in a very distinct and "foreign" type of English, and yet Stoker never resorts to breaking down his words into atrociously spelled ones. Here's an example of how Van Helsing speaks:"He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect... He has the strength of many in his hand... He can transform himself to wolf... he can be as bat... He can come in mist which he create... He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust.. He become so small... He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire..."In this way, Van Helsing's distinctive voice was made clear - I could ALWAYS tell at once if he was speaking or narrating, but yet Stoker never writes out his accent in some bizarro way. I wish he'd done that for the working-class side characters! Tl;dr - SO EXCELLENT. I am so happy that I own a copy, it is going to be read and re-read over and over again, I can tell you that. I was so happy and pleased with this book - and it's so hit-or-miss with classics that I had no idea what to expect.I highly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in it."Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?"..."Would that I were!" he said. "Madness were easy to bear compared with a truth like this."Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Happy Halloween! :)P.S. Dracula has a MUSTACHE. How come that's never shown in any film?!?!?!?!P.P.S. Hey, I found something REALLY COOL. This is a National Geographic feature on a Romanian people living in the Carpathians and in the Transylvanian Alps etc. They are called the Csángó people.Here at this site:http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm...You can read about them, see pictures of them, and hear them sing. It will really give you a more vivid and nuanced picture of what Jonathan Harker is seeing and hearing while traveling through Transylvania.Make sure to check out the left side in order to access Photo Gallery and Multimedia (where you can hear them singing!). Also, Map.Oh, and if you click (also on the left) Sights and Sounds: Experience life with Romania's Csángós - you can watch videos explaining stuff to you. WOW!
1284819311	No sé cuantas páginas tiene la edición original, ya que leí una versión algo resumida, pero, según la introducción, decía que sólo habían sacado unos pequeños detalles y los más difíciles de entender para que la lectura no se haga tan pesada.Dicho esto, la historia en sí es excelente y muy original para la época. Me imagino a la gente de antaño leyendo esto a la luz de las velas. Si yo fuera ellos, estaría más que un poco asustado.La historia en general ya se conoce, es cultura general. Ya sabía el final y todo, pero quería leerlo todo con detalles para saber el inicio, el medio y el final de todo Drácula.El principio, con Jonathan como gran protagonista me gustó mucho, el libro es muy rápido y dinámico, describiendo al Conde con lo justo y necesario. Cuando él deja de escribir y se centra más el los otros personajes, el libro, a mi parecer, se pone lento y pesado, mientras organizan la matanza y todo eso, de repente sentí que el libro daba vueltas en círculo. Planearon la "estocada" final durante muchas páginas, pero cuando lo mataron la historia duró media página. Meh.Algún día me gustaría ser tan culto y listo como Van Helsing, pero lo que no me gustaría es ser tan religioso como él, a veces era un poco patético todas las veces que, no solamente Van Helsing, sino que todos, mencionaban a Dios y cosas religiosas demasiadas veces, como que no pega eso con Drácula just saying.En general, libro bueno, un clásico. Vale la pena el tiempo. Historia bastante intensa sobre todo para la época.
2169342413	Dracula is still a real and living presence in modern Romania, and there is nothing like reading Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula in Romania during the month of October. During the day, the landscape of the Transylvanian plains seems tranquil, almost pastoral. One sees a shepherd and his dog guiding the sheep to their grazing place, or notices the red tassels that adorn the horses pulling the carts of Romany farmers; and the chief danger seems to be from the aggressive drivers that one sometimes encounters on Romanian roadways. But then, as night begins to fall, one feels a chill that seems to go deeper than anything that the autumn air alone could cause. One remembers the travel-book warnings that one should not drive in rural Romania after dark. When one finally reaches Sibiu or Brasov, just as the sun is setting, one’s eyes are drawn to the stern, austere beauty of the town’s churches. And just what was that little creature winging its unsteady way among the lighted steeples?...Bram Stoker no doubt knew that he had a good story idea in mind. He conducted diligent research regarding the historical Dracula, who died in 1477. The bloody-minded Vlad Țepeș or “Vlad the Impaler,” who as voivode of Wallachia committed unspeakable cruelties on a regular basis, more than earned his nickname as a Drăculești or Dracula, Romanian for “son of the dragon.” So outrageous were the atrocities committed by Vlad Dracula that he became linked with the abundant vampire folklore of Eastern Europe; and 400 years later, Bram Stoker gave Dracula to the world.The power of Dracula starts with characterization generally, and with the title character in particular. Please allow Stoker to introduce him, as he is first seen by Jonathan Harker, a young English solicitor whose business it is to help facilitate Dracula’s plans to move from Transylvania to England:Within stood a tall old man, clean-shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of color about him anywhere. His face was a strong – a very strong – aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils, with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.So powerful is Dracula as a character, from the moment we first see him through Jonathan Harker’s eyes, that the character can vanish from the novel for almost 250 pages, seen only as a bat, a wolf, a wisp of fog, and yet still loom over the novel as a dominating presence. From his initial conversations with Harker, Dracula shows his pride in his aristocratic heritage, his disdain for the common people (he would not want even to sleep in the same earth with commoners). It is as if Stoker is suggesting, mischievously, that the move from titled lord to vampire is not a terribly long leap. The impeccable manners that Dracula displays on a first impression give way quickly to an unconcealed disdain for human beings generally. Once he has successfully arranged to be transported from his Transylvanian homeland to England, one has a strong sense that a struggle for the future of humanity has begun.Other characters are sketched with comparable skill. In Jonathan Harker, we are given a quite suitable protagonist: a smart and likeable young man, imprisoned in Dracula’s castle, who cannot pit his power against Dracula’s and therefore must make good use of his wits if he is to survive his fearful captivity. Later in the novel, it is painful to watch Harker aging before his time as the vampire attacks the woman Harker loves. Van Helsing, the great scientist whose areas of expertise extend beyond the natural to the supernatural, likewise draws the reader’s interest and admiration (though Stoker’s attempts at rendering the character’s Dutch-inflected English sometimes seem forced).I have always found unfortunate those readings of the novel in which Lucy Westenra is the “bad” girl who succumbs to Dracula’s advances because she “deserves” such a fate, whereas Mina Murray-Harker is the “good” girl who survives the vampire’s depredations because she is somehow more “virtuous” and more “deserving” of a happier fate. Nothing could be further from the truth. Both characters are likeable young women, and Lucy is guilty of nothing worse than being popular (her receiving multiple proposals from multiple suitors on the same day is a bit much for us to be asked to believe). Because Lucy is a good person, it is all the more heartbreaking to watch the long struggle for her life and soul between Van Helsing and Lucy’s four suitors on the one hand (all of whom, at one point or another, donate their blood in an effort to stop Lucy’s long, slow decline toward death) and the implacable Dracula on the other. A couple of unfortunate twists of fate make the outcome of Lucy’s struggle all the more tragic. And then one senses all the more strongly what is at stake as the vampire turns his diabolical attentions toward Mina.I have not yet talked about the importance of the novel’s structure. Stoker unfolds the grim story of Dracula through journals, newspaper clippings, letters, diaries, phonograph recordings, and the like. This epistolary, documentary quality contributes to the novel’s power, and somehow makes the novel’s bizarre events – e.g., a ship sailing into a northern England harbor with a dead crew – seem more real.There are good reasons why this is one of the best-loved and most influential novels in all of literary history. If you have never read this novel, read it; if you have read it, read it again. Dracula will wait for you. He has all the time in the world.
4704525017	Yesterday I finished reading Bram Stoker’s Dracula. I enjoyed reading this with a group of friends on Goodreads, and we all finished yesterday. What’s more, we all started on May 3rd, and hundreds of people around the world did the same. In case you think that 6 months is a long time to spend on one novel—and that this is a peculiarly specific time frame to boot—I should probably explain.If you have read Dracula, you may well remember that it is an epistolary novel. It is made up of letters, diaries, telegrams, and newspaper clippings, and every part of it has a date. The whole story happens between May 3rd and November 10th, and over one year (apart from a sort of coda, which is 7 years later). Have you guessed yet?We have all been part of “Dracula Daily”, a project which sorts the book into strict chronological order, and sends the daily entries by email as they happen. It is a kind of “real time” read. So if someone is incarcerated in a castle for months, you have the authentic sense of the time passing, and might know what the other characters are doing on exactly the same day. You also might read one short 3-line telegram one day, and yet another day have 4 or 5 long diary entries to read, sometimes telling the same events from multiple points of view. There are also days—a fortnight upwards was I think the longest—when nothing happens.Does it work? Yes, quite a few of us read the whole novel this way. But I have to say that it is impossible to compromise. Back in May, I thought I would wait to see which part of a chapter was due that day, only to find that some parts were skipping ahead, some paragraphs apparently missing and others backtracking—according to the written order. In fact all the text is there, but I had to stick to the prescribed content. This means that I would now like to read the novel again, in Bram Stoker’s original order, perhaps in a couple of years’ time.As I said, it adds a kind of authenticity to the feeling of time passing, following the true timeline, but it means that it is impossible to judge how well the novel itself is paced. As well as the incarceration I mentioned, another part which seemed far too slow was time at the other end of the novel spent on a ship. Other sections which I might have preferred to dwell on, felt a little rushed.On the other hand, I think a slow read benefited this novel. I tend to like horror stories to inculcate fear slowly; to chill and terrify me by making me conjure up demons in my own imagination. The master of classic creepy tales for me is M.R. James’s insidious and atmospheric prose, rather than Edgar Allan Poe’s explicit descriptions. Of Dracula, M.R. James specifically said that it was:“a book with very good ideas in it, but—to be vulgar—the butter is spread far too thick. Excess is the fault here”.I can see that compared with M.R. James’s subtly understated chills, Bram Stoker’s prose could seem overblown. Reading the novel slowly, seems to decrease the sense of melodrama, and increases the excitement and threat factor. And it has to be acknowledged that Dracula is the novel which has spawned the plethora of vampire fiction for ever afterwards. There were other incarnations earlier, from 18th-century poetry, through Sheridan Le Fanu’s tale “Carmilla”, but it’s a fairly safe bet that anyone you ask to name the most famous classic vampire story will say Dracula, (which was written in 1897). The two words have become almost synonymous.Dracula simply has to be a 5 star story. And if you too would like to try reading in “real time” starting next May, it does seem to be an annual event, if you google: “Dracula Daily”.

2456958211	"Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told".Creo que es la tercera o cuarta vez que leo Dracula en toda mi vida. La primera vez fue cuando era muy pequeña y recuerdo haber tenido pesadillas bastante góticas y espeluznantes en las que, tras huir por el risco en el que se encuentra el castillo del Conde, me veía acorralada por los lobos y la neblina en la punta del abismo mientras muchos murciélagos volaban y se recortaban en el cielo con la luz de la luna. Era una sensación tan aterradora y real que nunca la voy a olvidar. Ahora, muchísimos años después, acepté el reto de leer Dracula en inglés... ¡y vaya odisea ha sido! El inglés antiguo y, sobre todo, el inglés antiguo de las personas de clase baja era absolutamente insufrible y me costaba horrores descifrarlo. Pero bueno, dejando este pequeño percance con el idioma de lado, puedo decir que, igual que todas las veces anteriores, Dracula es una novela que nunca para de asombrarme. El ambiente y la tensión gótica que crea Bram Stoker es maravillosa: desde los primeros diarios de Jonathan Harker al principio del libro cuando está atrapado en el castillo de este misterioso conde, pasando por las cartas de Mina y Lucy, y terminando con los diarios de los valientes hombres que, arriesgando sus vidas, se proponen como misión acabar con un ser oscuro y poderosísimo en el que no creían antes de verse enredados en sus garras. Este es un libro largo, que se merece una banda sonora perfecta y terrorífica de fondo y que, además, demanda ser leído en la oscuridad de la noche, pues ese es el momento en el que, inmerso como estás en la lectura, los límites de las páginas se borran, la niebla fantasmal recorre las calles y el aullido de los lobos deja de estar únicamente en tu imaginación. Bram Stoker creó a un personaje icónico, demoníaco, retorcido y que no ha sobrevivido a los siglos únicamente por su inmortalidad, sino por su inteligencia y astucia. Este es el vampiro mejor recordado de toda la literatura y se ha ganado ha pulso su puesto allí. Si quieren embarcarse en un viaje por Transilvania, por los oscuros parajes de bosques indómitos, por habitaciones prohibidas y por las pasiones y miedos más profundos del ser humano, lean Drácula.

2154915064	Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend. This classic novel never fails to both amuse and mystify me. I always enjoy Stoker's atmospheric writing and the epistolary nature of the story. However, the first half of the book tends to entertain me significantly more than the second half. It's the creep factor, the element of mystery, that draws me into the story initially. I had a considerably more enjoyable time reading the edition of the book annotated by Leslie S. Klinger, which brought to my attention just how many glaring inconsistencies can be found throughout the book. I confess that these inconsistencies eluded me on my first read. While the annotated edition of Dracula enlightened me to many intriguing little details that can be found in the book, I wish it would have gone into greater depth about the symbolic sexual implications of the text, which is arguably one of the most intriguing elements of the novel, especially in light of the fact that it was first published in 1897. While not my favorite classic, I'm glad to have read it, and I can't deny that it makes for a fun read during the spooky season. Note: If you love Dracula, be sure to check out The Beetle by Richard Marsh.

917835552	"Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, and with such unknown horror as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams." I finally got around to reading Dracula, and I'm so glad I did! It's a story, and a character, that has woven its way into our common consciousness in such a profound way that reading the original material is a fascinating game of spot the difference.I enjoyed the epistolary structure of the novel and the many characters we got to meet, though by far and away the best was Van Helsing, a man so melodramatic, amorous, and loquacious that I immediately fell in love with him, while simultaneously wishing he would learn to be a little more concise in his communication.By modern standards, this novel is teetering on the edge of being too repetitive and wordy to be considered "tightly plotted" or "well-paced." Still, none of us choose to read a book written over a century ago because we're in search of something that conforms to modern writing conventions.If you're a fan of classics, the supernatural, and theatrically romantic characters, I'd recommend you give this one a read!Trigger/Content Warnings: blood, death, animal death, medical content You can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | TikTokYou can join our book club over on Patreon...PBB Book Club
5817252448	“No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.” Love, mystery and a permeating sense of dread. This classic vampiric tale offers a theatrical and tense endeavour through the tropes of gothic fiction. Each element of this book, from character to setting, is crafted to fulfil an unsettling image- a dark environment shrouded in horror and turmoil. From the description of soil, to water, to fog and snow, each setting draws on the sensory experience of the reader. The epistolary manner of story telling enables a deep connection with the characters; a way of entering their perspective, their interactions, their thoughts. With each person’s writing slowly being infiltrated by the count’s appearances, it’s a captivating way of building a villain-like character that maintains a mystery and sense of foreboding subtlety- like an overarching presence manifesting into various forms of reality. My only drawback with this book was the pace, it lead to some portions of the book feeling particularly slow- but not a drastic flaw, especially with the emotional strength of the end. A particularly eerie read, and a classic worth the time.
3627885972	Cada vez que me animo con un clásico de la fama y el reconocimiento que tiene Drácula, voy con pies de plomo. Siempre temo encontrarme con un texto denso en exceso. Por eso la primera grata sorpresa que me he llevado con Drácula es que se lee super rápido. Incluso me ha parecido sencilla la forma de Stoker de contar las cosas. Sencilla en el buen sentido. Además, a lo largo de los años he ido acogiendo muy bien el formato epistolar y Stoker lo manejaba perfectamente. Aunque eso implique algún fallo en mi opinión que explicaré más adelante.La novela me ha sorprendido para bien en muchos sentidos. Y es que, pese a tener mucha fama, también tiene muchos detractores que a lo largo de los años lo han encontrado aburrido y pesado. En mi caso, me ha parecido muy entretenido y en ningún momento me han pesado las casi 600 páginas que tiene mi edición, de hecho he disfrutado de muchos puntos.El primero de ellos para mí es la ambientación. Refleja ese algo tétrico durante toda la novela, sin decaer y eso es digno de mención. Otro punto maravilloso es todo lo relacionado con el folclore del vampiro, que pese a que haya cosas que a día de hoy ya nos resulten obvias en el mundo vampírico, Stoker le da una realidad a todos estos detalles, que en la época serían toda una novedad. La invisibilidad frente a los espejos, la vulnerabilidad ante el ajo y los signos religiosos, la estaca en el corazón y la decapitación, la transformación en murciélago o el control del tiempo y otros animales, son parte de lo que todos conocemos a día de hoy del vampiro, pero en ese momento tuvo que ser una sorpresa. Aunque incluso yo, muy fan de los vampiros, me he llevado algunas sorpresas.Además creo que, aunque no fue Stoker quien escribió primero sobre los vampiros y hay relatos anteriores y buenísimos como Carmilla o Manor, si considero que Stoker lo hizo algo más complejo. Eso sí, el detalle de encontrar vampiros sexualmente ambiguos o con diferentes sexualidades en relatos anteriores y luego ver que Drácula solo se digna a morder mujeres, me ha parecido algo anticuado y, probablemente, reflejo de la personalidad de Stoker. Luego hay dos cosas que me han chirriado mucho y que por eso me hacen sentir que el libro no es redondo. El primero es que Drácula sale entre poco o casi nada. "Persiguiendo a Drácula" hubiera sido un título más apropiado. Quizás el formato epistolar daba poco juego a que saliera más, pero eso no justifica un final en el que sale tan poco. Es interesante ver como Drácula siempre está al acecho y como eso crea ese clima tenso, pero un poquito más podría haber salido el señor. Unas cuantas páginas más al menos. La otra cosa que me ha molestado mucho es la reiteración continua, prácticamente en cada página, de comentarios machistas donde se considera a la mujer mentirosa, poco digna o débil, siempre siendo comparada con la bondad y la fortaleza masculina. Sé que mucha gente piensa que todo se justifica con la época en la que escribió el autor, pero yo soy muy contrario a esa idea. Uno puede ser adelantado o conservador en cada época y dentro de su contexto. Evidentemente no puedo esperar que Stoker nos hable de la mujer abogada o la mujer presidenta, pero ¿es capaz de imaginar vampiros que controlan lobos y no puede imaginar a una mujer fuerte disparando un arma y no desmayándose cada 30 segundos? He leído autores anteriores a Stoker o que escribieron en la misma época, que ya contemplaban la situación de la mujer y el derecho de esta a su independencia. El libro es de 1897, casi siglo XX, no del siglo catorce. Y repito que el problema no es que hubiera algún comentario machista, eso siempre te lo esperas con algo más clásico, es que hay cientos. Sobre todo por boca de Van Helsing o Lucy. Y me indigna incluso más si pienso que, precisamente, para mí el personaje más interesante es Mina. La que se me antojó más inteligente desde el principio y que de alguna manera sirve de guia a los demás y podría haber sido un personaje mucho más fuerte si los señores con los que iba no la hicieran de menos cada dos páginas. Y me ha dado algo de rabia que Stoker creara un personaje así de interesante y la dejara a medio camino. Ni siquiera las adaptaciones cinematográficas han tratado bien al personaje de Mina. En definitiva, y pese a las cosas que no me han gustado y me han aguado algo la fiesta, he disfrutado mucho Drácula. Bastante más de lo que me esperaba. Me ha parecido que se leía solo y que sirve de cimiento para la figura del vampiro, que aunque no era nueva, él terminó de darle forma y eso es de valorar. Así que lo recomiendo mucho. Tengo ganas de leer alguna otra cosa de Stoker, y creo que será "Cuentos de medianoche".
2146073262	«Η εκδίκηση μου μόλις άρχισε. Πέρασε στους αιώνες και ο χρόνος είναι στη δική μου μεριά».Ο Κόμης Δράκουλας με τη γοητευτική και οδυνηρά ιδιόρρυθμη προσωπικότητα είναι ένας ευγενής, γόνος αριστοκρατικής και πανίσχυρης οικογένειας, υπηρέτης του μακάβριου και του σκοτεινού. «Καλώς ήρθες στο σπίτι μου! Μπες ελεύθερα. Έλα με ασφάλεια, και άφησε λίγη απ' την ευτυχία που φέρνεις». Η μορφή του, ψηλή, λιγνή, υπνωτιστική, σατανικά ζοφερή και ικανή για αποτρόπαιες και ανατριχιαστικές πράξεις. Ένας χιμαιρικός εφιάλτης, αιμοβόρος, αιμοσταγής, αδιανόητος εγκληματίας, αδελφός της ματωμένης σελήνης και γητευτής λύκων, εντόμων και τρωκτικών. Μια παρουσία υποβλητική αδίστακτη και ανυπέρβλητη απο ανθρώπινες δυνάμεις, εφορμά τα μεσάνυχτα απο τον εγκαταλειμμένο και ερημωμένο Πύργο του με σκοπό να παρατείνει την κυριαρχία του και να διατηρηθεί αιώνιος...πίνοντας αίμα. «...άκουσα σαν από πολύ χαμηλά στην κοιλάδα τα ουρλιαχτά πολλών λύκων. Τα μάτια του Κόμη έλαμψαν, και είπε: «Άκου τα, τα παιδιά της νύχτας. Τι μουσική που κάνουν!» Βλέποντας, υποθέτω, κάποια έκφραση στο πρόσωπό μου που του φάνηκε παράξενη, προσέθεσε, «Α, κύριε, εσείς οι κάτοικοι της πόλης δεν μπορείτε να μπείτε στην αίσθηση του κυνηγού.»Εξουσιαστής της διαβόητης δυναστείας των Νεκροζώντανων συμβολίζει την δύναμη της ονειρικής ιδιότητας, της μεταμόρφωσης του υλικού σε άυλου καθώς και την απόλυτη ένωση του φαντασιακού τρόμου με στοιχεία πραγματικότητας. Η σκιά του σκεπάζει για αιώνες τα απόκρημνα βουνά της Τρανσυλβανίας και τα ίχνη του είναι για πάντα αποτυπωμένα στις Ρουμανικές Άλπεις. Το συγκεκριμένο μυθιστόρημα του Ιρλανδού συγγραφέα Bram Stoker δεν είναι ένα βιβλίο τρόμου και φρίκης,είναι η επιτομή του γοτθικού λογοτεχνικού είδους. Σίγουρα πρόκειται για ένα έργο κλασικό, αξεπέραστο, απέθαντο σαν την αρχετυπική φιγούρα του Δράκουλα που το διαφεντεύει. Είναι ένας μυθικός θρύλος, ένα εφιαλτικό ταξίδι με προορισμό την αιώνια ψυχική καταδίκη και υποτέλεια στα απέθαντα πλάσματα που ηδονίζονται πίνοντας αίμα και υπακούν στα σαδιστικά ένστικτα του αιματηρού ηγεμόνα της επίγειας κόλασης. Εκδόθηκε το 1897 ως επιστολικό μυθιστόρημα με ημερολογιακές καταγραφές των χαρακτήρων που πρωταγωνιστούν. Η δημιουργία του κράτησε επτά χρόνια. Είναι αποτέλεσμα μελέτης και έρευνας των ευρωπαϊκών λαϊκών παραδόσεων και δεισιδαιμονιών και τις ιστορίες για βρικόλακες απο όλο τον κόσμο. Απο εκεί και έπειτα κατέκτησε την πρώτη θέση στην καρδιά αμέτρητων ανθρώπων ως το πιο συναρπαστικό πρότυπο σκοτεινού τρόμου μέχρι και σεξουαλικής απόλαυσης βαμπιρικών προδιαγραφών...Ο Κόμης Δράκουλας ενέπνευσε θεατρικούς συγγραφείς, λογοτέχνες, κινηματογραφικούς παραγωγούς και σκηνοθέτες και θα συνεχίσει να το κάνει με απίστευτη επιτυχία. Το νεκρό και σάπιο χώμα έγινε το κρεβάτι του τέρατος με τα κόκκινα μάτια,τα μυτερά δόντια και την τεράστια δύναμη. Το σατανικό του χαμόγελο γοητεύει μεθυστικά τα θύματα που αφήνονται ανενδοίαστα στην αφαίμαξη τους προς τέρψη του τέρατος που ασκεί αφύσικη έλξη κάθε είδους. Μοναδική απαντοχή των θυμάτων η Θεϊκή παρουσία και αρωγή που μπορεί να απομακρύνει ή και εξοντώσει το Κακό. Κάπως έτσι ο Κόμης Δράκουλας κατέκτησε την έννοια του αδιανόητου και κατά συνέπεια την αιώνια μυθοποίηση. Μπροστά σε αυτό το μεγαλείο δε γίνεται να σταθείς σε λεπτομέρειες και να κατακρίνεις με τη λογική και ορθολογική εκτίμηση αυτό που η ανθρώπινη φαντασία πλάθει και παρουσιάζει. «ΦΙΛΕ ΜΟΥ,— Καλωσήρθατε στά Καρπάθια. Σάς περιμένωάνυπόμονα. Σάς εύχομαι καλόν ΰπνο γι άπόψε. Αύριο στίς τρεις φεύ-γει ή άμαξα γιά τή Μπουκοβίνα· Εχει κρατηθεί μιά θέση γιά σάς.

3328913629	Okay so, turns out this book isn’t so bad. I even enjoyed reading some parts. But it also dragged. A lot. The ending was good though. There was also lots of sexist remarks. Was Stoker simply portraying society or did he think women do have lesser brains than men? I’ll need to read some analyses on this book regarding this subject because I don’t know honestly. He’s probably just very sexist. However, I did like that Mina played an important and smart role in the story. I won't be writing a comprehensive review, I wouldn't even call this a review but more like a mess of opinions on this book.The sexism and masculine society got on my nerves. I know this book is old but some comments were too much. For example, if everyone had strong blood like x character, America will prosper for sure. Wth?? Also, Van Helsking assumes women are inferior to men and praises Mina's brain that is almost a match for smart men. There were so many. While I turned blind sometimes or even laughed at how silly the comment is, some got under my skin.Do I regret reading it? No. I have read a lot of vampire stories, now I can but of course I've read the original! And some parts were interesting. But the details are too much. I really do not need to know about the weather every time. Nor every single detail about a walk. Harker’s chapters were interesting but Mina's were slow at first. This book had lots of ups and downs, one page-turning chapter or then we get a snore fest diary entry. It's also completely written in a diary style (sometimes magazine articles, etc.). Therefore, we mostly had the story told from the first-person perspective. Word for word. They do not sum up the day. They retell it chronologically as it's the present. While I think using this perspective helped, on the other hand we had some repetition. For example, a character had to say they tried this and failed. Tried again the same thing and failed. Tried the same exact thing and failed. Yes, they retell each time with details even if happened on the same day instead of summing it up "we tried repeatedly but failed". That was very annoying. But hey, thank God all those folks love to keep a diary or we wouldn't have had a story!Nonetheless, I believe this book is better than Frankenstein (which bored me to death) but it's also pretty long. My edition had 612 pages but with large writing. Is it worth it? It honestly depends on you. I wasn't planning on reading it but my friend insisted so I borrowed his copy. I was no way going to buy this nor read the ebook. If you're not a fan of classics then no. If you are, then for sure. If they're usually hit or miss for you (my case too), I suggest you read some reviews and decide accordinly.

She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, ..."Oh ... the brides!I'm finding this review difficult to write. It's been a long time between blood red drinks with this novel. I've read it once before, many years ago, and my response to re-reading it is to drop it from 5 stars to 4.Stoker's writing style is an uneven mix of brilliance and tedium. His plot development ranges from magnificent to flawed. His drawing of characters is basically two dimensional and I have to search hard to find examples that provide a greater depth. (I.e. characters are either all good, or all evil, with little in the way of shades of grey. Noting that Renfield, is by his final actions, one of the few characters that shows dimensionality....)I know some who found the beginning slow. I would disagree. I found the initial journey of Jonathan Harker to Dracula's castle and his subsequent trials and tribulations there to be brilliantly composed narrative. There is a slow and steady progression from hints to warnings to threats to manifest risk of death and worse than death enslavement of the soul to forces beyond darkness.The visual depictions of Dracula descending the vertical walls of his castle and the spooky manifestation of Dracula's brides is effective and affective writing.The log of the Demeter is another masterwork of the slow advance of impending doom. The hint of a threat that grows with each night as one by one the crew disappear. Until it is a ghost ship that comes to land in Whitby, Yorkshire. This is manifest brilliance.To say that Lucy Westenra cops it in the neck would be a bit trite. Her eventual fate left me inspired to write a Haiku.Bloofer lady prowls.Moonlight reveals blood stained hearts.Hammer strikes - I'm Free!Mina Harker (the primary hero of this story as she is the one who has to confront the greatest risk and persevere beyond it) is the brains (on multiple occasions) behind the operations of the Van Helsing Vampire Hunting Club. Mina gets left behind while the boys go galavanting about Carfax looking for evidence of Vlad and when the obvious happens - no one notices. It's a raging plot flaw (i.e. Major hero gets in trouble because everyone is suddenly as thick as two short planks) I hadn't noticed this in my earlier read. I must be getting pickier about such things as I get older...I would also like to note that Stoker's use of a psychic connection between Mina and Dracula is strikingly echoed in multiple ways by J.K. Rowling with Harry and Voldemort. I think also for the same purpose, as the psychic link is used to move the narrative forward in both Dracula and the Potter books. Is J.K. a fan of this book?Some things I didn't like which got in the way of the telling.The use of vernacular by anyone not in the Van Helsing Vampire Hunting Club such as "'ere like tha'..." Was positively grating.Van Helsing's speech was mostly annoying for the same reason as we are asked to 'appreciate' that this learned dutchman can't speak grammatical English...On the question of writing the whole novel in epistolary form (letters, diary notes, log books, etc). I think it works very well for this novel. However, something could be missing. What I would like to see is a great big diary written by Vlad Dracula...The bottom line: I love the story but I don't always love how it was written. Would I recommend it? Yes. Well worth reading for those moments of brilliance that have carried this story for more than a century.Strongly recommended (despite the 4 stars), '4 Classic Gothic Vampire Thriller stars.'PS. For any who are interested, a neat little conversation occurred over at Castle Dracula about who would be best to cast for a new modern, faithful, adaption of this story for a big budget movie.
7662809424	-Classics -Horror, Fiction, Fantasy -This isn’t the story of how Dracula became what he is. This is basically a compilation of diary "notes" from different people who were ultimately affected by the famous vampire we all know in one way or another. It intertwines everyone, forcing them to come together to find a way defeat him, basically. -I don't think it's a read for everyone because it can feel quite long due to the repetition in the book, BUT that also depends on the edition you decide to read, because some are shorter than others or have simpler vocabulary. I think I read the long one (490 pages), and it’s not that it was difficult, but it did feel a little slow. -There are several protagonists. I think each one contributed enough, just some more than others. And the only thing I found unbearable was that they all seemed like they were all kind of SUPER CLINGY IN SOME WAY to the female protagonists. I get the husband of course, but the others seemed so random lmao, it was a bit funny cause it felt like they were all in love at a certain point with them. And I’m absolutely sure that really wasn’t even the author's intention, but just the way I see it haha -I wouldn't say there are “extra” or secondary characters. We pretty much only get to know about the main characters. -Well, the romance is nice, I guess. It's already established, but it's sweet. -Stand-Alone-I almost had a heart attack of pure surprise (I’m not complaining, Dw) because I thought the very beginning was going to get kind of gay. HAHAHA the book tricked me. -I didn't lower the rating because of the repetition because, well, I don't have a master's degree in classics, so I can’t really say that the genre itself is repetitive, but I had somehow see it coming. -Obviously it's not scary LOL, but there were scenes that gave me the creeps to visualize. It just- EEEK A DAGGER THROUGH THE HEART YEAH I’LL PASS ON IMAGINING THAT. -“I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air.” 🫶-Plot: 4/5 -Characters: 3.5/5

1807661347	All plodding plot, which can sometimes be amusing. This is my second reading. Perfect Gothic thriller fun for the summertime, but not for any brilliance of style. No, I’m reading it again for the grisly action, for the scene setting. Like when Jonathan Harker finds the Count asleep during the day on a box of dirt. What! There’s much use of over description, which was just the convention of Victorian writing in general. But it makes the scenes at times excruciatingly effective.I like the scene in which the death ship careens during a sudden blow into the harbor of Whitby, Yorkshire. The ship is empty except for the dead captain/helmsman (tied to the wheel) who’s conveniently secreted the ship’s log in his pocket in a glass bottle. (!) This log reveals the madness onboard the ship during its voyage from the continent. All fiction is to some degree preposterous. Dracula certainly has it share of shameless audacity.

6752250	If I was Bram Stoker I’d remake the old Melanie hit – remember this one?Look what they done to my song, ma look what they done to my song well it's the only thing that I could do half right and it's turning out all wrong ma look what they done to my song Which the Count would have sung asUite ce au facut sa ma cantec, mamaUite ce au facut cintecul meu e singurul lucru care i s-ar putea face jumatatedreptate si e intorcandu-se in toate regula mama uite ce au facut sa ma cintecReviewing Dracula in this twilight age of loin-thrustingly pert young vampettes and vamparistas is like extolling the sexual allure of Clara Bow and Jean Harlow. Dracula was the first “grown up” book I ever read. Hey, 12 year old PB, good choice! It made my pulse pound and my skin horripilated madly. But I do not think this would happen to a modern reader. Poor old recycled Dracula, rewritten, cartooned, parodied, Buffyfied, sliced, diced, crimped, carved, and ripped off in every one of a million ways, undead you were and undead you still are, if only as a Halloween costume and a footnote to an essay about Stephanie Meyer.Given all of that, and given the high Victorian never use one word where a bucketful will do style of Mr Stoker, I still think it's worth five of my stars. It seethes with that wonderful sexual hysteria the Victorians loved writing about, from Wuthering Heights to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. They couldn't mention anything directly so they did their best with linguistic nodding and winking, and much mention of purity, and chasteness and its opposite unchasteness. Bosoms were okay, anything beneath waist level was absolutely not, until you got to shapely ankles and well-turned feet. So you can see they were gagging for it, and the writers were ferociously finding metaphors for writing about sex; and Bram Stoker found vampires. The strong sick pall of sexual dread which suffuses Dracula like a London pea-souper is seduction. This is what Stoker wants to write about - seduction and sexual enslavement, or, why do good girls fall for such very bad men? The Count is the embodiment of all seducers. He comes around at night and he gets into your fiance's bedchamber, so naturally you have to drive a big phallus right through his heart. I get that. Bram Stoker is practically frothing about all of this. Bram Stoker invents most of the trappings of vampires right here and throws in a handful of the most outrageous scenes (three beautiful young female vampires in the dead of night overheard squabbling about who should get the baby they have got in the bag they're holding up; three men all giving one woman a blood transfusion using only a rubber hose; the Count scrabbling up a castle wall as fast as a man could run, all great stuff).I say read Bram Stoker, read Let the Right One In, and step delicately around Twilight.
2537864503	BookTube channel with my awesome brother, Ed - The Brothers Gwynne My personal BookTube channel - William Gwynne “Once again...welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring.”Dracula is a classic for a reason! But it also does not feel like a classic...I have no idea how it has taken me this long to pick up Dracula... but I have finally done myself the favour of picking this up. It delivered on everything I wanted and more. As my brother would say, Dracula delivers so well that it would be a great postman.I expected a great dose of gothic horror, and I got that aplenty. I love the initial setting of Dracula's castle, the gradual building of tension and doom, and the role of the "creatures of the night". I also expected gripping, immersive prose. And I also got that. From the very beginning Dracula was dripping with atmosphere because of Stoker's writing style and the choice to convey this story through "letters". These letters of a myriad of characters tied together to weave a tapestry of dark, gothic brilliance.But, I was also shocked (in a good way). Dracula does not feel like a novel written over 125 years ago. The chapters are usually short and sharp, and we jump between different PoV characters in a way reminiscent of much modern fiction, as these combined craft a fast-paced story that provide real drive to the plot. The convergence of characters as their needs align was also excellent and was another manner in which Dracula felt ahead of the times. This was also far more brutal and dark than I expected (silly as that may sound). Many of the Victorian writers, whilst dealing with dark themes, shy away from the brutal details of the moment. Stoker does not, as he reveals the dark actions of Dracula often with striking detail.“..the world seems full of good men - even if there are monsters in it.”But, despite the ways in which I was shocked, Dracula is still a story of 'Good V Evil'. And I loved that. Our central characters have horror and suffering inflicted upon them, but they find in different ays the strength to fight back against a creature almost impossible to comprehend. There are also morally ambiguous characters, such as Renfield. In the adaptations I have watched his character has been let down. I thought he was a superfluous, almost irrelevant character beyond the opening. But he contributes so much in this book, and offers discussion into redemption, what madness means and the importance of meaning. There was far more subtle thematic exploration than I initially expected, and it does go beyond the simple 'Good V Evil', despite that remaining at the heart of this story.I am so glad I have finally picked Dracula up. I believe it will now be my favourite pre-20th century classic. I was hooked from beginning to end. Whilst the modern reader in me yearns for a slightly more dramatic ending, that is but a minor gripe in what is an exceptional story that has lasted the test of time. This drips with atmosphere, transports you into the minds of the characters, and sinks its teeth into you, refusing to let go.5/5 STARS
20520995	(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)The CCLaP 100: In which I read a hundred so-called "classic" books for the first time, then write reports on whether or not I think they deserve the labelBook #13: Dracula, by Bram Stoker (1897)The story in a nutshell:To best understand the storyline of Dracula, it's important to imagine yourself as an actual citizen of 1897 when the book was written, and then imagine one of your friends positing the following question: What if some of the horrible monsters mentioned in old Gothic literature from centuries past were actually real, and what if one of these ghouls decided one day to move to your hometown? Because that's the entire premise behind Stoker's original plotline, something easily forgotten in our modern times when even the 1800s look quaint and historic; that the real thrill of this novel to his contemporary fans was not just the premise of a blood-sucking vampire living somewhere in the bowels of eastern Europe, but that this vampire decides to pack up and move to 1897 England instead, mostly because after hundreds of years of killing, the people of his section of the world have finally caught on that he's an inhuman monster. That's what takes young goofy lawyer Jonathan Harker at the beginning of the book out to the wilds of rural Transylvania; it's his firm that's helping this reclusive member of the aristocracy transfer property and money and the like into the English legal system, and as the most junior member Harker is the one assigned to actually transport all the finished documents out to Dracula's spooky family castle in the middle of the Carpathian Mountains, for his final okay and signatures.Ah, but the Count turns out to not be exactly what he seems, with creepier and creepier experiences finally culminating with an attack on Harker's life, the stealing of Harker's information by Dracula, and a whirlwind sea voyage to the pastoral English coastal village of Whitby, where Harker is originally from and where his plucky fiance Mina patiently awaits his return. (All of this, by the way, is told not through a traditional omniscient narrator and standard dialogue, but through a whole series of written documents such as diary entries, letters, newspaper clippings and more, coincidentally making Dracula one of the best-known examples of what's called an "epistolary novel.") As you can imagine, chaos soon ensues in Whitby, as the Count takes up residence at the local abandoned Medieval abbey on the edge of town and starts turning various young sexy girls into zombie slaves through repeated erotic bloodletting rituals, with no one there understanding what's going on because of course none of them living in a world yet where vampires are a well-worn cliche.Thinking that his beloved has fallen under a rare disease, one of these Whitby residents calls in a friend of his from Amsterdam, the Indiana-Jones-like exotic-disease specialist and world traveler Abraham Van Helsing, who quickly realizes that this quaint seaside resort town in fact has a vampire on its hands. This leads to a whole series of action sequences, fight scenes, chase scenes, a trip back over to eastern Europe, and all kinds of other details I won't spoil; needless to say, things come to a "head" (ha ha) back at Dracula's Transylvanian castle, leading all to a nice old-fashioned "good guys definitively win" ending, perfect for the moralistic times in which Stoker lived.The argument for it being a classic:Oh, there are all kinds of reasons to argue for Dracula being a classic; just for starters, it's a fine example of the Romantic/Victorian novel, not to mention one of those projects in the 1800s to first help establish the so-called "weird" genre (eventually leading us to such modern subgenres as horror, science-fiction, goth and more). It's also one of the first books, fans claim, to present a truly complex and unpredictable main female character -- Mina Harker, that is, who it could be argued is much more the hero of this tale than the globetrotting vampire-killer Van Helsing -- although none of this should really come as a surprise, given that author Bram Stoker's mother was the famous early feminist Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornely. Plus, it's one of the most adapted stories of all time as well; according to the Internet Movie Database, for example, over 100 films now exist with vampires as their main theme, with close to 650 movies now at least mentioning vampires in one way or another, all of them single-handedly because of Stoker and this particular novel*. And if all this wasn't enough, fans argue, the book remains a surprisingly thrilling one to this day, and surprisingly scary for a story that is now 111 years old and counting.The argument against:Like many Victorian novels, critics claim, reading the 400-page Dracula anymore is bound to make you think of that line from The Simpsons, when Homer meets British comedian Ricky Gervais: "You take forever to say nothing!" That's not necessarily bad, just that it makes the book hard to enjoy as a simple piece of pleasure-reading; like many other books now reviewed for the CCLaP 100, it makes Dracula historically important and a book that genre fans should definitely tackle, but not necessarily a "timeless classic" that everyone should make their way through at least once before they die. Not to mention, there's that little matter of the 750 films that have now referenced vampires throughout the decades, the thousands of books and television episodes, the countless Dracula costumes worn to endless Halloween parties; when the details of a book become this much an ingrained part of our entire culture, critics claim, it makes trying to read the original book an exercise in frustration, in that you already know in your gut just about everything that's going to happen (not to mention every single surprise Stoker laid for his then-unsuspecting 1800s audience). Again, it makes the book no less important from a historical and scholarly point, but unfortunately just not a book that the general populace should feel like they need to tackle themselves.My verdict:So let me mention this before anything else, that after four months now of regular Victorian-novel consumption because of this essay series, how surprisingly more modern and complex Dracula is than many of its contemporaries; it is a much more readable book than many others written in the late 1800s, featuring characters that sometimes are much more complex than usual for a moody Romantic tale, and with a shocking level of gore that has been quietly excised from the Dracula legend over the years by Hollywood and others. (For example, in the original novel they not only would pound stakes through the hearts of vampires to kill them, but shove garlic down their throats and cut off their heads, not for any supernatural reasons but to simply make sure the stupid things were actually dead.) Now, that said, as a fantastical novel from the Romantic period, Dracula certainly does ramble on in overly flowery language a lot more than we 21st-century readers are used to, and especially that self-satisfied blowhard Van Helsing -- yes, we get it, ya Dutch freak, you're a vampire expert, now shut up shut up shut up! And it certainly will hold almost no surprises to the modern reader either, at least regarding the fact that Dracula is a vampire and what exactly a vampire is (a major point of suspense to Stoker's original audience, in that Dracula isn't revealed to be a vampire in the novel until halfway through). Still, though, all in all the surprising strengths of this book ended up outweighing the expected weaknesses, which is why today I'm confidently declaring Dracula a classic that is definitely worth your time and attention.Is it a classic? Yes*Now, that said, please be aware that the vampire myth itself existed long before Stoker wrote about it in Dracula, simply that it was an obscure legend little known outside of the academic community; like I said at the beginning of this essay, that was Stoker's entire point, to take a supernatural concept from old Medieval literature and transport it into the "modern" world. In that sense, then, you can see how such projects from our times like Interview with the Vampire and Buffy the Vampire Slayer are actually a lot more faithful to Stoker's original premise than you might've realized.
1516608631	“Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make.”This iconic quote illustrates the unfathomable depth of Dracula’s evil. Not only does he have terrible taste in music (wolf metal, anyone?), he is keen to inflict his awful taste on poor Jonathan Harker who is already regretting his visit to Dracula’s castle. If the novel was set in the present day the Count probably would have put on “Yoko Ono’s Greatest Hits”. “Listen to her. Nice Japanese lady. What music she makes.”. At which point Jonathan, usually slow on the uptake, would have run away screaming.One of these days I will be able to resist the urge to write stupid intros to my reviews. Today is not that day. Dracula is one of the most frightening horror novels ever; or it would have scared the willies out of me if I did not already know the story in considerable details (I was a bit hazy about the last two chapters though). I should warn you that this review is full of spoilers; I wonder if there is anything left to spoil though, presumably you are well aware that the poor Count’s plan for turning all of London batty does not go according to plan. Having said that, even if you know the entire story but never read the book you ought to take the time to read it. Bram Stoker did a terrific job of creating a dark, brooding atmosphere, and writing some horrific and even erotic scenes that I imagine must have caused nineteenth century readers of delicate constitution to pass out.I am surprised that Stoker did not organize the novel into three parts, something like this: Part 1: Jonathan Harker’s visit to Dracula’s castle.Part 2: Dracula vamping it up in London.Part 3: Dracula buggers off back to Transylvania.Dracula is a very well paced novel, with several memorable characters. Starting with the Count himself of course, in the first few chapters of the book I find him quite affable and generally very polite (bad taste in music notwithstanding). I cannot help but find Jonathan Harker a bit of an idiot. Especially in the scene when he is shaving with the aid of a mirror, Drac comes barging in and he notices the old vamp’s lack of a reflection; then Drac rudely throws his mirror out the window and later Jonathan writes this in his journal:“It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.”LOL! He is annoyed that he can’t shave after seeing the Count casts no reflection? He really needs to sort out his priorities. Even before the shaving incident he notices the Count has gross hairy hands with horrible long fingers and Wolverine fingernails, and he still sticks around to discuss the sights and sounds of London with the old dude! Miss Lucy Westenra’s fiancé Arthur Holmwood is equally slow on the uptake, he notices that Lucy’s teeth have been growing longer and sharper since she became ill, especially her canines which are particularly long and pointy. He passes this off as a symptom of her illness, presumably an unexpected dental side effect from whatever virus is causing her mysterious blood loss. Only Prof Van Helsing—the man with the plan from the Netherlands—seems to know his rear end from his elbow, but even he does a very poor job of protecting Lucy. He knows there is a vampire about and he still leaves the girl alone with her mom and goes off to get a good night sleep at his hotel or something. Van Helsing reminds me of Agatha Christie’s Poirot or TV’s detective Columbo, an eccentric genius who likes to pass himself off as an amiable fool. His idiosyncratic uses of English grammar is probably more Poirot than Columbo though, with a touch of Yoda. Then we have Renfield with his intellectual conversations and fondness for insectile cuisine with extra toppings of rats. The ladies are equally memorable, with Lucy being entirely helpless to begin with until she becomes Lucy 2.0 the scary, sexy, badass vampire, better known to kids in London as “The Bloofer Lady”, Mrs. Mina Harker has much more self-reliance and fortitude, even after the ghastly “baptism of blood”; silly Drac messes with the wrong girl there. Stoker does tend to be somewhat misogynic with his assumption of what women are generally capable of, but on the other hand Mina is portrayed as strong and quite ingenious, an intellectual equal of Prof VH I would say.As far as I know Stoker was a one-hit wonder, but if you are only going to have one hit, may as well make it an all-time great. While Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein is a beautiful, poignant, and lyrical novel, it is less concerned with scaring the bejesus out of the readers, whereas Dracula is really quite horrific (in spite of my effort at lampooning it). If you enjoy horror fiction Dracula is a must-read.__________________________Notes• “Read” in audiobook format, the audiobook is read by Rob Goll .

Thank you, Mr. Goll!• Contrary to what Francis Ford Coppola and other filmmakers would have you believe, Dracula never had any romantic feelings for Mina Harker, she is just another Happy Meal to him.• Shame about Renfield, I think he would have liked an albatross on a stick. • Dracula is sometimes called “Prince of Darkness” (in Hammer films) but did you know that he is also “Prince of Logistics”, he really organizes his traveling arrangements like a pro, and he booked a hotel for Jonathan Harker!• The epistolary narrative format works quite well, but how can a bunch of people write diaries in practically the same style?• My favourite film adaptation of Dracula is the 1977 one by the BBC, about 90% faithful to Stoker's book, and gave me the willies. Somebody uploaded the whole thing to Youtube, but these unauthorized uploads are often removed so I won't link to it.
3500519168	This is just a good ole' fashioned, fun, vintage horror story. As you read it, you see how so many books, movies, and other iterations of vampires all took notes from this story. The dialogue, namely Van Helsing tends to drag on at times, but as a high level intellect, may have been Stoker's ambition, and the depiction of women is also a bit dated. However, as a whole, it is a well crafted and executed classic.
2446170249	Este libro ha sido increíble. Me arrepiento muchísimo de no haberlo leído antes. Esta es la historia de vampiros más famosa de la historia, un libro clásico del género de terror. Y sí, da auténtico miedo en muchos momentos. A pesar de ser un clásico, tiene un vocabulario bastante actual, así que no tenéis excusa, porque os prometo que no se os hará pesado. Es que tiene poco más de 100 años, no ha pasado tanto tiempo desde que fuera escrita. La historia está narrada de manera epistolar. Casi todo son cartas, partes de diarios personales y artículos, por lo que los diálogos suelen escasear. A mí personalmente no me ha molestado, es más, me parece que le da un toque muy interesante leer todo desde los pensamientos de los personajes de esta manera, me hace sentirme bastante cercana a ellos. Toca temas muy interesantes como el miedo a la muerte y a los muertos,hay toques eróticos bastante llamativos, y bueno, no es una historia de amor aunque tenga un poquito de este tema. Los personajes me han parecido muy adelantados a su época, sobretodo Lucy. Y os aseguro que os encantará meteros en la mente de estos peculiares personajes. Como curiosidad, decir que esperaba más protagonismo de Drácula, porque oye, la novela se llama así. Y aunque todo gire alrededor de él, no es para nada el protagonista de la historia, sino que son Jonathan y Mina.
5847543851	در جایی خواندم برام استوکر اولین نویسنده ای نبود که از ایده ی خون آشامها بهره گرفت.بلکه پیش از او هم نویسندگانی چون "گوته" و "جوزف لفانو" نیز به سراغ این موجودات تخیلی رفته بودند.خود شخصیت دراکولا الهام گرفته از یک اشراف زاده ی رومانیایی به نام ولادیمر تِپِش(ولاد سوم،ولاد دراکولا)بوده است. تفاوتی که دراکولای استوکر با سایر خون آشامها دارد در نوع ارائه ی او و به کارگیری دقیقِ عنصر وحشت است. "دراکولا"؛خون آشامی است که طمع حکمرانی بر کل جهان را در سر دارد.مردی بلندبالا،با صورتی کشیده،بینی عقابی،ابروان پرپشت،پوستی به شدت رنگ پریده،دندانهایی سفید و تیز،با چشمانی سرخ و نگاهی نافذ است.مردی است زیرک که قرنها زندگی کرده است و دانش و نبوغِ فوق العاده اش نیز حاصل همین سالهای طولانی زندگی و تجارب بسیار اوست. شاید یکی دیگر از دلایل تفاوت "دراکولا" با دیگر آثار گوتیک این باشد که هیچکدام از مخلوقات اهریمنی داستانهای گوتیک چنین نیتی(حکمرانی بر جهان)،در پس اعمالشان نداشتند. در این کتاب ما داستان را از طریق خواندن نامه ها،تلگرافها و مدارک شخصیتهای کتاب دنبال میکنیم.شخصیت "کنت دراکولا" به طور مستقیم در تمام بخشهای کتاب حضور ندارد اما سایه ی شوم و تاریکش در خط به خطِ صفحات کتاب،احساس میشود.تعلیق داستان در چند فصل آخر،چنان قوی است که من با نفس حبس شده و اضطراب بسیار زیادی آن را میخواندم. بار روانشناسی داستان (روانشناسی ترس)و اشارات متعددی که به کتب مقدس گردیده نیز بسیار درخور توجه است.
145680645	If you're looking for a novel which contains weird mist, some nosy ass bats, a "bloofer" lady, a mental guy who eats flies, a mysterious ship with only the captain left on board, blatant racism against Slovak people, a Transylvanian Spider-Man, that woman from "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", Hugh Jackman, a guy named Quincey, and lots of messing around in graveyards then you'll LOVE this.
4141348316	Perdí la cuenta de si esta fue la tercera o cuarta vez que leo este libro y me sigue encantando. Por primera vez en la vida lo leí con límite de tiempo para mis clubes de lectura y sufrí un poco los monólogos acerca de lo virtuosa y bondadosa que es Mina, porque iba súper atrasada y ya me urgía avanzar. Dicho eso, admito que estoy de acuerdo: Mina es la MVP. La atmósfera de esta historia es inigualable y la manera en que Stoker incorporó todo el folklore vampírico existente en la tradición oral, hacen de esta novela un clásico del horror que ha inspirado miles de otras historias y adaptaciones. Maravilloso. Mis top de momentos: la masacre del Démeter, Lucy como "the bloofer lady" y por supuesto todo lo que le ocurre a Jonathan mientras está en el castillo del conde.
4469220809	Great classic but too much repetition, not a lot of Dracula parts, lots of povs and the narrator (I listened to some on audiobook) lost me with some of the accents of the Romanian characters. Overall a beautiful read and great introduction to Dracula now I can go on with reading a dowry of blood 😬
4761610944	No era yo, era la edición. Excelente novela. Un clásico muy disfrutable. ¡Bienvenido a mi casa! ¡Entre libremente y por su propia voluntad! La primera vez que intenté leer este libro no me gustó para nada, no lo pude terminar, me pareció demasiado pesado. Sin embargo, no podía darme por vencido, conseguí una nueva edición y lo leí, y me ha encantado.Obviamente no me quedé con las ganas de hacer comparaciones entre las ediciones que tengo, debo decir que la traducción de la primera edición que leí se nota la poca interpretación en las palabras, parece que la hubiera copiado al traductor de Google, y hubieran impreso lo que se transcribió. Muy lamentable. Ahora bien, nos encontramos antes una novela epistolar contada desde diferentes personajes, la mayoría de veces por medio de los diarios personales de nuestros protagonistas. Esto, es un punto a favor para la novela, ya que nos va dando puntos de vista variados de lo que va pasando en la historia, la convierte en una novela muy entretenida y disfrutable.Lo más genial es como yo como lector iba hilando lo que pasaba en la historia y la relación que tenían los personajes entre sí, pero lo más espectacular es ver como a pesar de que Drácula físicamente no se encuentre en todas las páginas de este libro, uno pueda percibir su presencia simbólica en cada escena. "[...]Yo sentí que mi cuerpo quedaba paralizado por el pánico. Un hombre debe encontrarse con horrores así, para llegar a comprender la importancia que tiene realmente.[...]" La ambientación de la novela es excelente, paisajes hermosos y momentos de tensión, donde yo no tenía muy claro qué iba a pasar en la historia. Es algo que Bram Stoker manejó muy bien, no especificando ciertas cosas de la historia para que solo nos concentráramos en lo que iba sucediendo.Los personajes me gustaron mucho, si bien el único ser malvado es Drácula, los personajes "buenos" tienes sus defectos, algunos tienen un carácter muy débil en ciertas situaciones donde deberían ser más valerosos, otros demasiado románticos, pero, el que me sacaba de quicio era Van Helsing. Cada situación él le tenía que agregar misterio. Su frase favorita es "usted no lo sabe porque es muy pronto para que lo sepa" y eso sí que me pareció exasperante. Drácula es un gran personaje, su elegancia al hablar lo hace un ser que puede generar confianza, pero dentro de toda esa amabilidad esconde una maldad pura. Me gustó mucho su caracterización y lo bien fundamentados que son sus poderes.El desenlace lo sentí muy apresurado, todo lo que se venía construyendo parecía que iba a darnos un final ostentoso por la omnipresencia de Drácula, pero fue muy calmado, y dejando algunas cositas en el aire. Sentí que iba a ser más espectacular. Sin embargo, es un final correcto. Definitivamente una novela que vale la pena ser leída, un clásico obligatorio para todas las personas amantes de la lectura. Eso sí, no se olviden de obtener una edición bien traducida.
2284746401	“Listen to them – the children of the night. What music they make.”The granddaddy of all vampires. Thankfully, none of the vampires in this book sparkled, fawned over high school students, or got messed up in love triangles with werewolves. What Stoker gave us was a grim, gothic tale of a centuries old creature that stalked the London nights with an insatiable thirst for blood. Unlike his portrayal in movies and TV, Stoker’s Dracula was not a romantic figure that seduced women with a supernatural allure; he was the incarnation of evil, and mercilessly fixated on his victims.It’s not a scary book for a modern reader; but what it is, is haunting. It’s rich in its gothic imagery, prose, and religious symbolism, and explores the concept of infinite evil – an evil that will harm the innocent for no reason other than it chooses to do so. The story unfolds through journal and diary entries written by its characters, and this works to effectively introduce multiple perspectives and storylines, while maintaining a first person perspective. “Carmilla” is still my favorite of the classic vampire stories for its lyrical prose and melancholy tone, but “Dracula” is still an amazing read.
6775216485	A classic.. that had to be read
3777345656	2.5 stars**This is a spoiler-filled review**This gif sums up my thoughts about this book. Dracula is a classic that I have been meaning to read in a long time. It turns out that I feel so-so about it. I honestly didn't know exactly what to rate this: at moments I was feeling a strong 4, at times a 3, in the second half usually a 2, and there were moments that were so dry, I wanted to rate it a 1 (or just DNF). Fortunately I pushed through because some moments are honestly very good; unfortunately they don't make up for the overly stale parts. We all know this story: dude goes to Castle Dracula, and vampires try to take over the world. The first hundred pages were really good. I loved the journey of Jonathan Harker to Castle Dracula and him slowly realising that something is off about the Count. Everything from the very beginning where the people of the town beg him not to go and ward him agains the evil eye was wonderful at setting the tone. The long ride up to the castle was also very atmospheric, though the descriptions were a tad overbearing. The moments in the Castle itself were where the book shone. Subtle things like the Count never eating, disappearing for days, etc were fantastic foreshadowing (though of course I knew the story because it is so common in pop-culture). Unfortunately, after Harker escapes, things went down hill. By the way, at this point I was feeling a 4.25 star rating for this book. Next we had the Lucy segment, which a lot of people seem to love. Personally I felt just *good* about it. I thought it was interesting enough, but I predicted everything the first time she was described as 'pale' or when the bat appeared at her window. This time, though, I wasn't as invested because I didn't feel the same atmosphere that I was so in love with for the first 100 pages. I must say, however, that the little interlude we got about the ship coming in with the vampire was really engaging as were all the segments with Renfield the madman, though they also disturbed me quite wholesomely. It was finished a bit over the halfway point and at this point I was contemplating anything between 3.25 to 3.75 in terms of star ratings.Then, it went even more downhill. I just didn't care for most of the second half of the book. There were some good moments, like when Mina begs the men to kill her if she turns into a vampire, as well as (again) all the moments with Renfield. Unfortunately the entire chase was so underwhelming and I felt like things that were foreshadowed were suddenly undermined, so I ended up confused. The scene that stands out the most to be this way is the scene where Mina gets hipnotised for the first time and she says that the Count is on a ship. My immediate thoughts went to the ghost ship that arrived earlier in the novel, a scene that I was quite enamoured with. My thoughts were that since the Count came to Whitby on the ship, he would have the last box there... nope! It turned out he was just heading on home to Transylvania... *eyeroll* I was so disappointed and immediately a lot of my thoughts soured. At this point I basically decided on my rating of 2.5 (but I was still hovering over to a 3 star rating just in case I'd enjoy the ending). The ending was not what I expected, in a bad way. We had a bunch of the team deciding how to get to the Castle in time, but I just didn't care. The writing also got very convoluted here (maybe this is just my opinion), but it made it harder for me to read. At the end, when Quincey Morris dies, I felt like it was just for shock value. He was the member of the team about whom I cared about the least (also because he had the least page time). So overall I was just disappointed.My final rating of 2.5 stars reflects that I believe this book does have various merits. I like the format of the epistolary text as well as the pop culture that came out of it. Despite this, I can't say I enjoyed it, when I only really enjoyed the first 1/5, felt simply good about 2/5, but really didn't like, and was heavily disappointed, about the last 2/5. Taking this all into account, I am still happy I read this, I just kind of wish it would have been something more...*book completed as part of the January Classics challenge
4164313168	"You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable."Did this book just change my life a little bit? Probably. I wrote down so many quotes I literally took more time to find the perfect one than to do anything else for this review.I was not expecting this.I was on the fence for the first half of the book, but then the second half came and I could not put it down. This was about so much more than a vampire. So much more than folklore and fear. So much more than a horror story. It was about imagination and how are lives become better when we open ourselves to possibilities. How to be close minded is to be no one at all. How women are smarter and men should always recognize that (I had to add it). Bram Stoker, the book community would love you. Come back as a vampire please, they're much nicer now than the ones you wrote then.I loved the concept, the world-building, the reality vs. fear mindset. I loved that we got to see all aspects of growth in each character, that there as only one true villain. I love when people work together with no ulterior motives. It does not happen enough in books. This has officially made it onto my list of classics I will happily read again. Maybe I'll turn into a classics girl after all.And most importantly, Quincey Morris. If you have a thousand fans, I'll be one. If you have a hundred fans, I'll be one. If you have one fan, that fan will be me. I will love you forever. To get a group of men to believe in the unimaginable. To make speeches of acceptance and willingness to listen and respect other people's opinions... you were ahead of your time. You were appreciated so much, but somehow not enough. I will love you forever. As long as vampires live. And I will always allow my imagination to see beyond what is known.If you've been thinking about reading Dracula, here's your sign that it's time.
2563618595	This right here is what vampire stories are supposed to be. Dark and sinister with the evil lurking in the night around every corner. This wasn’t bloody and gory but it was absolutely perfect how it was, it made it all that much more scary! I honestly can’t believe I haven’t read this before now and I’m kind of kicking myself because it’s bloody brilliant and I couldn’t have possibly loved it more!
4154318797	Drácula, el vampiro por excelencia y uno de los más fascinantes y atemporales exponentes de la literatura gótica. Su creación, resultado de la integración del folclore del este europeo con la macabra figura histórica de Vlad el empalador, constituyó un antes y después no sólo para su autor o para la ficción de horror sino también para la cultura en sí misma porque Stoker sembró la bases de lo todo lo que hoy consideramos innegablemente vampírico, una suerte de figuras que no se reflejan en los espejos, duermen en ataúdes y temen a los crucifijos, la luz del sol y las estacas. Todo se reduce, a final de cuentas, a Drácula y a Bram Stoker.Estamos ante una novela epistolar cuya estructura consiste en la reunión de cartas, fragmentos de diarios y de notas de estudio que funcionan para dar lugar a puntos de vista diversos y multiplicidad de voces que van acentuando el misticismo y perversa fascinación que infunde una criatura incomprensible, poderosa e inherentemente maligna como lo es Drácula. Desde un joven abogado que pudo haber perecido a su merced, pasando por muchachas inocentes y médicos entregados a comprender y vencer ese dañino mal de apariencia incontenible e invencible. Bran Stoker nos dió la figura del vampiro que quedará marcada a fuego en la memoria colectiva de incluso aquellos que no han leído la novela, sí, pero la historia en sí misma no se limita a la creación de un mito. Drácula, como novela, es un estudio de las pasiones humanas en todas sus dimensiones, desde el amor romántico hasta la inquebrantable pasión carnal sin dejar fuera lo platónico pero leal de las amistades o la pasión por el entendimiento de un mundo inteligible. Una historia sobre el terror no sólo a que nos succionen la sangre de nuestros cuellos sino a lo desconocido como fuerza en sí misma. Terror a la perdida. A la muerte. A lo que pueda existir tras ella. Una novela que somete a su lector de forma implacable y exquisita, que irgue un universo terrorífico mientras desnuda inquietudes del hombre que no se deshacen sino que se perpetúan a través del tiempo y las tierras extrañas. Un texto genuinamente imprescindible, trascendental y por siempre relevante.
4049422153	“I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.”In order to push through a sale of an English home, Jonathan Harker travels to Romania. He arrives at a ruined castle and is introduced to Count Dracula. What Jonathan discovers at the castle horrifies him and makes him question all he knows. Dracula is the quintessential gothic horror novel and the blueprint of every vampire tale. This is my 3rd time reading the book and with every new read, I pick up something new that I never thought of before. At times the story gets a bit repetitious but it's such an amazing story that I quickly dismiss this minor flaw. This ethereal atmospheric read with it's creeping sense of foreboding, is one of the classics that I believe everyone should read at least once in their lives. Even if your are not a horror fan, the underlying themes of good vs. evil, as well as modern vs. traditional knowledge make Dracula worry reading. I alternated between reading the book myself and listening to the audiobook from Penguin Random House Audio, which is narrated by Richard E. Grant. If you plan on listening to the audiobook, I highly recommend this version! Many thanks to Penguin Random House Audio for the gifted copy!
3598857526	Una obra maestra, sin duda alguna. Feliz de haberle dado una relectura. Habían pasado más de diez años desde la primera vez que leí esta fascinante novela, y realmente no la recordaba mucho. La disfruté demasiado.
