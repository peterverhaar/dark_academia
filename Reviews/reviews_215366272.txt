7008328031	"Unhallowed Halls" offers an enticing premise, plunging readers into the shadowy corridors of Agathion, a secluded boarding school steeped in mystery. The story follows Page Whittaker, a scholarship student with a troubled past, as she navigates the school's archaic traditions and befriends a group of enigmatic students. The atmospheric setting is richly drawn, creating a sense of foreboding that draws readers in.The book's first half is its strongest, balancing an intriguing mystery with dark academia elements. Page's attempts to adapt to the rigid environment and her growing friendships with Cyrus, Lacey, and others are well-paced and engaging. The classical literature references add an intellectual layer, though they remain largely surface-level, missing opportunities to enhance the narrative's depth.However, as the plot shifts towards the fantastical, the story begins to lose its footing. The introduction of supernatural elements, while intriguing, feels abrupt and poorly integrated. The pacing becomes uneven, with some plot points rushed and others dragging. Several characters, particularly Lacey and Cyrus, lack the development needed to make their arcs impactful.The resolution ties up the main storyline but leaves a host of unanswered questions, such as the fate of certain characters and the implications of the school's darker secrets. While the book starts with promise, its second half struggles to maintain the tension and polish that made the beginning so compelling.Overall, Unhallowed Halls is a mixed bag. It excels in atmosphere and setup, making it a potential favorite for fans of dark academia and younger readers new to the genre. However, its uneven execution and missed opportunities may leave seasoned readers wanting more.medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter
7201357351	Dark academia gothic with demons! I found this a lot creeper than I anticipated and have discovered a new favourite read. Unhallowed Halls is the perfect combination of gothic and dark academia literary bliss. Agathion College is set on a wild and remote Scottish moor! Yes you read that correctly. This lent to the most beautiful scenery and atmosphere. Page finds herself at the prestigious college after a strange accident. Initially she feels like she has found the perfect place for herself until she discovers the college is home to a secret society based around old demonic magic that refuses to die. I devoured this. It would be incredible to read on a cold, dreary day. It’s the sort of book you want to cosy up with and forget about the real world for a while. A huge thank you to Allen & Unwin for my proof review copy and fantastic PR box. It was so much fun to open!
6809972304	3 StarsI was so disappointed, because this book should have been so good. In fact, the opening chapters were so good. But then it lost a bit of steam. It dragged for a bit. And then everything was happening too quickly. The mystery, the intrigue, the foggy setting all got set aside for plot resolution, and I just stopped caring. Because everything that made it so good to begin with was lost. And that's a real shame, because I really did want to get immersed in this magic school nestled in the Scottish highlands. And, well, I didn't get that.That's not to say it's all wrong. In fact, this book got off to such a great start that others might have no problem carrying through to the end on that momentum. I just lost my enthusiasm partway through and had to force myself to that finish line. I'll dig more into why this one didn't work for me in my full review, which will be available at Gateway Reviews on February 7, 2025.Note: I was provided with an ARC by the publisher through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. All opinions here are my own.
6838930217	This one was...okay. It was trying too hard from the outset, but I was willing to roll with it nevertheless. But once it had to start wrapping up plot, it went off the rails - and lost the gothic atmosphere that was most of what it had going for it to begin with. I'm not one to search for plot holes and pick them apart, but I had to work really, really hard not to highlight the whole book in frustrated annotations. And it suffers from what a lot of so-called dark academia suffers from these days - riding on the "these are my best friends, this place feels like home, this all matters so much" vibes without having sufficiently built them. (Not unique to dark academia, but I've definitely been noticing it a lot in this subgenre as it's trendy right now.) In short, it failed to develop enough of a foundation early on to support the plot that ends up crashing down on the reader. Thank you to the publisher for the advance copy in exchange for an honest review.
7322145713	a dark academia, boarding school in scotland, and a magical mystery??? yeah.. this book ATE!page, our main character, is the new girl at a boarding school in scotland. she’s never really had many friends until she meets a group of friends here. page though, is running from something in her past, and present. this book was amazing. 10/10! chefs kiss, would actually read again! i am amazed! this book truly was everything you want in a ya fantasy and i love it so so much.thank you so much Delacorte Press for the ARC!
7074681386	This dark academic was an easy read. A book you can devour in one sitting. I think young adults would eat this up and I would also read from this author again
6361997941	This was one of my most anticipated reads for this month. Everything about this book breathed my name. The setting, the plot, the cover, the characters. I had my copy pre-ordered for a long time already and then I saw that the book was also available through Netgalley. I didn't hesitate to request my copy and I was insanely thankful that Titan Books granted me a digital review copy. Since I prefer to release reviews shortly before the release date I could finally dive in last week.There were a lot of things in this book I ended up loving. I was insanely glad that this book didn't just call its students highly intelligent, but allowed them to prove it too. The book was infused with nods towards classic Greek culture. Myths and Legends were mentioned and used as inspiration, philosophers and scientists were quoted and used to figure things out and the author never tries to explain every little detail. You get it or you don't.I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the atmosphere of the story. I can't exactly pinpoint why, but it never really felt like I was there. I never really felt the tension and fear. I never really moved to the edge of my seat. Maybe the beginning was a little too slow, with our heroine not really involved in everything, but not really bothered by it either. Maybe the ending was too weird. Maybe the writing just didn't work for me. I just had a hard time feeling much when reading.Just like I'm not entirely convinced by the plot. There is a lot going on. It's quite bizarre and the more you think about it, it's also quite horrific and gruesome. However, in a way I missed the emotional impact of everything. I guess the writing style of the author simply doesn't fit my reading style. The finale is quite spectacular and action-packed. I'm sure a lot of people are gonna love it. Especially because the characters all get their moment to shine. I felt a little dissatisfied. I had simply wanted this book to be something it turns out it was not.
8011030117	4 ⭐️sSpookTober read 2025 A fantasy world with a dark academia vibe. It blends Greek mythology with monster encounters, a body-switching plot and sacrificing students.

7210364163	4.5 StarsDecadently vivid and deliciously atmospheric—I couldn’t put down! Unhallowed Halls by Lili Wilkinson read like the Dark Academia, YA fantasy love child of The Secret History and Ninth House, which I absolutely loved! It genuinely kept me on my toes (and glued to my seat) until the very last page. I was in awe at just how suspenseful (and brimming with the supernatural) this was! Drawing on Gaelic myth, and blending themes of friendship, identity and belonging into the intense, academic setting (complete with a crumbling gothic castle for a school, and misty Scottish moors to brood on); Wilkinson has crafted a gorgeously immersive and haunting novel (with prose to die for) that fans of gothic, dark academia are gonna enjoy. I loved the found family-esque cast of characters (Cyrus, Oak, Gideon and Ren especially, but I did warm up to Lacey by the end) who were all as emotionally in-depth and intriguing as they were inclusive. Their banter was also top notch and the nuggets of kindness and connection they bestow Page, did help endear them to me. Of all the characters though, it was Page I liked the most. As someone who grew up suffering from fairly painful menstrual cramps, I loved that endometriosis (which Page has) is not only highlighted but realistically portrayed too. Plus seeing her explain her symptoms and then experience them, will go a long way in helping to normalise how vey not normal severely painful periods actually are. I also loved that she was a complex and endearing character, whose longing to belong (and finally find acceptance in a friend group) had me eager to see her succeed. Though, with the mystery surrounding her past, there was an edge of unreliability to her that did keep me guessing for a while.And once that mystery begins to unravel, everything really starts to click into place. However, it was her resilience and self acceptance (in the face of such jaw dropping revelations) that really helped to cement her as my fave. I’m still impressed with how well she keeps her composure, as I would’ve been a complete mess in her shoes! There’s soo much I want to say, but it’s wrapped up in the plot twists (which I don’t want to spoil.) So all I’ll say is, if you’re looking for an LGBTQIA inclusive novel: full of secrets, betrayals, friendship, a hint of romance and tons of magic (both plant based and dark) —then this is definitely the book for you. Though, I do suggest checking the TWs beforehand. Also, a huge thank you to Titan Books UK for the stunning proof (and my spot on the tour.)
7245268304	Thanks to NetGalley and HarperCollins for an advanced reader copy in exchange for my honest review.Pain and Suffering. No words can describe how difficult it was to finish this book.I truly wish I had something positive to say about this book, but it was just a lot of pain and suffering. I'm seeing a lot of comparisons to Curious Tides which is honestly kind of annoying. Both books have a "Dark Academia" kind of setting but there were staggering differences that the comparison feels like the stretch of the century. The plot of Unhallowed Halls was all over the place and while some of the characters had their moments I found all of them pretty unlikable. I think I will recommend passing on this one folks.
6800317772	E-arc provided to me by Edelweiss!I was so excited to discover that Lili Wilkinson was releasing another book, ‘Unhallowed Halls.’ Wilkinson’s other fantasy books are both impressive feats of YA writing that I delight in recommending to young folks hunting for a quality read. Her characters are fantastically messy, her worlds lived-in and atmospheric, all darkness and whimsy mashed up together in a way that absolutely captivates my inner goblin.‘Unhallowed Halls’ is the dark academia treat fantasy readers have been craving since the resolution of Naomi Novik’s ‘Scholomance’ series. Genre tropes are handled (and dissected) with love. We have our academy for troubled youth, an eerie castle on a lonely Scottish moor led by a staff of aptly-named “magisters” obsessed with ancient greek philosophy. Our supporting cast of endearingly pretentious, very special teenagers with names like “Oak” and “Gideon.” Our American transplant of a protagonist, aching to belong, who wrestles with self doubt… oh, and demons.I loved every sinister twist and turn. (Cosmic horror, anyone?) I also must note the love with which Wilkinson writes authentic queer and trans characters. I can’t wait to recommend this book.
7301172582	I read this book as part of the blog tour hosted by TBR & Beyond Tours. Special thanks to Delacorte Press for providing a digital ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. 4 starsTL;DR: Unhallowed Halls is a book that I had a very fun time reading! I came for the dark academia and mild supernatural horror vibes and Wilkinson delivered on both. The intimidating structure and cold halls of Agathion combined with the fog-enshrouded moor surrounding the campus created a wonderfully gothic and eerie atmosphere that set the tone well for the story. Our MC was so easy to root for and I enjoyed the found family vibes with the "elite clique" that she finds herself taken into. While the second half of the story was a large departure from the first half, I went with the vibes and found myself enjoying the tonally different and slightly ludicrous unfolding of events. It's batty but if you can just roll with it and suspend your disbelief, it's a fun time (at least, it was for me)! 😂From the beginning, Wilkinson does a great job of setting the tone that "something just isn't quite right here" without readers being able to pinpoint what exactly that is. From the foggy moors to the austere halls of Agathion to the isolating school rules and strict Magisters to the demonic pig that almost kills our MC in one of the early scenes… There's a profound sense of wrongness that lingers around this boarding school castle set in the Scottish moors. This book was very much outside of my comfort zone although I'm glad that it was still at the level of supernatural horror/creepy that I could handle. The author does a great job in not only maintaining that bone-deep feeling of wrongness but also creating grotesque and horrifying scenes through imagery that sticks with you long after you turn the final page—at least, that's how it worked for me.Our MC, Page, was an interesting character who I found easy to empathise with. There's a sense of mystery that surrounds her character as we begin to get glimpses of things that happened in her previous schools that seem like inexplicable supernatural events, and we learn that her parents kind of see her as this ticking time bomb that could go off at any minute. She has spent her life feeling out of place for being too smart and feeling like there was something profoundly wrong deep inside of her which she hopes Agathion can fix, only to realise she's a different kind of oddity in this school of poor little rich kids. Despite experiencing quite an awkward start with the friend group she eventually became a part of, and who came to play a significant role in this/her story, she slowly finds her place with them. I appreciated the growth that Page experiences and how she comes to embrace what makes her different and most importantly, learns to forgive herself for her past. She got the healing she deserved and I was happy for her!I have to admit that the academic aspect of this story was slightly overwhelming with its philosophical discussions about the great dead Greeks—it straight up just made me feel dumb AF, haha. 🤣 If you love the "studying" aspect of dark academia, I think you'll enjoy how it's done here! I did love the Celtic mythology that's woven in as these are stories that I've not heard of before but looking it up led me down a mini-rabbit hole of internet searching to learn more. There were some great plot twists, some I (proudly) saw coming and a few others that took me by surprise! The unfolding of events picks up in pace as Page uncovers sinister secrets the more she hangs out with the clique.Now, while the first half of the story is perfectly mood-appropriate dark academia, the second half is where you'll really have to suspend your disbelief. If the first half is a slow and steady build, the second half is an unexpected explosion and while such a big tonal shift would normally irritate me, going with the flow ended up making this an intense yet oddly fun (and funny) supernatural romp! Let's just say that as the supernatural and mythological aspects get more intense, the wilder the events that happen in quick succession. There was also an added humorous aspect to one of the characters introduced later on that... I was not expecting in the least but the humour ended up growing on me although I can say it was very weird! 🤭I can fully understand why some readers might not like the second half and how it may not work for many. There were also certain elements that I wish had been better explored. The 'found family' vibes from the friendship group were great but I wanted to learn so much more about them individually and to have seen more growth in their interactions and relationships with Page firsthand. They felt too much like simple plot devices for how central they are to this story! There is also a romance which, I didn't mind all too much but I would've liked to see more of that progress organically. I wouldn't necessarily say it's instalove but there were interactions between them that I think needed proper unpacking before they got to where they were emotionally in the end.Overall though, I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did because it's so far outside of my comfort zone. Wilkinson does a fantastic job with setting the scene and creating an immersive atmosphere and while I don't know what her intention was with making the second half so drastically different, I'm glad that I found myself not minding it too much. 😂 I would say that if you like gothic dark academia vibes + mythology + demonology, I think you could enjoy this too!
7327302404	"Because ALMOST belonging is better than being alone."✨Found Family✨Secret Society✨Demons and Cults✨Dark Academia✨Numerous Queer Characters✨Gothic Vibes✨Secluded Boarding School for 'Posh F#ckups'✨Lovecraftian Elements✨Lit Nerds in LoveThis is a queer gothic dark academia dream come true—a story that ticks all the boxes for anyone who loves demons, cosmic horror, and a richly layered mystery. This novel follows Page, an intellectual outcast forced to leave her troubled past behind after a deadly incident, as she starts anew at Agathion College, an elite boarding school nestled deep within the Scottish moorlands. A boarding school that typically only allows rich troubled teens but offers her a full scholarship. From the moment Page steps into the wood-paneled halls of Agathion, she’s drawn into an environment that feels both comfortably familiar and ominously mysterious. And it certainly sets the tone with her being attacked the the school's pig mascot. Eventually, she falls into a close-knit group of friends—Cyrus, Ren, Gideon, Lacey, and Oak—who do not seem certain that she can be trusted entirely. Despite that, she finally begins to feel at home. However, as the dark secrets of the school slowly unravel, including ties to an ancient clandestine society with rumored demonic magic, nothing is as it seems.Wilkinson’s world-building is breathtaking, drawing from Greek philosophy, Scottish lore, and Celtic mythology to create a setting that’s as intellectually stimulating as it is eerie. The gradually escalating tension and the deeply intriguing magical elements kept me completely absorbed, resonating with my own experiences of isolation and the longing for acceptance during my younger school years. I suspect that it will resonate a great many readers. Especially those who adore dark academia.This book isn’t just a mystery—it’s a journey of healing and acceptance, a bittersweet exploration of identity, and a reminder that even in the darkest halls, hope and love can be found. I cried, I gasped, and I cheered for Page and her friends every step of the way. If you’re looking for a deeply emotional, intellectually rich, and utterly captivating read, Unhallowed Halls is a must-read. Pick it up as soon as you can—this is pure perfection. This is for anyone who needs to heal their inner child just a little bit.Thanks so much to TBR and Beyond Tours and the author for the complimentary copy. This review is voluntary and all opinions are my own.
7331715875	Gifted by Allen & UnwinThis is a YA dark academia fantasy set in an exclusive boarding school nestled in the Scottish moorlands, Agathion. The general consensus is that Agathion is home to rich kids who have done something wrong and not-rich kids who have done something REALLY wrong. Page is the latter. She receives a scholarship after a deadly, inexplicable incident at her old school which is pieced together through flashbacks through the story. At first glance, Page settles in nicely and is ready to immerse herself in new academic challenges and, for the first time, a whole group of friends. She soon discovers things are not as idyllic as they seem when a secret society with questionable motives reveals itself to her. Unhallowed Halls nails the moody atmosphere and the I-don’t-know-who-to-trust flavour of suspense that I need in dark academia. The character archetypes at play and they way they’re introduced is stock standard but executed well, including the menacing professors and mysterious rich kids. I do think the book would’ve been improved a bit with 1 less prominent character (no one in particular) because the last half felt a bit crammed with trying to evenly distribute the page time, if you will, and some of the storylines suffered as a result. This book is steeped in strong queer and trans representation which is always great to see, particularly in fiction for young people. I really REALLY loved that the trans character is not just touted as ‘the trans character’, but a fully realised HUMAN with substantial value and plot influence beyond their gender.I rated Unhallowed Halls 3.25 ⭐️ because I felt like it had a brilliant ‘a-ha!’ reveal halfway through that had me locked in but for the rest of the book lost focus on the settings and characters that I was invested in and was almost too plot-heavy?? I definitely prefer adult dark academia because I’ve found this is a common issue when the genre is written for a YA audience. I still think it’s a worthy addition to the magic-school niche.
7457575871	Thank you to NetGalley for this ALC. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.I wanted to love this as it sounds like something that's right up my street, It's a magical school set in the Scottish highlands, but unfortunately it didn't hit the way I wanted it to. I'd say the strongest part of this book was the first half. The opening chapters were really good and drew me in but when you get to midway it lost steam and dragged a bit for me but then in a complete 180 everything began to happen so quickly, almost too quickly. The things that drew me into this in the beginning, the foggy setting, mystery. intrigue, all got put on the back burner for the sake of plot resoution and I just lot interest.It's such a shame because it started really well, I just got bored and lost interest.
7328950977	3/3.5 🌟 Spoilerish! This was a really interesting and at some times creepy read! I enjoyed pretty much the whole story, I don’t think I would read it again purely because it was just too long! It could’ve been a lot shorter and a lot more interesting. Agathion was just all in all a bit weird especially how none of the student questioned a lot of what went on there - I just feel like a lot of it I would’ve been asking everyone what the fuck?! 😂 I enjoyed the ending and that it sort of was a circle back to the beginning but obviously with a lot of consequences 😂 This did keep me guessing and I had no idea it would end up where it did, if you are looking for dark academia & a mystery this would be right up your street!
7382169682	Thank you @prhaudio for the audiobook!This book started out so well!! Dark academia book set in a mysterious school in the moors in Scotland. It should have been a 6 star read for me from the dark academia books I’ve read in the past. But about halfway through, it really started to lose me. I don’t know if it was the writing or just the story itself but I found myself not really caring about where the story was going. I also really liked the characters but wasn’t connecting with them as much as I wish I was. Now there is really good things about this book! We have wonderful representation in this!!Queer MCDisability rep (endometriosis)Trans characters Queer side characters Amazing setting / atmospheric Trigger warning: Misgendering does not happen on page but talked about happening. Audiobook narrator does an amazing job!!
7271035491	This is an unsettling story that is creepy, enticing and well written. The atmosphere is masterfully created and I had a hard time putting this down. If you enjoy dark academia or horror, I would recommend this! Special Thank You to Lili Wilkinson,Random House Children's and NetGalley for allowing me to read a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.
7916307537	3.75⭐️
7348638155	This is an excellent example of it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t good either. Wilkinson has written an interesting dark academia fantasy, but unfortunately, I’m just not the target audience for this book.If you’re familiar with my reading taste, you’ll know that I don’t mind a YA book, but only when it is well-written and reasonably complex. For me, this book read in a very simple way, significantly lacking nuance and falling into quite a few cliches. Younger readers would probably really enjoy this one (definitely not an issue as it is a YA book), but I think that those of us that are mostly adult readers will struggle with the lack of nuance. I did enjoy the dark academia atmosphere and the British boarding-school setting. I also think it’s great that Wilkinson included transgender, bisexual, and lesbian rep. Honestly, this book was fine and I would recommend it to young teen readers, but I don’t think it caters to a wider audience or was anything particularly special.Make sure to check TWs before reading. 2/5
7270292711	Review to come!
7371622923	3.75 STARS - ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫Dark academia, mysteries, twists, magic, souls & screaming pigs!! 🐷👀This book was a super interesting read & I loved the premise & setting from the get-go. The writing was very descriptive & the imagery was beautiful. I enjoyed trying to solve the mysteries & predict the plot twists. The story got a little clunky & heavy for me near the end but I still loved this story. The Found Family aspect was so great & I loved the diversity & characters within the group.This book is a cross between The Umbrella Academy x Harry Potter x Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Thankyou Allen & Unwin for sending me a copy!
6805746874	I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest reviewUnhallowed Halls by Lili Wilkinson is a first person-POV Queer YA dark academia. When American Page enters Agathion Academy, an isolated academy in Scotland, she’s greatly interested in the focus on classics and educational methods different from the ones back home. But Agathion Academy is hiding a lot of secrets and no one is truly safe.One of the things I really appreciated was the way Queerness is depicted and how it goes against the grain in some ways. Often, when I see Bisexual/Pansexual leads, I find that the character has previously been in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex or they have already come to the realization that they are Bi/Pan or it’s normalized in the world so it’s not given a label. Here, Page knows she’s attracted to women and has previously even had a girlfriend, but it’s her attraction to Oak, who uses he/him pronouns, that opens her up to the fact that she is also attracted to men (or maybe just the one man). It’s so important for us to have a variety of ways people realize their sexuality because it truly is a spectrum and we can learn new things about ourselves as we get older or sometimes someone just comes along that throws our labels out the window. We also get some trans rep with Gideon, who is a transman, and Oak discusses how their soul doesn’t have a gender, which I appreciated.Agathion is deeply interested in Greek teachings, specifically Ancient Greek teachings. Plato, Socrates, nothing newer than the Greeks with the Roman Empire being considered new. Given how much I remember my education focusing on the Ancient Greeks, I think a lot of readers will find familiar ideas and stories, such as the allegory of the cave and Alexander and the knot, but they might also find new things they hadn’t learned before. Reading this made me realize that there is more I could know about Ancient Greek philosophy as it is the basis of so much of American culture. The pacing is on the slower end at first and slowly builds up to a faster pace in the last third. There’s a lot of building up of atmosphere in the first couple chapters and the chapters are on the thicker side, which can make a book feel slower. If you like taking your time to get immersed in a world and learning the new rules along with the character, Unhallowed Halls will let you do just that.Content warning for mentions of transphobia and depictions of goreI would recommend this to fans of YA dark academia looking for something slower paced and readers looking for a dark academia that spends time on Ancient Greek teachings
7306552864	YA fantasy meets dark academia in this wonderful and diverse book. Page Whittaker has been accepted into an elite private boarding school in Scotland. She has no idea why the school offered her a scholarship, but she's all too happy to be leaving her small Florida town after 'the incident', so she won't say no. When Page arrives at Agatheon, she feels like she's finally found somewhere that she belongs. The school prizes discipline above all, and the students are smarter than anyone Paige has met before. She hopes they didn't make a mistake inviting her here. As if catching up on her studies wasn't hard enough, she's finding it impossible to make friends amongst the elite wealthy elite that populate the school. When she manages to work her way into a close knit group with Cyrus, Ren, Gideon, Lacey and Oak, she hopes that means she belongs. But they're keeping secrets from her, and it feels like Agatheon is too. This is a fun YA book with a slightly darker twist. Agatheon is simultaneously cosy and spooky and Wilkinson has done a wonderful job in creating a strong sense of place for the school. The cast of characters is diverse, as you would hope to see in a YA book in 2025. Page's arc over the course of the novel is very well structured and satisfying to read, however I do wish she'd been able to dismantle what she believes to be 'intelligence', as I felt she had a very narrow view of it (but you can't fit everything into one book!). The pacing is comfortable, with things ramping up pretty swiftly and the mystery of the school and its students will keep you locked in looking for answers. As is always the case with YA books, there's some suspension of disbelief required for older readers regarding the competencies of the characters, but that's par for the course. It's written for young adults, so of course they will be the heroes. Overall, this was good fun and I recommend it to anyone who loves YA fantasy. Thanks Netgally & Allen & Unwin for the arc!
7301513311	Described as a YA dark academia fantasy novel (with demons?) I was instantly hooked and read the first 100 pages in a day. The imagery of Agathion school nestled in the Scottish highlands was brooding and mysterious and I loved the atmosphere the author created in the first half of the book. We meet Page who is desperate to belong and start a new life at this school after being followed by strange events throughout all her life, she starts to find what she has been looking for when she stumbles into a group of friends, although they have secrets of their own.After reading a few other reviews, I feel similar in the way that the first half of the book really captured my interest and I had really high hopes for where the story was going. Although once the initial mystery about the school came to light, it all got a bit too chaotic and jumbled for me. However I do think a lot of readers will enjoy this one!Thank you to the publisher for providing me with an ARC.
7332334658	Okay there’s a lot to unpack here. Firstly, thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for access to this ARC. I think I’d give this one 3.75. It was a little too YA for me but it was still good. The narration was really good, other than the lady’s Australian accent in places which was a little jarring. But on the whole her performance was good. The beginning of the story had me gripped, but as we moved towards 60% onwards then my goodness it got complicated. This book gives us magic, demons, and twists and turns. There’s body possessing with souls involved which sometimes makes the characters being called ‘Oak’ and ‘Not Oak’ quite confusing sometimes. But I did like the way the FMC kept learning about herself and gaining in confidence. It was giving me ‘One Dark Window’ in places but only very briefly. This book takes you on a JOURNEY… one that is quite complex, a little strange at times, but still pretty good.
7405454100	Unhallowed Halls is a gripping blend of dark academia and gothic mystery, set against the hauntingly atmospheric moors of Scotland. Agathion, the prestigious and enigmatic boarding school, is steeped in secrets - ones that stretch across centuries and intertwine with ancient beliefs. Our protagonist, Page, a scholarship student from America with a troubled past, finds herself navigating this eerie and mystical world, unsure of where she belongs. As she unravels the mysteries of Agathion, the novel delivers a fast-paced and immersive ride - though it slows in places, lingering more than necessary at times (in my humblest of opinions). With its rich setting, compelling protagonist, and an undercurrent of darkness, Unhallowed Halls will undoubtedly captivate YA readers who love gothic thrillers, hidden histories, and academia cloaked in shadows.
7472855166	This follows an American teenager, Paige, who gets a mysterious scholarship to a prestigious boarding school in Scotland. I enjoyed the setting and the mysteries along the way, such as why Paige was given a scholarship, the teachers' true motives, and the school's history. The first half starts pretty tame, then the second half delves more into the supernatural elements. All of the different plot points became a little muddled about three-quarters through, but we did get answers by the end. I would rate this closer to 3.5 stars. I would recommend this to anyone looking for YA dark academia vibes!Thank you to Netgalley for giving me an audiobook copy in exchange for an honest review!
7514653219	Unhallowed Halls I really struggled to finish this one. Dark academia vibes, secret society, demon possession and a whole lot of strange. ‘After a deadly incident at her old school, Page enrols in Agathion College, an exclusive boarding school, only to find that it's built over centuries of secrets - including an ancient society potentially linked to demonic magic.’I’m not sure what I was expecting but it was not this… The first half of the book was intriguing, following Page along in uncovering Agathion College’s secrets but unfortunately, the second half loses its footing. I felt the introduction of the fantasy element was very rushed, not fully thought out, and a bit jarring. Overall I give this read a 3 out of 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️
7330766460	If you love a gothic fantasy, mixed with dark Academia, with a bittersweet romance and sprinkles of magic and demon possession - this one is for you! The first half I was a bit worried. It started off slow and took quite a while to build up, but when it hit the halfway mark we were off running! This was SO GOOD! I love me a dark and eerie book and this delivered for me. I listened to the audio version of this and the narrators were perfect! The characters are bang on, the intonation was great, highly recommend all of it! Thank you so much to NetGalley for helping me discover a new favourite author!!
7051246260	I’m grateful I was able to read this book early, I enjoyed reading it.This story mixes dark academia with fantasy using greek mythology, witchcraft and so much more. I thoroughly loved the queer and LGBTQIA+ representation included. This story had so many layers and I liked our FMC even if I wish she had been a little more pushy with her questions at some points. This had some twists, betrayal, romance and found family elements that really brought the story together.Happily rating 3.75 - 4.0 stars.
6998221646	A rainy gothic atmosphere steeped in magic, suspense and horror. Descriptive prose that renders the setting as decaying decadence, increasingly dramatic reveals and fantastical elements that will appeal to fans of dark academia. Moody and mostly gripping but will leave seasoned readers of the genre somewhat unsatisfied. Still an excellent read if you love constant dramatic reveals, description dripping with decadence and an intense collection of misfits.𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐭𝐨 𝐀𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧 & 𝐔𝐧𝐰𝐢𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐲 𝐯𝐢𝐚 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐆𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐔𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐝 𝐇𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐋𝐢𝐥𝐢 𝐖𝐢𝐥𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐨𝐧
7972014732	This book was so unserious but in a good way. I really had fun with this, I didn't really love the first half because there wasn't much happening but I did like this overall.The characters were all distinct and multifaceted and didn't feel like caricatures and I did like our main character (even if she was a bit whiny at times).The plot and setting were also fine and even when it got serious, it felt like this book didn't take itself too seriously? I can't really give examples because I don't wanna mention spoilers but I just liked that it made me laugh even while the scene was serious.
6872620765	well it was fun and exciting and nice writing. though the characters a bit one dimensional, and the answer mystery kind of there and forseeable and (view spoiler)[and the ending so pat and middle grade nice still the action and the book's pace worked for me and i liked it more than i got frustrated with the predictable fantasy. so if you are in the mood for a nice palate cleanser and or something easy, then read it. (hide spoiler)]
7702563460	I really liked the beginning of this book. The atmosphere was great, and the story was going well. Then it got really boring in the middle... Then the whole magical part got introduced very quickly, I wish there was more time spent on that in the middle. There was just more and more and more until it completely went off the rails, and by the end, I just didn't feel satisfied and didn't connect with the characters like I wanted to. 2/5
7187563917	OHMYGODDDDDdo you ever read a book and stumble upon representation you weren’t expecting and then devour the rest of the book? This has endometriosis rep!! I so rarely see this in YA, and I really resonated with the portrayal in this main character. There’s also lgbtq+ rep!! Prior sapphic relationship, and current trans love interest!!
7723278892	I really enjoyed the narrators of this one. I loved the dark, eerie tone the book displayed and the audio made it that much better. It did start of somewhat slow, but once it picked up it was easy enough to get into. I would recommend this to friends.
7658045080	they quoted Shakespeare to each other. it was disgusting.

7323813423	Not just another Dark Academy where one who doesn't fit among wealthy kids and ancient classic texts joins and unravels more. She is more than can handle and they want her there for a reason. A secret society, plot twists and demons are unveiled. Makes for an interesting dark academy read. I was surprised by some plot twists.
7607475264	“i’m just so ordinary! i come from a regular family and a regular home and there’s nothing special about me” yes girl i agree

7322862100	In Unhallowed Halls is a hauntingly atmospheric YA novel that perfectly blends mystery, witchy occult elements, and sapphic romance. Set in a gothic-style boarding school for troubled children, hidden deep in the mountains, the story follows our young FMC Page as she tries to unravel the mystery of her own identity. Is she truly magical, or are the eerie occurrences surrounding her just a coincidence?Taking place around Samsain—the Celtic equivalent of Halloween—the book is full of spooky vibes, with haunted halls and candlelit corridors. The tension builds beautifully as she pieces together clues about her past, all while navigating a slow-burning romance and the ominous secrets of the school itself. This was my first book by Kiki Wilkinson, and I absolutely loved the mix of dark academia, supernatural intrigue, and moody occult/cult mystery. If you like the sound of that this one is for you!
7165541123	I read an eARC of this book on NetGalley so thank you to the author and the publisher. I’ve read a lot of Dark Academia and books set in British boarding schools. It’s been a while since I found one that stood out and was memorable. Well, I found it with Unhallowed Halls. This book takes those academic and boarding school elements and then blends them with Greek philosophy and Scottish mythology so beautifully to make something that felt interesting and fun to read. This manages to be dark but not gratuitous, there is violence but not to an extreme and it was all the better for it. I started reading this and I had no idea I was going to become so totally engrossed with this school and the dark secrets it contains. I was absolutely riveted. I loved the conflict between order and logic against wildness and nature. This was so well done. We have a troubled teen sent to Scotland from Florida to attend a very specific school after an incident. There she’s told she will learn to control herself. However it’s not long before she finds herself embroiled in a mystery and acquiring a new group of friends she’s not sure she can trust. This did feel a bit YA at times but never to the book’s detriment and I genuinely enjoyed reading this so much!
7241737556	UNHALLOWED HALLS was an excellent paranormal thriller. Page Whittaker is offered a scholarship to the mystery Agathion College in Scotland. This Florida girl has been looking for a new start after a disturbing incident that has left her with burn-scarred palms. Page has always been a loner. She's smarter and stranger than average teens and finds herself an outcast at whatever school she has attended and there have been lots of them. Every "incident" has resulted in her parents moving her to another school.At first, Agathion College looks like just the place for her. She loves the atmosphere, the steaming cups of tea, and classes filled with intellectual debate. And it looks like she might finally be making friends. She finds herself in a group with Cyrus, Oak, Ren, Gideon and sometimes Lacey. But everyone has a hidden agenda and has slotted Page into place to further it. Even her friends are keeping secrets from her. And then the weirdness begins... Cyrus "graduates" early and Page sees him taking part in a strange ritual. She learns that her friends are part of a secret society who want to overthrow the school's Masters and stop the evil they have been perpetrating for centuries. But ancient evil isn't that easy to overcome, and all of the group will be tested to their limits before the thrilling finale. I loved the complex worldbuilding complete with ancient goddesses and demons, and I loved the personalities of the members of Page's group. Page grows and changes a lot through the course of the story as she battles demons and finds love and friends.
7210542422	Page leaves her home in Florida, to escape from an accident in her past. She travels to Agathion College, an exclusive boarding school deep in the Scottish moorlands. She is told to not bring any technology and baggage (figurative or literal). As these things link her to the material world, and Aagthion is a school for the mind. It’s also a rule that a student will pour you a cup of tea if you were to sit at an occupied table.It was moody (in the best way), atmospheric and had all the gothic dark academia feels. Elements of Greek mythology, Greek philosophers, Shakespeare and ancient Celtic magic were sprinkled throughout the book. I really loved the friendship, found family, queer and chronic illness representations! It also had funny and sweet moments that made me smile. Overall, a very well written YA dark academia and I would highly recommend!
7290641260	This was the best kind of dark academia. I loved the school as much as Page did and the secrets it hid were thrilling and just so dark and riveting. I sped through this and just ate up every single page.I loved how on the surface the school was all about Greek philosophy but under the surface was Scottish Mythology seemingly into the very core of the school. The ending was perfect, tying this all together.It was also really easy to read. Even though they were talking about Greek philosophers that I haven’t read much about some of the time, it didn’t get bogged down in that. There would be a be a conversation about Plato or something from Greek myth and then it would move on.Honestly I wish I could go back and read this all over again straight from the start, 10/10I was gifted this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Crossposted to thewhisperingofthepages.co.uk
7354088635	This book was such an unexpectedly brilliant read! The book started out as a super intriguing dark academia story and then developed a sci- fi element that I really enjoyed. I’ve seen some other reviews saying that this was out of pocket, but I though it made a lot of sense- the story, from the first page, was set up to follow the theme of body versus mind, of what a soul is and of what makes us us. This book was super gripping and yet, surprisingly wholesome. I started off not liking the main character- she falls into some of the Dark Academia pitfalls of being too pretentious, but as the story went on, I found myself warming to her a lot. I received the audiobook early listening copy (thanks, NetGally and the publisher!) and the narration was very good, the Australian accent was a bit painful at times but mostly, I found the narrator be very engaging. I really had a great time with this one- much recommend!!
7271072313	I actually loved Unhallowed Halls.The start of it was very different to the end, in terms of the tone, in my opinion. The first part is very much mysterious because it is essentially Page's journey to figure out what is going on. Whereas the second part, you know what is happening, and it addresses this and goes with it.I would liked to have explored more of a couple of the characters. But I would 100% read this again and read a sequel or another book in this world.
7272696873	***Thank you to Delacorte Press and Cate Turner at Nicole Banholzer PR for providing a copy of the book. My review contains my honest thoughts about my reading experience.***I'm honestly not quite sure where to start when talking about Unhallowed Halls. SO MUCH happens in this book... It started off with a slow unraveling of the mysteries of both the school and the protagonist's background. This first half of the book was full of dark academia tropes and leaned heavily into the school's obsession with Greek philosophy. It was pretentious, unnerving at times, and progressed at a pretty leisurely pace. Once the masks came off, the plot became chaotic AF with things happening at breakneck speed. The last third was a WILD RIDE, and all I could do was hold on and compulsively read through to the end.All that said, I really enjoyed both halves of the book. I'm a huge fan of dark academia. So, I ate up the mystery, Greek philosophy, and weird rituals of the first part. There were some really weird and borderline grotesque scenes, too. Here's looking at you feast scene... Alternatively, the ending had so much happening that it was hard to keep up at times. I still loved the rush of it all and thought the plot made sense. It was just a lot to take in all at once, and I did need to go back to re-read some parts to make sure I didn't miss stuff.I also wish the two halves of Unhallowed Halls had been weaved together a bit more seamlessly. The dark academia vibes largely took a backseat to the dark fantasy and horror elements in the second half. I never really understood why the magisters of the school were so obsessed with Greek philosophy in the first place considering what we learned about the source of their power in the end.The world-building in Unhallowed Halls was definitely one of the things I loved about it. The author did a great job of bringing the gothic dark academia atmosphere to life. I felt like I was exploring the castle alongside the protagonist. The descriptions just completely transported me into this world. The story also had some really cool mythology weaved into the plot. I can't say too much about it because of spoilers, but I enjoyed learning about it and seeing it brought to life. The magic felt a bit basic and hand-wavey at times, often when things would come too easily. I still enjoyed it, though, and thought it all made sense.I really related to the protagonist, Page, in Unhallowed Halls. She was an outsider who never felt like she belonged. She valued intellect and was cautiously optimistic about attending a school where her gifted nature might be nurtured for a change. Page began with the goal of learning to use logic to suppress her emotions and longings. She experienced major imposter syndrome from being around such smart people for the first time. As the story unfolded, she embraced connections with a new found family and discovered that just being herself in the moment was a powerful thing. I also appreciated the endometriosis representation, which is not something I see often, and liked how the condition actually played into the plot at times rather than just being there for the sake of it. All in all, Page was complex and grew into her own through her struggles.I adored the found family in Unhallowed Halls. It provided a great character study in group dynamics. The members had a great deal of mistrust to work through before becoming a cohesive unit. I enjoyed seeing how they navigated the stages of group formation amidst the absolute bonkers situation they found themselves in. I do wish the characters other than Page had a bit more depth, though. They were all so interesting, and I just wanted a bit more from them. They spent so long hiding themselves and their true intentions from Page, but it meant hiding themselves from the reader, too.Unhallowed Halls explored quite a few great themes. It touched on the seductive and corruptive nature of power. The imagery of the mythology also had elements that made me think of the historical role of the patriarchy, and academia, in keeping women down. The dichotomy between the soul and the body was another major theme. The story explored whether a person's humanity comes from one or the other or an interplay of both. Finally, the adventure of the characters, especially Page, illustrated how a rejection of one's emotional world in favor of pure logic is not healthy and stymies one's growth as a person.Overall, I had a great time reading Unhallowed Halls. The story provided plenty of moments that had my jaw on the floor and made me squirm in my seat. I also spent plenty of time screaming WHAT at all of the chaos. lol. The two halves of the story could've been weaved together a bit better, and the end could've used more breathing room. However, Unhallowed Halls cements Wilkinson as one of my new favorite YA fantasy authors. Therefore, I rate this book 4.25 out of 5 stars. See more of my reviews and other bookish content on my blog.
7411516353	Enjoyment rating: 2Quality rating: 3I realized about halfway through this book that this wasn’t my kind of book and I wasn’t the right audience for it, but I’ll try to be otherwise as objective as possible.In the beginning of the book, the vibes were immaculate, as the kids say. The book had a rich academic atmosphere full of mystery and intrigue. The description of the library alone had me convinced this was THE book for me. The dark academia elements were right on, and Page trying to find her way in a new school with her classmates from different worlds is well done. I loved the references to classic literature, and I enjoyed the fact that I had to pull out a dictionary and Google more than once to brush up on my vocabulary or references to Greek mythology. That doesn’t happen very often, and it’s exactly what I’d hope for in a dark academia book. I wish some of the references had more depth to the story instead of just showing how educated the characters are, but they’re fun regardless. It was perhaps trying a little too hard, but I was here for it.Things got weird when it moved from dark academia boarding school with super rich kids to the magical elements. What was working really well was lost in trying to develop and explain what was going on. There are a lot of complex explanations, fast action scenes that are hard to follow, and a lot of confusing events. To be completely fair, I’m not into demons or body swapping as concepts, but I also had a hard time following what was happening — or figuring out why I should care. There are a lot of weird things going on, and I found it more gross and disturbing than enjoyable in any way. The character development started out well, but several characters had big moments later in the book that didn’t hit for me because their development had paused. I sometimes had a hard time remembering which character was which, which got even worse when body swapping came into the picture. It seems like found family was supposed to be a key element of this, but there were characters that never seemed to have a relationship built with Page herself except for just being part of the friend group automatically. It also seemed like there wasn’t a lot of development in the overall effects of what happens in the book and how this school and the actions of it have been going for so long. What happens after the events in the book? What kind of impact did this have in the world? How closely connected is the mythology of this book to the real world? I never could figure it out. There’s a big need not to ask too many questions to get through the book, and I found myself not wanting to ask them because I didn’t really want more details about this weird world anyway. I did wonder why all of these students for generations didn’t ask those questions though. The kids that go to this school are supposed to be smart, but oh boy are they willing to be oblivious about some really weird stuff. Overall, this wasn’t a book for me. I just don’t like gruesome elements, demons, or body-swapping much. If I read something with those elements, I need the book to be well-written to convince me to stick around anyway. This book didn’t do that. However, I think dark academia fans looking for a dark magic story may enjoy this a lot.Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for the advance copy of this book for purposes of review. My opinions were not influenced by this at all.
7031375815	I've been struggling with what to rate this book as I've got a lot of mixed feelings about it. It's not a bad read, but it's not amazing. It's an average, easy read. I really like the premise, I think it's really enticing, and the atmosphere is really rich. I really liked the dark academia element, and the first night in the school was really interesting. I'm a huge Alexander the Great nerd so the "don't be like Alexander... but don't be late for breakfast" got me really excited. I genuinely would have eaten this up 10 years ago. However, I'm 24, and my degree was in History (particularly Greek/Roman history and myth) and Philosophy. And the aspects of philosophy that this book drew on just felt underdeveloped and I feel like they could have been explored a little bit more to help the reader understand what was going on. It also really irked me that near the beginning it mentions the myth of Arachne and blaming it on Hera, when Athena was the goddess involved in that particular myth. I recognise it's a really tiny thing to pick up on, but it just made the book feel like there was a lack of research behind it.I think the characters were interesting. Page really annoyed me, and she felt rather undeveloped throughout the book. She was constantly whinging about believing everyone else thought they were better than her - even when characters were being fairly nice to her all things considering - and I feel like she felt she was better than everyone. She never really gets out of this mind frame, and it becomes really irritating once we hit the 50% mark. Similarly, the character's main weakness is the desire to belong, and I understand how much rejection hurts, but the hissy fit Page threw when characters she had know for like 3 weeks ditched class without her just felt so entitled.I liked the inclusion of such a diverse range of characters, particularly making them LGBTQ+ and making it relevant to the story was so important to me. Often characters can feel forced in to say a story is inclusive, but this one didn't feel forced, it was an aspect I really liked.I also will admit I was kicking and giggling like a kid when Page and Oak had their little moments - one moment in particular but I don't want to give any spoilers. I also like they just stuck to the word "like" rather than rushing into any feelings of "love" as again, this book took place over 6 weeks and I would have been beyond mad if they had confessions of love that early. So this one is definitely a more realistic love interest rather than "insta love", which is surprising considering they're kids and people throw the word "love" around so much at that age. I think the plot sorta fell apart towards the end and I'll be honest, the only thing that kept me reading was being beyond the 75% mark and not wanting to DNF it. I would definitely recommend this to a younger reader of YA. But I'm not sure if older readers would enjoy it Thank you to Netgalley and Titan Books for an ARC copy of this book to read and review
7410843462	Rating: 3.5 StarsBesties, If you love dark academia with eerie vibes, secret societies, and a FMC who stumbles into way more than she bargained for, then get ready, because Unhallowed Halls by Lili Wilkinson is a hauntingly fun ride.Page Whittaker is a bookish loner who just needs a fresh start. After a certain incident at her old school (that may or may not have included a little death and destruction), she’s given the golden ticket to Agathion College, an elite boarding school tucked away in the moors of Scotland. Think dark wood paneling, candlelit libraries, and a student body that looks like they stepped straight out of a gothic novel.At first, Page is living for this academic dream. She finally finds a group of close friends, Cyrus, Ren, Gideon, Lacey, and Oak, all brilliant, mysterious, and just a little too perfect. But, plot twist: They’re also hiding something. And that something? Possibly linked to an ancient clandestine society with ties to demonic magic. As the term goes on, Page begins to piece together the dark history of Agathion. Some students have disappeared. Some secrets should have stayed buried. And, oh yeah…she might have accidentally signed up for more than just midterms and study groups.🖤 What I Loved: Gothic Vibes & Deadly Secrets✔️ Dark Academia Aesthetic: If you love the atmosphere of books like The Secret History, A Lesson in Vengeance, or Babel, you’ll devour this. Agathion is every moody, bookish dream come true…until it’s not.✔️ The Friend Group: Let’s be real—any time a book gives me an exclusive, too-cool-for-you academic clique with sinister secrets, I’m in. The squad here is intriguing, layered, and just the right amount of suspicious. (Also, are we even reading a dark academia book if the FMC isn’t falling in with a dangerous, intellectual crowd?)✔️ The Mystery: Why is everyone acting so shady? Who is lying? Why does Page keep getting weird visions?? The slow unraveling of Agathion’s past keeps you hooked, and while the pacing isn’t always perfect, the eerie suspense is.✔️ Supernatural Elements: Demonic magic + a boarding school with a cursed history = an automatic win in my book.What Didn’t Quite Work: Some Pacing Issues & Predictability- Slow Burn (and Not in the Swoony Way): The beginning is a bit slow, and while the gothic vibes are immaculate, I wanted more action earlier on. Some moments drag, and I kept waiting for the “big twist” that I saw coming miles away.- A Little Too Familiar? If you’ve read A Deadly Education or The Atlas Six, you might feel like you’ve seen some of these tropes before. While still enjoyable, I was hoping for a few more surprises.Is Unhallowed Halls groundbreaking? No. But is it fun, atmospheric, and full of eerie academia vibes? Absolutely. If you love the scholarly but make it spooky genre, this one will scratch that dark academia itch. Just be warned, at Agathion College, history isn’t just history, and some secrets refuse to stay buried.
7249600308	From the publisher: “An American teenager joins an exclusive boarding school hidden deep in the Scottish countryside. New friendships blossom, but not everything is as it appears...Page Whittaker has always been an outcast. And after the deadly incident that destroyed her single friendship at her old school, she needs a fresh start. When she receives a scholarship offer from Agathion College, an elite boarding school folded deep within the moors of Scotland, she doesn’t even consider turning it down.Agathion is everything Page has ever wanted: a safe haven full of dusty books, steaming cups of tea and rigorous intellectual debate. For the first time in her life, Page has almost managed to make a close group of friends. Cyrus, Ren, Gideon, Lacey and Oak help her feel at home in Agathion's halls—the only problem is, they're all keeping secrets from her.It seems Page’s perfect new school has dark roots—roots that stretch back to its crooked foundation, and an ancient clandestine society. Page quickly learns that not everyone at Agathion is who they say they are.Least of all her new friends.” For anyone liking their Dark Academia (very popular at the moment!), this is a book that should tick all the boxes. An outsider wanting to fit in, a strange isolated place of learning, odd academics, companions of different shades, sorcery, magic and ancient rituals. Not to mention stacks of revered books, mountains of food and copious cups of tea.Really, though, it’s a story that’s about belonging – or a lack of it. Page desperately wants to find stability and safety in her life, after traumatic events earlier in her life (which are described and explained as the book progresses.) She is an outsider, with no friends, separated from her family and starting a new life in Agathion College. This does all sound rather unpleasant, although Lili makes Page a likeable enough character, albeit with a dark past, for which Page feels very guilty.In terms of characterisation, generally they are what you expect – the good guys are good, the bad guys less good. It’s an enigmatic collection of misfits and reprobates, all locked away in an isolated school for students on their last chance (what could possibly go wrong?)I soon realised that this is a book that has themes and ideas similar to that very-well known series, but given a contemporary makeover. This is something that is for more modern readers, perhaps. This is being marketed as a Young Adult novel, although I found it engaging enough for older readers like myself. Keeping with the times, there is an LBGTQ character, there is a trace of sex and same-sex relationships, but nothing too graphic, there is talk of periods and the sort of confusing feelings that teenagers experience, which should make the book relatable to many readers. It’s not off-putting, but it is partly what makes the book different. I was pleased that such details were not heralded as major issues but allowed to be gently nurtured as the plot progressed – we may finally be reaching a point where such details in novels are seen as just part of the general scheme of things, rather than something odd or unusual.What surprised me most was the smatterings of Shakespeare quoted throughout and the emphasis on Ancient Roman and Greek philosophers and teachers at the beginning – Plato, Diogenes, Socrates are all mentioned. This raises the book up sharply into a novel that makes you think about wider issues - there’s a good dollop of philosophising debate which may make non-Classics readers want to know more, with lots of philosophical points to muse over there.About halfway through there’s an intriguing twist, which rather turns the plot on its head. The book moves away from being about making friends and a gentle romantasy to something else more akin to a race against time and the resolution of ancient wrongs. The ending is good, although some throwaway comments at the end about what happens next seemed naïve and took the shine off a little for me.Nevertheless, Unhallowed Halls is a good read in an increasingly crowded niche of the Fantasy genre, with lots of things regular Dark Academia readers will like (and perhaps expect!) and enough originality to make it stand out. I read it very quickly, as it quickly became an un-putdownable read.
7298727111	I have been looking forward to this book ever since I heard about it because I enjoyed the last book I read by the author. I knew this book was likely to be the perfect mix of tense and atmospheric and it definitely lived up to those expectations. The setting was fantastic a school in a secluded Scottish setting, so it’s mostly damp and cold, in an old building that happens to be built between a ring of standing stones. I could feel the chill in my bones just reading about it and of course, it added to this mysterious and elitist school, who seem to only deal with Greek scholars and doesn’t seem to have a set graduation.I won’t lie a lot of the academic references on the different philosophers went over my head but I could feel the research in the pages and it helped to give the school its exclusive feel. It also adds to the mysterious quality that you feel as soon as Page arrives there because you feel like all the students are in on a way of life that the rest of us couldn’t comprehend.That quality is what caught my attention and made me eager to devour this book, there were so many questions that I had and more unusual things kept happening which propelled me further into the story. There comes a stage, after a lot of strange occurrences, where the story adds some fantastical elements, which I enjoyed and gave me a lot more questions and a bit of a chilling feeling about where the story was headed.I would never have predicted where this story was going there are so many twists and turns it certainly keeps you on your toes once the action starts to pick up. I won’t say too much about the plot because I don’t want to spoil it but I will say that the pace ramps up and there are a few things that happen that I felt I didn’t get enough time to digest before the next thing happened. I felt like I didn’t get the chance to invest myself as fully in the characters in the second half of the story because everything was happening so quickly.The characters were all pretty intriguing, they all had a brilliance about them, I quite liked that in a school that is supposed to be an equaliser in terms of outside status and privilege, there still managed to be groups and some hierarchies. I enjoyed the relationship between Gideon, Ren, Oak, Lacey, and Cyrus, they seem at the same time tight-knit but also very separate people, which makes for some interesting dynamics. Page is quite a curious and complex character we hear things from her perspective but she is also a bit of a puzzle, which makes for an interesting protagonist. Unhallowed Halls is both a mysterious and exciting story, I almost read it in one sitting because I didn’t want to put it down. I’m looking forward to what the author comes up with next because I love the dark, chilling, and tense atmospheres that she creates.Originally posted on everywhere and nowhere
7363004024	Thank you @https://tbrandbeyondtours.com/ for this amazing book!!!After a deadly incident at her old school, Page Whittaker is desperate for a fresh start. She jumps at the opportunity when she receives an unexpected scholarship to Agathion College, an exclusive boarding school hidden deep in the Scottish moors.Agathion seems perfect —grand libraries, intense intellectual debates, and a group of friends who finally make her feel like she belongs. But as Page settles in, she realizes not everything is as it seems. Her new friends—Cyrus, Ren, Gideon, Lacey, and Oak—are all hiding secrets, and the school's history is darker than she ever imagined. Rumors whisper of an ancient clandestine society lurking within Agathion halls—one that might have ties to demonic magic. As Page uncovers buried truths, she learns that history isn't always just something to study—sometimes, it's something you should be afraid of.Tropes- Dark Academia- Elite Boarding School with a Dark Past- Found Family with Hidden Agendas- Secret Societies & Occult Magic- Gothic Mystery & Unraveling Secrets- Morally Gray Characters & Betrayals- Slow-Building Suspense & Psychological TensionUnhallowed Halls delivers on its dark academia premise, drawing readers into the haunting, mysterious world of Agathion College. The setting is richly atmospheric, with its gothic architecture, eerie moors, and hidden history, making it feel like a mix of The Secret History and Ninth House.Page is compelling, though her past remains somewhat vague at first, adding to the intrigue. The side characters are interesting but elusive, each hiding something, which creates suspense but also makes them harder to connect with emotionally. The pacing is a slow burn, with the tension gradually escalating as Page begins to piece together the truth about Agathion and its secrets. The demonic magic subplot adds a supernatural edge, though it remains **more of an undercurrent than a full-blown fantasy element.If you love dark academia or any of these books, then Unhallowed Halls should be your next read!!✨Curious Tides by Pascale Lacelle✨Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo✨The Secret History by Donna Tartt✨A Lesson in Vengeance by Victoria Lee✨How to Become the Dark Lord and Die Trying by Django WexlerUnhallowed Halls is a slow-burn, atmospheric dark academia novel with secrets, supernatural hints, and an unsettling undercurrent.

7236257268	I feel like I’ve been rather burnt out by ‘academy’ stories recently. There seems to be so many, and they all end up being sappy and romantic in a way that I’m absolutely certain life at boarding school is not.Fortunately our narrator Page is so likeable that I found myself a fair way into this book before the… let’s say Strange and Unrealistic aspects really made themselves felt.‘Unhallowed Halls’ is a clever, thoughtful and beautiful story of a ‘gifted’ girl (but not in the way you think) growing up. Yes, this is very ‘Young Adult’ - and I did get frustrated as a Mature Adult watching these youngsters make mistakes on their adventure! - but Page is someone I’d genuinely want to help, to befriend and to share her journey with. I saw my younger self in her, often the New Kid at school and being thought weird for taking time among the trees and green spaces rather than behind the bike sheds. The language here is particularly remarkable. This book has deep Pagan roots and the author has done her homework. The tactile nature of everything leaps from the pages, with the scents of heather and rosemary, the experience of tea and scones, the cold atmosphere of an ancient tower. The contrast between the wonderful wildness versus the pretentious philosophising of the faculty is appropriately frustrating and amusing. These adults seem eons away from understanding their young charges, and as the reason for this becomes apparent, I was rooting for our heroes even more. The magic that slowly reveals itself is accurate to that of modern Paganism, and I had to laugh at the jabs towards how ‘fluffy’ that can be - because this is a thoroughly 21st Century tale, as the protagonists deal with weighty issues of gender and self, found family, loss and personal truth. None of this is heavy-handed; in fact, Lili’s touch can be both gentle or furious as needed. Anger is valid but so is grief, and the concluding themes of friendship, love and hope actually made me tear up a bit. Perhaps my only nitpick is that from the halfway point or so, this becomes a rollercoaster. I didn’t realize we’d been on the slow uphill climb, but after a Big Reveal, we get so many ups and downs that it felt like the end of the ‘Lord of the Rings’ movies! Surely it should be ending now… nope, still more miracles to work and baddies to defeat! Not a huge problem, but with the villains being rather moustache-twirly Eeeeeevil, I didn’t want Page to become a ‘Mary Sue’-type heroine, nor the plot to descend into a sappy Superfriends scenario. Fortunately it does not (phew!). And the epilogue is the perfect cherry on the cake.It was an absolute pleasure to walk the Unhallowed Halls. I’m looking forward to dipping into this author’s back catalogue, as well as seeing what she does next.I was kindly sent an early copy of this book by the publisher, but the above opinions are entirely my own.
7214398485	Review of Unhallowed Halls by Lili Wilkinson Thank you to TBR & Beyond and Delacorte Press for providing me with a digital ARC. All opinions are my own. Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)I absolutely loved this book! Unhallowed Halls perfectly captures the dark academia aesthetic with its eerie boarding school setting, a deeply immersive atmosphere, and a mystery that slowly unfurls into something far more sinister.The book starts off a bit slow, but I didn’t mind because the writing was so evocative and atmospheric that I was happy to just soak it all in. As we follow Page’s arrival at Agathion, the unsettling nature of the school is evident from the start. The creeping sense of unease, the strange history of the institution, and the tightly-knit yet secretive group of friends she falls in with all build toward a deeply compelling mystery.I really enjoyed the cast of characters, though I do wish we got a little more development for Lacey and Gideon. However, Page’s perspective is engaging, and watching her try to piece together the secrets of Agathion was so satisfying. By the halfway mark, the mystery begins unraveling rapidly, and the pacing picks up significantly. The last half of the book was impossible to put down—I flew through it in one sitting!While the first half is steeped in moody, gothic atmosphere, the second half leans away from the dark academia vibes and hurtles straight into Lovecraftian horror. The sense of creeping dread turns into full-blown cosmic terror, and the transformation is absolutely gripping. The twists, the tension, and the unfolding of dark secrets kept me absolutely hooked. Final Thoughts: Unhallowed Halls is a perfect read for fans of Curious Tides and dark academia mysteries that blend atmospheric writing with sinister secrets. It delivers everything I hoped for—moody aesthetics, morally gray characters, eerie history, and a slow-burning but rewarding mystery that builds into something truly terrifying. I highly recommend this one and can’t wait to see what Lili Wilkinson writes next!Follow me on socials for more reviews:Instagram | TikTok
7380798553	I think my review will be echoing a lot of others - I loved the premise of this book but felt that the pacing and characterization left a lot to be desired, and there were too many plot holes for me to ignore. Page has always felt out of place, eager for a more intellectually stimulating environment than her hometown in Florida. When something terrible happens to her girlfriend and teacher, Page is then invited to Agathion College in Scotland, which promises to nurture the mind and teach control over the body-just what Page always dreamed of. When she gets there, she's met with the same issue she's always had: not fitting in. There are cliques of rich kids and friends she wishes she had, and just as she's about to break in to one, she finds both the students and the school hold more secrets than she could have imagined. The first part of this book was atmospheric and tense, setting up a great premise and promising an intriguing mystery. I started to get a little more confused as Page wasn't really going to classes, wasn't doing the extracurricular she was supposed to choose, and hadn't really learned much at all (at least that the reader was aware of) after a month of being at the school. Then everything just hits warp speed and the magical aspect goes off the rails. I found it interesting, but there was just so much thrown at us that we hadn't really had the setup for. There were relationships that were suddenly very deep and close, magical systems that were figured out in the span of a single page, and then more and more and more rapid-fire-style. There were also a lot of references to ancient Greek philosophy that weren't really explained, then a bunch of Celtic/Scottish mythos that also wasn't fully fleshed out, and so much telling but not showing. Page TELLS us she really admired and worshipped the magisters but that doesn't happen at all on the page. She TELLS us she loves Oak but there isn't enough to make that feel realistic (this one I can forgive, because teenagers).It had so much promise! But it just left me wanting more and somehow less at the same time?
7099200635	This YA fantasy perfectly combines dark academia with teenage identity issues and a whole lot of witchy drama. Set in an ancient Scottish castle, the school of Agathion is home to so-called “troubled teens”, sent away by their families to get an education designed to whip them into shape and be acceptable to society. But the school has a dark history, and when new student Page Whittaker arrives she sets into motion a chain of events that nobody foresaw.After her teacher’s mysterious passing at her school in Florida, in rather peculiar circumstances, Page is sent to Agathion by her parents. After receiving a scholarship allowing her to attend without paying the crazy school fees she sets off for Scotland. The strange traditions of the school, and the curriculum focusing on ancient Greek philosophers make Page feel more isolated than ever. When a group of the school's long-term residents decide to take Page under their wing she begins to feel more accepted. That is until she realises that her new friends are keeping secrets from her, and then begin to disappear. Page knows there's something about her that isn’t quite right and when more strange things begin to happen at the school she sets out to investigate before anyone else disappears.Right from the start you know that there’s something strange about the school but you’re almost led to believe that it's just a quirky boarding school with eccentric professors and a strange curriculum. But as the story progresses things get stranger and stranger, until you know there’s something supernatural at work. There were so many twists in the plot that I didn’t see coming and I flew through this book, desperate to figure out just what was going on!The representation in this book was great, with most of the main characters being from different countries or ethnic backgrounds, as well as openly discussing their sexuality and the struggles they faced to be true to themselves. It was nice to see a group of teens from all different backgrounds working together to defeat a common enemy, though of course there are still your everyday teen dilemmas present as well!

7115829985	Find this review and more on my blog at Worlds Unlike Our Own .Thank you to the publisher, Penguin Teen Canada, and NetGalley for providing me with an eARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.Page Whittaker has just received a scholarship from Agathion, an elite private boarding school in Scotland. Though she has no idea why she was chosen, she is only too happy to leave her small Florida town behind after an incident at her old school. And at first, Agathion seems perfect, a haven for intellectuals, and Page even feels like she might be making some friends, except that she’s certain they are hiding something from her – and so is Agathion itself. As Page begins to learn more about her new school, she will come face to face with the dark history behind it and unearth a conspiracy tied to a secret society that supposedly has ties to demons and magic.I’ve been trying to read different types of books within my usual genres this year, and this fit the bill perfectly. Dark academia is something I’ve tried in the past a few times, and I’ve mostly enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to returning to that genre again.I know the synopsis of this book basically said ‘dark academia with demons’ but that definitely didn’t prepare me for it. The first half of the book certainly had a lot of dark academia vibes, and this was my favourite part of the book – introducing Agathion, a school that was mysterious and somewhat creepy, but at the same time appeared to be a cosy haven of learning, tons of Greek philosophy and weird rituals. The world building was excellent, it really brought the whole feel of Agathion to life and I felt like I was exploring those halls right alongside Page.The second however, was very different, taking a sharp turn into dark fantasy and demons with a side of horror. It was an intriguing read, with some fascinating mythology to tie it all together, but I do wish the story as a whole was more cohesive. The book felt like it was in two distinct halves, which I found disappointing, as without the dark academia part, this would not have been nearly as appealing to me.Despite my little disappointment with how the plot played out, the story had me completely hooked. It did take a little while for things to get moving, but once it did, it was one crazy roller coaster all the way to the end. The pacing was steady throughout and the writing was pretty good too.Page was an interesting character with a pretty complicated past that she has never been able to explain. She was just as adrift as the reader throughout this book, so seeing things through her perspective and following along as she discovered not only Agathion’s secrets, but the truth behind the incidents she has experienced was great. However, her character arc was not the most realistic in my opinion, seeing as this entire book took place over six weeks or so.The secondary characters, while they were likeable and the whole found family dynamic they had was lovely, I didn’t really connect to them as much. I think that’s just the nature of the genre though, because the plot held my attention so firmly that even if there were more POVs or backstory for these characters, I doubt it would have had much impact.Honestly, there were at least three points in the book where I thought it was nearing the end, and then I checked the page count on my kindle and there were way too many pages to go. That said, I did enjoy the many plot twists that set the characters off on yet another tangent to handle some or the other unexpected event. It was all rather chaotic, but so much fun to read!I felt the ending was a bit much, personally, especially with Page supposedly having these abilities all her life but never knowing, and then all of a sudden, being able to basically work all kinds of miracles. It required a significant suspension of disbelief, but if you can manage that, it was quite good.Overall, I enjoyed Unhallowed Halls. It was an entertaining read, and it has also encouraged me to start reading dark academia again – I had quite forgotten how much fun it is! I would highly recommend this book for fans of the genre!
7081909409	Thank you so much to NetGalley and Lili Wilkinson for providing me with a complimentary digital ARC for Unhallowed Halls coming out February 18, 2025. The honest opinions expressed in this review are my own. Page Whittaker has always been an outcast. And after the deadly incident that destroyed her single friendship at her old school, she needs a fresh start. Which is why when she receives a scholarship offer from Agathion College, an elite boarding school folded deep within the moors of Scotland, she doesn’t even consider turning it down.Agathion is everything Page has ever wanted: a safe haven full of dusty books, steaming cups of tea and rigorous intellectual debate. And for the first time in her life, Page has even managed to become part of a close group of friends. Cyrus, Ren, Gideon, Lacey and Oak help her feel at home in Agathion's halls--the only problem is, they're all keeping secrets from her. Page doesn't know it yet, but her perfect new school has dark roots--roots that stretch back to its crooked foundation, and an ancient clandestine society with rumored ties to demonic magic. Soon, Page will be forced to learn that not everyone at Agathion is who they say they are. Least of all, her friends.Agathion claims to teach its students history…but some histories should stay buried.This is the first book I’ve read by this author. I really love dark academia and creepy boarding schools. I think there was a lot of mystery in the beginning. Page and her friends were interesting. As the story progressed, I lost some interest. There were just a lot of things going on for me. I was hoping it would stick more to one genre. I would definitely read another book by this author, but I don’t think this book was for me.
7360456104	Unhallowed Halls is truly a read/listen for lovers of dark, gothic academia and most definitely delivers demons, magic, hidden secrets, societies and more. From the introduction to Paige on her lone journey to her new school Agathion College to which she has been awarded a scholarship, through to the climactic conclusion of this standalone YA fantasy, you are plunged into a complex story filled with multiple twists and turns that will make you dizzier than multiple rides on a waltzer! In amongst this plot you have a group of characters whom you will definitely gradually w to love and grump at, especially when they make idiotic choices that are often the case at this age, and world building that pulls you into the gothic academia world of Agathion College established many years earlier for the education of troubled teens! Paige is a severely traumatised teen, carrying and driven by the huge weight of her past experiences and guilt with her. Always a loner, she finds herself at sea amongst the elite, of this new school, until she finds what she hopes to he friendship, if only she and they can get past all the hidden secrets both they and the school hold, which could have fatal consequences for them and the rest of the school! There’s a journey to be taken, the power of friendship, love and kindness to be unearthed, as well as a little body swapping and the odd mortal danger to face. Lili Wilkinson has written an immersive and fast paced dark academia fantasy that is truly brought to life by Imani Jade Powers’ narration. Thank you so much Bolinda Audio for advanced access to this audiobook. All opinions expressed here are my own.
7365106244	3.5⭐️. Page Whittaker has moved from school to school for auspicious reasons, and she has now been offered a scholarship to an exclusive boarding school in Scotland, renowned for hosting the troubled children of the elite and upper echelons of society. Having always felt isolated, she longs to fit in and soon attaches herself to a tight knit group of friends, made up of Cyrus, Ren, Gideon, Lacey and Oak. However, it soon becomes clear that they’re keeping secrets, which they’re reluctant to divulge, and Page has secrets of her own…I thought the scene setting in the first half of this book was great - quite gothic and very atmospheric. It felt a little reminiscent of books like The Invocations and Starling House. I also liked the group of friends, who were an interesting bunch of characters. So the first half really had me hooked. The second half is much more action heavy and leans more into the fantastical. In theory, I should have loved that; however, the move of focus from characters to action felt a little disjointed and made the events less impactful. An example is the romantic relationship between Page and Oak - while I really liked the potential for them as a couple, it felt like it went from a slow build up of strangers to friends, but then rushed from friends to lovers. Overall, I enjoyed listening to this audiobook, which was really well narrated, and I’d recommend giving it a go for those who enjoy dark academia, but it’s not a new favourite. Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the ALC of this book.
7310620549	I genuinely think Lili has written this book purely for me because it has almost everything I want rolled into a fun, fast paced YA novel. Page has never truly fit in so when she was offered a scholarship to an elusive Scottish boarding school after life’s latest mishap she jumps at the chance of a fresh start. What Page doesn’t expect is to be thrust into a world of where her secrets may just get someone, or everyone, killed. Page is not like other girls- she’s worse. I live for a dark academia setting- throw in some ominous warnings, secret societies, mythology and demons and you’ve made me one very happy reader. I loved that while the setting felt reminiscent of a great academia story the plot was still unique in how it dealt with the fantasy elements. Page is smart, and while she’s been knocked down every time she refuses to give in and ultimately this is what makes her a loyal, determined FMC who recognises why she hasn’t earned the trust of her peers. The way she questions herself feels realistic of a teenage girl.I loved the found family aspects. It’s my favourite trope. Oak has my entire heart, I loved his quirky vibe and the way he fiercely loves and protects his friends. The world building wasn’t overly intense but the action packed a punch. The Greek and Scottish mythology was nicely tied into the story which added depth to the supernatural elements that Page and her friends were up against. I want to say a massive thank you to Allen and Unwin for allowing me to read this pre-publication. This is my honest review.
7562413394	⭐️⭐️⭐️I’m not really sure how I feel about this??There were certain scenes with powerful imagery, really keeping me hooked, and then there were strange one liners that set the whole tone of the book off. I felt a little confused about what the texts intentions were, it didn’t really feel like it fit well in any set genre, which was a little disappointing because the premise is so interesting. I wanted to love this so much more and it was realistically only Oak that was persuading me to continue.I did really admire and enjoy that each person in the main group had their own distinct identity and motivations. Some were definitely fleshed out more than others, but when a story is centred around trust and honesty you need to actually build that trust with the reader and I feel like that, at least, was done well. Page however… erm girl. I know we were going for a complex and intellectual female lead, but (and this is where I feel like the tone of the text was not well developed) I couldn’t figure out if her character was meant to critic the romanticism of dark academia or if she was just that naive. Like the amount of times I sat there and just thought wow… she is kind of really annoying right now. (Spoiler!!) she finds out the school is corrupt and all the ideals she’s been clinging too are wrong and misguided and she still walks out of there which some attachment to that life. I feel like I understand where it was trying to go, but I don’t think it successfully got there :(
7293898423	Philosophical debates, wrapped up in mysteries with appendages of old magic and a love language of Shakespearean insults.I loved this book.From the dark academia aspect of a girl with a troubled past going to a boarding school in the middle of Scotland to the soul-catching talents which emerge within Page there is little left to ask for in this YA novel.There are definitley a few times which gave me a nostalgic yearning from my time going Philosophy in Uni, one that I welcomed like an old friend.The plot twists were somewhat predictable in the plot device way however there are some elements that leave you and the characters shocked. What I loved the most was the natural queerness that lived within Page's world and identity. It did not come as a plot device but a part that was emblazoned on her blazer.There was one thing that seemed weird though: periods. At the start I wondered if it would be the weirdest plot device and yet it still didn't gain major relevance. Though it was nice for a teenager to have a similar experience to which I experienced growing up. Especially that critique of the weird always adverts which claim that a period is only two table spoons- a thing I feel like an idiot came up with. Yet, apart from this odd detail this book was brilliant.I received a complimentary copy of this book from #netgalley , thank you. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.
7841030264	The premise of this was promising, but I think it felt too much like a debut novel or a first draft for me to fully come to its potential. I wish the academia part of this was a bit more on the fore-front, instead of it just taking place at a school (where the students don’t really study, and the teachers don’t really teach… I guess?) The philosophy aspect was nice, but underdeveloped and didn’t seem to fit too well with the rest of the story. TLDR: I feel like the author had 62938 ideas and just crammed them all into one novel, leaving it like a jumbled mess of “almost”-Animus Supra Corpus.Mind over body.-Agathion is a school for the mind.A sanctuary for those who live in the realm of the mind, who seek to see past the shadows and distractions of base feelings, and glimpse the true secrets of the universe.-There is so much that I want, that sometimes I feel like I’m nothing but want, held tenuously together with skin and bone.-“It’s easier than you might think,” Gideon remarks, as if he can read my thoughts. “For entire civilizations to just be lost. We think of ourselves as permanent, but in a few thousand years, there might not be any trace of us.”-Life and death aren’t so absolute here.-To want nothing is to resemble the gods.-He exists in the inhale and exhale of my breath, the beating of my heart.-The universe roils in my hands. Her fury nearly drives me to my knees.
7337864770	Unhallowed Halls was an absolutely unexpected adventure! It started off full of suspense it felt very *the beginning of a gothic horror movie, you know something is wrong and a few weird things happen but you still have no idea what is going on*. 25% in I started to get some answers but there were still SO many mysteries. Halfway through, this book took a turn and I was shocked! I had no idea *that* was coming, now you may figure it out sooner but I don’t read this genre very often and I loved being flabbergasted! After the twist things get progressively unhinged in the best way and it was practically impossible to put the book down. I expected to enjoy this book I did not expect the genre blending quest I got and it was worth every page! Content wise this is on the more mature side of YA. There is angst, struggle with identity and belonging, and difficult past’s. They are older teens and sex is mentioned but all the on page romance is strictly pg, there is cursing but it isn’t pervasive, a SA from the past is alluded to but not graphically. There are a litany of murders, mostly of children, violence, violent wounds, horrible adults, someone gets eaten but the violence isn’t terribly graphic. If you feel like revisiting the angst of your teenage years with the picturesque backdrop and moody vibes of Scotland give this one a try! Thank you Random House Children’s, Delacorte Press and NetGalley for the opportunity to review this arc, all opinions are my own.
7583816238	It's actually incredible how badly that crashed and burned. The front and back halves of the book feel like completely different stories. My main problem was with the world building. This story, to me, was overly ambitious and tried to pull off high-fantasy level feats in a very underdeveloped urban fantasy setting. Only about halfway through are the fantastical elements and the magical lore, for lack of a better phrase, being introduced and it felt like a huge info-dump. All of these ostentatious explanations and claims about demons, souls, elementals, and Goddess felt so out of place, especially when all of the characters just accept them as fact rather than approach them with any sort of doubt, fear, or even awe. It's jarring compared to the first 150 so pages of this book being solely determined to establish a contemporary dark academia atmosphere, emphasizing how cold and foggy it is, while dropping an Ancient Greece reference in every paragraph. I swear Odysseus (love him what an asshole) is mentioned at least once a chapter. The pacing for this story just felt all over the place and at some point I had to remind myself this is the same story the entire way through. The only thing I consistently enjoyed are the characters, and even then they are a bit underbaked.Unfortunately, the entirety of this book just feels like it cares too much about its aesthetic and cared not at all for the story.
7347842651	If you’re a dark academia fan then the premise of this novel will be both familiar and attractive: an American student with a troubled history is offered a scholarship at an elite boarding school in Scotland.The initial chapters had me hooked. What was Page’s secret that led to a willingness to transfer to Agathion College?; why did the school mascot take against her so violently?; can she trust the clique who seem willing to befriend her?However, as the novel progressed I felt that lots of elements became less clear and the lack of secondary character development made it hard to stay invested. I felt that the author hadn’t quite got a grip on the rules of this world or the mythology behind it and Page’s own story felt equally disappointing and even the fluidity of her sexuality seemed pointlessly woke.For me this was ok but I wouldn’t have listened to the whole book if I hadn’t been reviewing it as it’s too long and not enough happens for swathes of it.Personally, I didn’t love the narration of the audiobook either, with some of the accents being genuinely dreadful. In fairness, there were characters from all over the place, inexplicably thrown together in a Scottish school, so it wasn’t an easy task.With thanks to NetGalley, the author and publisher for an arc of this audiobook in exchange for an honest review.
