6390526559	i love boarding school books.well, usually.this is a creepy spooky fun little book, except for being riddled with low level errors that continually frustrate me. (such as: sade is in bed sometime between 12 am and school starting on a monday, unable to sleep, and then texts one friend to come over and is interrupted by another friend coming over to watch a movie. why would the time for this plan be "bedtime"?)same goes for the twist, and the other twist, and the other twist, and the fact that this cast is made up of 90% seventeen year old boys who are more unilaterally evil than your average dictator, and there's a bizarre amount of animal cruelty (i think this boarding school does science experiments on live guinea pigs?), and the title is pulled from a wildly sexist fictional article in the final pages about how girls make up sa accusations because all they have is beauty (why would that be the title of the book), and the lengthy setup of a creepy teacher plot that is unceremoniously dropped and/or forgotten, and various characters and dynamics that are by the end too.add to all that this has my least favorite young adult trope — I Am Too Busy Solving Crime / Developing Magical Powers / Defeating Evil And Cannot Do My Homework, But I Am Going To Mention It Constantly Just To Give You The Feeling Of That Dream Where You Think You Haven't Attended One Of Your Classes All Semester And Now You Have To Take A Final — and my vibes are all over the place.it wasn't realistic, and it was often frustrating, but it managed to have moments of a dark academia good time.even if it was way too long and still managed to have an abrupt ending.bottom line: please let me start editing books between the first and second edition. i may never adhere to pub deadlines, but i'm annoying enough to catch the errors that slipped through.2.5
6444492534	I wholeheartedly loved this book and added it to my list of best dark academia thrillers and best YA books of the year! It’s dark, sad, intense, heart-wrenching, powerful, and engaging. Some parts made me scream and cry as if somebody had stabbed pieces of glass into my heart! I loved some of the characters and easily connected with them, while I hated and cursed others. My emotions were all over the place. I’m a mess! This powerful #MeToo-vibed dark academia mystery, with Shakespearean tragedy elements about a student’s eccentric vanishing, pushes you to the edge, cooking up theories about what happened to her as the dangerous secrets each student harbors are revealed behind closed doors. The story revolves around Sade Hussein, an orphaned, Black, Muslim girl who has faced tragedy after tragedy, burying each family member starting with her mother’s suicide when she was only 10, and her estranged father’s recent death. She forges his signature to apply to Alfred Nobel Academy to start over, getting away from her aunt, who thinks she brings curse and death everywhere she goes. On her first day, she’s assigned to Turing House, becoming roommates with Elizabeth Wang, who gives her a quick tour and introduces her to her best friend, pink-haired, quick-witted, eccentric Basil (Baz). Sade feels welcomed for the first time in her life, after living a secluded, homeschooled life, but unfortunately, her quick-paced happiness is shattered by Elizabeth’s sudden disappearance. Sade finds herself among the suspects summoned to the headmaster’s office for questioning. To clear her name and for the sake of her new friendship with Basil, she teams up with him to find out what happened to Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the famous Unholy Trinity—nicknamed the academy’s most popular girls, April, Juliette, and Persephone—take her under their wings. She is particularly affected by the magnetic Persephone, who attends English class with her. Let’s not forget that with the help of her new circle, she also finds herself involved with the star swimmer boys' club, including the school’s most popular heartbreaker, April’s ex Jude, and April’s twin brother Augustus, whom she frequently encounters in the swimming lounge.But what if her reason for coming to this academy is related to something more personal, and finding Elizabeth is more crucial than she imagined, revealing darker schemes behind the academy’s closed doors? What if she’s uncovering something more sinister and powerful that risks her life, and despite fighting harder, she is doomed to be defeated by it? I advise you to buy or order your copy and cancel everything in your life to devour it! Overall: Even though this book appears long, it took me only two days to enjoy the full ride, and I honestly couldn’t put it down! This is one of the best mysteries I’ve read, with great twists—some expected, some truly shocking—that left my jaw on the floor! The triggering subjects of rape, abuse, suicide, and grief are not easy to absorb, but the author’s realistic approach to these sensitive issues and well-executed progress make your reading journey worthwhile.Baz and his guinea pig, Muffin, are my favorite characters, and even for them, this book is an extraordinary journey you shouldn’t miss!Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter<

6485358465	wowww what a ride 😮‍💨😮‍💨 lemme process this. RTC
6293653401	Oh wow for a slow burn I really ate this one up!Where Sleeping Girls Lie is about new girl Sade doing her third year in a new boarding school and after her first night she realises that her roommate Elizabeth has disappeared. The plot then takes us on Sade trying to work out the mystery on what happened to Elizabeth but along the way finding out that the prestige Nobel Academy is not all its cracked up to be and has a lot of hidden secrets.If you are used to my reviews its not a shocker that i don't like slow burn thrillers. What i will say about this book is that its more of a character driven mystery and you should not go into this expecting super plots twists, suspense or your 'typical thriller'.The dark academia settings worked well for me and i could really picture the boarding school settings so vivid in my head. The atmosphere felt tense, grey and heavy and really held my attention.I absolutely adore Sade, Persephone and Basil. The author really fleshed out their characters and i was so enamored and drawn to them! The queer representation was brilliantly written and i was cheesing soooo hard when they finally came together. (Not me liking a slow burn romance... what's happening? lol)I really think this book should be read by all young adults as it highlights the touchy subjects of (G)rape culture, SA, misogyny and racial discrimination.This was such a heavy read but I couldn't put the book down and just had to get to the end. The last 20% felt like a whirlwind, one completely unexpected twist and all the explaining of the unanswered questions throughout the book had me like 😮It misses the full 5 star mark for me, because although i ate it up, did it really justify it being 563 pages long... NO. It could have def being cut down to a 350-400 page book. Besides that this was a really good YA mystery! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩Pre Review⋆｡°✩Reasons why I've rushed to read this book... 📝Its a Dark Academia set in a Boarding School ✔️Its said to be a Gripping Mystery ✔️Excuse me, just look at that gorgeous cover art! ✔️Pretty Please Don't Disappoint! 🖤🖤
5934520854	Blog | Instagram Rating: 3.5 stars Cover: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 I was immediately drawn to the striking portrait at the centre of this design, especially with the dripping effects that capture the haunting atmosphere of the story. Besides this, the shadowed boarding school at the bottom of the design adds an extra layer of foreboding and mystery, hinting at the dark secrets hidden within the story's setting. Writing: 🌟🌟🌟🌟 The descriptive writing style is simple yet filled with vivid descriptions that make the narrative eerie and atmospheric. However, the heavy-handed foreshadowing made some of the tension and suspense fall flat for me."sometimes justice looked like this: it wasn't fair, and it wasn't just." Storyline: 🌟🌟🌟 Despite the storyline opening with several intriguing mysteries, it unfurls at a slow pace that delves into the academics and social aspects of the main character's life, making the middle of the book drag. The pace finally picks up in the final third of the book with several twists and revelations that explore serious themes such as rape culture, suicide, grief, and privilege. Main character(s): 🌟🌟🌟 Due to past misfortunes, Sade Hussein suffers from bursts of anxiety that heighten the eerie atmosphere of the story. Sadly, her character remained mysterious and one-dimensional for most of the story, which made it hard for me to connect with or root for her."The best liars… were the ones who were also lying to themselves in some way." Secondary characters: 🌟🌟🌟🌟 A diverse crew of secondary characters supports Sade in her investigations and contributes to the explored themes. These generally had distinct traits and personalities that made them memorable. In particular, Basil (Baz) was my favourite, as his character is heartwarmingly genuine. Romance: 🌟🌟🌟🌟 While the romantic subplot was somewhat confusing due to several possible connections, the cute slow-burn romance Sade experiences is filled with clear attraction and gradually develops as the characters spend time together. An additional romance between two secondary characters also gradually unfolds, providing more cute moments."Not many people get it. How losing someone changes you." Narration & Audio: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Several audio effects and Natalie Simpson's fitting narration, complete with varied accents, truly enriched this story and made the audiobook immersive. On the whole, 'Where Sleeping Girls Lie' skilfully explores powerful cultural messages through intriguing mysteries, but the slow pacing and underdeveloped main character made it less captivating. For those who enjoyed this book, I highly recommend We Should All Be Feminists by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
5898711828	Thanks to NetGalley for an eARC in exchange for an honest review. 2.5/5I didn’t love Ace of Spades but I wanted to give the author another try. I love stories set at a school, so this sounded up my alley. It started off really strong with creepy vibes and hints towards something dark that happened in the MC’s past. I loved the setting of the school and I thought all the people— students, teachers, staff— she met felt authentic and like real people. I was really into the story but then it kept going and it kept going and we weren’t getting anywhere. This is over 400 pages I think? And honestly 250ish, max 300 is where it should’ve stopped. The pacing started to slow before the midway point and I began to lose interest. We spent too much time on day to day that didn’t move the plot forward. The resolution was fine, I guess. Maybe this author just isn’t for me. I’ll round up to 3 stars.
6082623635	Powerful story about sexual assault and misogyny in an English boarding school, but it gets bogged down by mundane day-to-day school and personal/interpersonal drama.If this was trimmed down into a tighter story, then I think it would've been more impactful.
6979443952	The last book I read by Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé was, like most people, the phenomenal Ace of Spades. My toxic trait? I often forget the exact reasons I loved or disliked a book—yet I remember Ace of Spades had me hooked. So my expectations were high going into this one, and after reading the description, my excitement spiked even more. From the start, the tension was real. At points, I felt like the plot was losing me, veering off in unexpected ways, but eventually, everything came together beautifully, each twist making perfect sense in the end.The story's vibe was all classic boarding school, a setting that always amps up the thrill factor. This atmosphere allowed for some seriously unsettling moments, and I’ll admit, I was uncomfortable more than once. The characters? Yes, they’re somewhat “typical” high school personalities, but somehow each one stands out. The forming of friendships was a huge highlight for me—they're all so unique, and it’s inspiring seeing them accept one another exactly as they are. I love romance as much as the next person, but honestly, watching these friendships grow felt just as satisfying. And don’t worry, if you’re in it for romance, there’s a bit of that here too.Now, onto our main character. Let’s face it: a bad lead can sink an entire book. Not Sade though. She’s smart, layered, and it wasn’t until deep into the story that I realized how much I didn’t know about her. The things she reveals—wow. I felt a little betrayed, like, “Aren’t we besties?” But the mystery behind her motivations kept me invested, and I found myself rooting for her more with every page. I’d definitely want to hang out with her; she’s both sharp and passionate, an unforgettable presence.As for takeaways, while the book didn’t introduce any new life lessons, it was a harsh reminder of the real-life horrors lurking in the world. It left me feeling that we all need to keep pushing for a safer, fairer world, especially for women.The ending? It was spot-on—not predictable, but also not too far-fetched. I can see why this book’s gaining traction, and I hope it continues to get the hype it deserves!
6062580091	I love that the title is a play on Let Sleeping Dogs Lie which is “a request for a matter or incident to remain undiscussed or avoided, where addressing it might cause trouble.”Which is very relevant once you’ve read the book…I devoured this book over the weekend and really enjoyed it, this was a great YA take on dark academia with engaging characters that you will love and hate and a dark real life topic that I think Faridah handled perfectly. I don’t want to say too much as I feel like the topic this book deals with is a spoiler so I will just say go in blind and let the storytelling and mystery take you on a journey.
6455886298	book rating: ••••.25audiobook rating: •••.5 ‘keep swimming. or if that’s too hard, at the very least, float.’ *sighs* this is book proves that do not trust men (even the ones who act innocent, but they have a secret)i kinda get it that the book is slow-paced (based on some updates). but while i was listening to the audiobook, i finally understand on what was happening behind elizabeth's disappearance.speaking of elizabeth's disappearance, her side story got me shocked (view spoiler)[also, jamila, sade's sister, side story got the same reaction (hide spoiler)]oh, the clues? yep, i kept hunching them chapter per chapter. some of them were right, but the majority of them are wrong especially the (view spoiler)[tg part because i have no fücking clue who is this (hide spoiler)]to be honest, my head is still throbbing after reading this. but i enjoy it nonetheless.for the audiobook, natalie simpson's narration is okay. but at some parts, she sounded like a female google translator. but i like her voice when she va'ed persephone.───────────────────────pre-read:so this is the book pick for the book club on the bird app. and i know it's dark academia + sapphic (and it's chunky!) so i guess i might enjoy this 🤭
6238788287	I am devastated to report that this book was a huge miss from me. The plot doesn’t pick up until about 60% in, despite an intriguing start, and honestly the focus is so different than what we’re led to expect from the beginning (in a way that isn’t a cleverly hidden twist but instead more like a sudden U-turn through the median on the freeway). The beginning and random snippets throughout tease us with this dead girl, but honestly she’s not relevant to much of anything except to try to make our main girl Sade doubt herself. Until we finally figure out who she is in a huge infodump at about 80%. And then we get another infodump at 88% to explain the red herring plot that we were fed in the beginning and occasionally reminded of throughout.Also, these kids don’t speak like kids. There’s no slang; they talk super formally - and occasionally that’s mentioned as kind of a joke (like “oh you sound like Jane Austen”) but it’s constant across all the characters that you can’t even make a joke like that land. And so often characters are referred to by their one defining characteristic (ie “the blonde-haired girl” or “he of the ice blue eyes” - I kid you not) when we know everyone’s names pretty much right away.Once we did finally hit that 67% mark, though, the plot was off like a shot, to the point where it felt like a totally different book. Revelations were coming at us right and left, with perilous consequences; but they flew by so fast they didn’t have time to land. Could have used more of the real estate taken up by nothing much in the first half to lend weight to the later events. And I will say I liked the resolution.But the whole thing lacked the impact, the tension that Ace of Spades nailed so well.{Thank you FierceReads for the advanced copy in exchange for my honest review}
6823481467	2.5/5 ⭐️- If you love a good mystery, you’ll really enjoy this one! I went into this book feel like it would be more of a thriller, but it definitely gives mystery vibes. If you enjoy putting puzzle pieces together to solve a murder, you have to pick this one up! I don’t enjoy reading mysteries so if I had known this was going to be more of that vibe, I probably wouldn’t have picked this one up.- This is such an important story to tell, but the way it was told left me wanting more. the pacing felt slow for me, but it really sped up in the last 100 pages which really kept me hooked!!- It’s easy to compare this book to Ace of Spades (which I LOVED), but this story wasn’t my favorite. Can definitely see mystery lovers enjoying this one though!

6843117870	Depois de “Às de Espadas” que adorei, não resisti e tive a obrigatoriedade de ler igualmente este. E deixem-me dizer que foi uma montanha russa de emoções . Fiquei envolvida logo no primeiro capítulo . A Sade era uma miúda nova no colégio e como ela também eu ia descobrindo o lugar, todos os alunos e funcionários. A autora esteve muito bem. 👏🏻 O Ambiente sombrio e misterioso ajudou a criar o cenário perfeito. Estava sempre com um mau pressentimento a virar cada página…e mesmo sendo um livro grande só descansei até descobrir tudo. A parte final 😨😨 aiiii que reviravoltas e informações atrás de informações. As personagens foram muito bem pensadas. Cheias de camadas, misteriosas e foram desenvolvidas a medida que a história avançava . Foi uma historia de sobrevivência e coragem 🥹 tenham em atenção porque tem alguns temas pesados como o racismo, discriminação, luto , ódio , violência , morte entre outros… mas não deixem de o ler , não vão conseguir ficar indiferentes a esta história. ✨
6446530568	Where Sleeping Girls Lie has left a lasting impact since I read it earlier this year. I have always adored dark academia, and was hoping this book would be another decent addition to the genre, but what I found here was something unique, meaningful, and so emotionally charged. I cherished every page of this powerful novel. This novel had all the suspense of a Shakespearean tragedy, and I was entirely bewitched by the unravelling mystery. The twists and turns were incredible, particularly one towards the end of the novel that truly made me gasp. If you’re looking for a suspenseful dark academia novel, you’ll find that in Where Sleeping Girls Lie, but this book is so much more, in the best way imaginable. The author superbly navigates some of the most difficult topics, telling an important story through sensitive and compelling prose. The boarding school setting was the perfect place to explore rape culture and how the system protects the perpetrators and blames the victims. This is a story of survival and trauma that should be read by everyone. I’ll be thinking about this story for a long time, and I hope it will have as much of an impact on others as it did on me. The sapphic romance was well-woven alongside the main storyline and was a lovely addition. The full cast of characters were so distinct and interesting. Everyone had a purpose and a place within the mystery. Basil was my favourite character. Ironically, I was listening to the audiobook and playing on my Nintendo Switch when it was mentioned that Baz was doing the exact same. I love listening to audiobooks when I’m doing something else because my brain is impossible to please, yet there were so many moments when this book made me freeze in place and immerse myself in this incredible story. I cannot recommend this enough. This was definitely my favourite book of 2024 and I hope I’ll inspire at least someone to pick up this masterpiece. Thank you to the publisher for sending me an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I post about queer books on: Instagram Twitter TikTok
6417136000	** spoiler alert ** 0.5/5 stars page count 398. i’m so mad at everyone that hyped this book up bc this has to be one of the worst books i’ve ever read. the messages are important and i loved the diversity of the cast but the execution was absolutely awful. every single character was flat and had no personality. i couldn’t tell between them. it read like a really bad coming of age tv show with every trope imaginable in the words and sentence structure. not a single original thought or sentence or interaction in the entire book. it was painfully slow and extremely boring and the mystery was ass and its resolutions were so boring and the ending was way too happy ending and unrealistic. (yes i know not everything was ideal but everything worked out perfectly for all our central characters at the last second). you’re telling me a rich white and affluent family will settle for just money after their son was murdered and the girl accused doesn’t have to do ANY jail time? NONE? she just gets to walk around freely? absolutely none of the reveals were interesting in the least i was unbelievably bored the entire time. also so much was vague??? like i had to churn my brain for so long to understand half of what was happening. but then she’d also draw out the most pointless and boring interactions? also the inconsistencies drove me absolutely insane. for example the book later referenced a painting the narrator had seen when she first entered the school that WAS NEVER MENTIONED I REREAD THAT FIRST CHAPTER THREE TIMES TO MAKE SURE. the book read like a really flat really boring summary. the structure was bad. the book kept flip flopping between opposing things “she could never enter the water again bc it triggered her” three pages later “the only place she ever feels free is in the water” WHICH IS IT???? also so many sub plot seeds were badly planted that amounted to absolutely NOTHING. NOTHING. she also tried to be interesting by adding in a morse code for the reader to decipher and some interrogation room transcript but the morse code took fucking forever and was pointless as fuck and the random shift to the TWO interrogation transcripts was so weird and jarring and brought absolutely nothing to the story. i know what she was trying to do and this book could have been really good but the execution was truly so bad. this was a huge waste of my time and money
5954487798	I (like everyone else) loved Ace of Spades and thought it was one of the best YA thrillers in recent years - so I was STOKED to start Where Sleeping Girls Lie.After finishing the book and reflecting on it a little I decided I really loved it - but I think it's best to go into it with the proper expectations or you may be disappointed.Where Sleeping Girls Lie is about Sade, a teenage girl starting at a new boarding school. She recently lost her father and the author alludes that she may be running from some dark secrets in her past. The day after she arrives to school, her new roommate goes missing. Sade spends most of the story trying to figure out what happened to her roommate while also getting acclimated to the school, its cliques and rules, etc. - I would not call this a thriller. It leans more towards the mystery side and I think a lot of that has to do with the pacing, which is very moderate. I don't think this is a bad thing by any means, but I do think it's good to know going into it that this isn't a twisty page turner that will have you on the edge of your seat. It is more of a slow burn, and instead of "solving the mystery" being the motivation to keep reading, in my case it was just learning more about Sade and seeing how her relationships evolved. - The author did a GREAT job creating all of these characters. I think memorable characters are one of most important parts of a good book, especially for those of us who read 100+ books a year. It is so easy for characters to just be vessels for the plot that blend into the story, but I think the main characters all stood out in their own ways and I appreciated their complexities. - IMO this was a little longer than it needed to be. I think it could've been 50 pages shorter and that would've held my attention more consistently.I will read anything this author writes! I would also definitely not complain if she turned this one into a series... just saying.*Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the free ARC in exchange for an honest review*
6008189055	Took a while to get good, but when it did, it was really good. Hate books like this, but we need books like this. Need to keep exposing the light on toxic masculinity and toxic male privilege. Need to stop protecting boys behaving badly and start protecting our girls more.
6259660441	If you were trapped in an elevator with me and you had to listen to me pitch this novel I’d say picture Mean Girls meets Èlite but with a BIPOC queer cast and a Black Muslim girl as the main character of a YA contemporary mystery set at an elite, private boarding school in England. Interested yet?The insane thing is that halfway through this book I had to find out the author is one year younger than I am! Can you imagine what that knowledge has done to me?? She’s younger than me and not only a NYT bestselling author but has just published her second novel?? Irreparable damage as well as ten years off my life, that’s what that knowledge has done to me. Àbíké-Íyímídé deserves it, though, she’s truly that girl!! 💖🍬🩰🎀If I had to summarise the novel’s premise in a few, short sentences I’d say it’s about Sade Hussein, who has been homeschooled all her life, which, through a series of tragic incidents, has been turned upside down, leading her to start her third year of high school at the Alfred Nobel Academy. On the first day, she begins to befriend her roommate Elizabeth, who disappears after Sade’s first night. While Sade teams up with Elizabeth’s best friend Baz to find out what happened to her, she also catches the attention of the three most popular girls at school known as the “Unholy Trinity”. Sade feels herself drawn to Persephone, who is one of the Unholy girls, which leads to her getting tangled up in the social food chain though everything culminates when a student is found dead.There are two things, that this book does really well:The first is creating that boarding school meets mystery thriller atmosphere that has the characters attend English lit classes on Shakespeare in the morning and try to solve a missing person and murder case in the evening. While I wouldn’t describe the atmosphere as gothic, this novel has a ton of dark academia vibes going for it and I’m not even a DA fan but this intrigued me. 🕵🏻‍♀️The second is that while it’s definitely more of a slow-burn thriller and while the narrative is propelled forward not by an insane number of plot twists or suspense, it’s a very character-driven novel and that mainly shows in how Sade and all the others secondary characters are granted a lot of depth as well as room to grow and for the reader to explore them. None of the secondary characters, and later on suspects and potential murderers, felt superfluent or unnecessary. It can be quite tricky to balance a larger cast of characters and have every one of them feel like valuable add-ons to the narrative but the author skilfully bounces to and from between them, picking up a lead or train of thought just when you think it has gone cold.As a character, Sade herself is a bit on the quiet side even though a lot is going on inside of her as she has to deal with great childhood trauma. She is reserved, but intelligent, clever, and has an iron backbone. Overall, she makes for an interesting foil to some of the more extroverted, outgoing characters such as Baz – or Basil, and together they make a really great platonic sleuthing duo situated in a very balanced power dynamic (just two queer babies solving crime and kicking ass).In general, the book is big on themes of friendship and platonic relationships and themes of same-sex as well as inter-sex friendships. There is a slow-burn sapphic romantic relationship going on/slowly developing between Persephone and Sade who are both evenly matched inside as well as outside the classroom but it’s more of an on-the-side storyline and not the novel’s main focus.Among other topics, this book explores r@pe culture, s€xual assault, misogyny (in the media), and racial discrimination but it does so in a way that to me, felt absolutely appropriate for a YA readership. It’s part of what makes the novel and its modern-day setting believable as all of the themes above are incredibly current.My two minor complaints would be that the paperback edition clocks in at 400 pages which, well, isn’t earth-shattering but it’s not a little for a YA mystery book. Its length is a result of a lot of over-detailed scene-setting and descriptions that are given at all times. The author seemed to have been very keen on relaying every single detail about a character’s actions such as hand or body movement, a room’s furniture or setting up the environs of a conversation that at times almost distracted from the actual scene or conversation.What I also found a little weird is that whenever the characters used social media, no names were used. So instead of saying “Sade opened Instagram/X/TikTok/…” it was always something similar to “Sade opened her social media app” or “She checked the messages she’d been getting on her social media account”. I don’t quite know why this was done because there are a lot of other brands that are name-checked but yeah, it is what it is.All in all, a more than solid debut-follow-up. After I read Ace of Spades I knew I was going to pick up whatever the author would put out next and this novel really didn’t disappoint me. Four stars from me.
6802539388	“Boys with everything. The world had been and always would be theirs for the taking. Sade had learned to fear the men who had everything, because even the moon, the skies and the earth could not sate them.”overall, incredibly impactful and emotional. a bleak but honest examination of the power of the rich and elite and the institutions they reign over.this was definitely a slowburn. i would say the first half could be tightened up bc it truthfully did almost lose me (it felt almost like a repeat of ace of spades) BUT i'm glad i continued bc the meat and heart of the story is in the second half.i kind of also have mixed feelings on the end. on the one hand, i see how having a more realistic ending matches the tone and allows the emotional weight and impact of the story. on the other hand, i wonder if it would be cathartic for some readers to have a best-case ending.overall, fantastically done.Keep swimming. Or if that’s too hard, at the very least, float.
6220062132	I understand the importance of this story in several ways, but it's definitely too long & Ace of Spades is superior, but this one's written just as well. I just wish it were more unique or maybe supernatural in its reveals. I will say the audiobook is great though!
6364123225	RTC!! (This one was so good, y’all 😭)
6084373337	Where Sleeping Girls Lie is a YA mystery set at an elite boarding school in England! I went into this with very high expectations because I LOVED Ace of Spades. I didn't love this one as much, but I still quite liked it. Sade is a new student starting mid-term, but weird things are going on and her roommate disappears. Sade is a practicing Muslim and probably bisexual, which is cool if done in a lowkey kind of way. This is definitely a slow-burn that takes its time with developing side characters. Which is something I generally like, but I think this one could have been shaved down. It kind of drags through the middle and bit of a faster pace would have been more engaging. I also think more things needed to go wrong for Sade. As she's investigating, she does a lot of risky things but it almost always goes off without a hitch and throwing a wrench into the works mid-book would have been a bit more interesting. That said, I loved the characters and the atmosphere, and I would read more set in this world. I did feel like I wanted a bit more from the ending but I also get what it's doing and I don't want to spoil anything. Call it a mild case of sophomore slump, but this is still a very good book and I look forward to more from the author in the future! The audio narration feels immersive in terms of place and setting. I received an audio review copy via NetGalley, all opinions are my own.Content warnings include death, sexual assault (not super graphic, mostly off-page), sexual harassment, panic attacks, halucinations, drugging.
6160591193	This book simply may have not been for me. I know it's targeted at the YA audience and I'm way beyond that but I find a lot of YA literature brilliant and Where Sleeping Girls Lie certainly started out that way with the sudden disappearance of Elizabeth Wang.Sade Hussein is new to Alfred Nobel Academy after finding herself alone following the deaths of her mother, then twin sister and father. A lifetime of home schooling and a strict upbringing hasn't given her any grounding for boarding school so she's delighted to make friends with Elizabeth and Basil (Baz) as soon as she arrives.After Elizabeth's strange midnight disappearance the story then rambles on for a few hundred pages, occasionally giving the reader little hints about various goings on at the school. It is here where the book lost me. I trudged through wondering when anything was going to happen but instead all there was, was general school stuff. The action barely picks up until the final few chapters. Even then the denouement manages to drag on for several chapters.I know it's an overused saying that a book needs a good edit and if I'd written a novel I'd not be happy about a reviewer saying that. So I will only say that, for me, the action was too sporadic, the conclusion of an actual crime was ridiculous and despite this book bringing up some very serious issues it felt as though the author was simply saying that things take time to change and we have to be patient. Not a great thing for any young woman to hear.Thanks to Netgalley and Usborne Publishing for the advance review copy.
6380641942	3.5 StarsVideo Review https://youtu.be/dFyDuswyDncI adored Ace of Spades by the same author so I was eager to read this new release. The premise was arguably quite similar but I didn't mind. I was fine to read more of the same.However this one started awfully slow and took a long time to get going. Unlike the author's debut, this one lacked the early juicy hook. Instead I had to push through for the sake of this review. Thankfully the story ended really strong and I was ultimately glad I waited it out. The story had some more serious subject matter than Ace of Spades which landed to a more serious tone and less juicy.I would definitely read whatever the author writes next and will likely reread Ace of Spades in the meantime. Disclaimer I received a copy of this book from the publisher.
4189543258	Yesssssss I was so excited for this book and I’m so glad it was worth the wait. So many things about this book were LAYERED. There was so much symbolism and imagery and reading it was an EXPERIENCE. When the title made sense, I had to take a minute because it was a gut punch. It’s a really heavy book because there’s so many different types of trauma on display and there’s so much I want to say but I want you all to experience it just like I did and I don’t want to give anything away. The writing was beautiful and brilliant the plot was top notch and the characters were so interesting and eccentric and apart from my baby Sade, Persephone and Basil were my favourites. The setting was so good and the way the surroundings were written into the story, you’d know that the author took her time with the school, the buildings, and it’s almost like you’re walking through the halls with the students. I can’t wait for more people to read this. Preorder if you haven’t. This is THE YA book of 2024. Gosh.
6401531964	3.5 StarsI am super conflicted this review as I feel like the ending was so worth it and the message behind this book is so important but it just took TOO long to get there.I absolutely loved the dark academia setting, the sapphic representation and of course muffin. The pacing was not right for me. I buddy read this with Ashley and we both agreed, Elizabeth went missing at the very beginning of this book and it was like she was then forgotten about, instead everyone was just trying to find out what she knew instead of actually her. (view spoiler)[Then when she was eventually found, it wasn't really that much of a big deal as the focus was on the reveal. (hide spoiler)]100 pages less would of made no difference to the story.

7729376493	Dark Academia isn't my jam so I probably didn't really have any business picking up this book, but that gorgeous cover, I couldn't resist. I thought it was a bit on the too long side but I really like the way Àbíké-Íyímídé created characters that made sense as teenagers, complete with the non-sensical serpentine plans where way more straightforward plans would have sufficed, teenage logic you know? I was quite fond of Baz, colorful hair and a guinea pig named Muffin he's clearly one of my people!
6678165724	THIS PACKED A PUNCH. One that will leave me winded and agonising over for weeks.This book is multi-genre. Marketed as a suspense mystery, this is also a coming of age, a dark academia, a contemporary literary drama, romance, and thriller. Part anti-hero journey.Sade (SHAH-DAY) arrives for the third year at of Alfred Nobel Academy after her father’s death, leaving his multi-million-pound estate, and the burden of grief and the awkwardness that came with leaving a string of deaths behind her to anyone who gets close to her. Alfred Nobel Academy is filled with luxury and Sade knows all too well wealth leads to secrets buried six feet under. Shortly after arriving, her roommate disappears. This is about dealing with mental health, trauma, grief, guilt. This discusses how corrupt our world is. The apparent lack of consequences it seemed there is for the well-connected. Money does buy happiness - through security, hush hush, celebrity…. "Are you okay?" She hated asking that question when she knew the answer was so obvious.It was something she hated being asked herself, especially after the many tragedies in her life.Are you okay is what people ask when they don't know what else to say. It's an easy question for the asker, but an unbearable one for the asked.This had the potential to be over-the-top and cringy. There’s an Unholy Trinity. There’s a popular clique who adopts Sade. The matron seems to hate her. There’s a play boy who’s the prince of the school who has his eyes on Sade. How the author pulled this all together to keep you on the edge of your seat, gritting your teeth, and bracing yourself. "You know what gets me through really tough times?" Sade said.“What?” She asked."I tell myself to keep swimming, and if I can't do that, if that's too hard, I simply float."Baz has my heart by the way. Him, his unhealthy jammy dodger obsession, and Muffin who he rescued (stole) from being a biology experiment. Baz is chaotic in the best way and I loved his endearing, supportive, funny self. This reads older YA with deep and dark themes. However, there is no content which would make it inadvisable for slightly younger YA readers! Thank you to Pan MacMillan for gifting the physical book in exchange for a review!Bookstagram
6375936171	Desnecessariamente longo
6008482623	This hurts but this was boring and didn’t really pick up until like 65% off the way through. 🫤
6414042273	An (unacknowledged) Mean Girls retelling that had me screaming “WHHHYYYY” for all the wrong reasons. The lightbulbs?? The hamster?? The “twist”??? It was too much.
5106136852	Thank you netgalley and check CW/TW before starting this book. This would make a great HBO limited series! This book starts off really slow and only picks up by the 60% mark and while some readers might be annoyed by this, I enjoyed the slow pace. Sometimes a book needs to start off slow to be good and this is one of them.When you realize why this is called Where Sleeping Girls Lie, you will feel sick to your stomach and as the story continues the worse it gets. But as much as I liked this book, I do think that the execution could have been better, but maybe that’s just me being wishful and hoping for more.
6177817269	Wow, all I can say is wow. At first I was a bit intimidated by the length of this book, but the story telling had me in a chokehold. I was so wrapped up in what was happening at this academy that I was stuck in the pages of this book."Where Sleeping Girls Lie" is such a damn good book. The plot twists, the revelations, the secrets, the updates and even the anagram. I laughed, I rooted for these kids, I cried and found myself deeply disgusted and appalled. This is a book I want a physical copy of. I borrowed it from my library, but I definitely want to revisit this book. To see if now that I understand how the story unfolds, if I can actually recognize the lead ups to the twists and revelations. This book was very well written. I'm still torn up and can't believe we've gotten to the end of story.
5908218195	Incisive and devastatingly insightful, Àbíké-Íyímídé rends a thriller in which every character is hiding painful secrets from themselves and each other, and true to life, justice is a hard-won thing. Where Sleeping Girls Lie paints an honest portrait of the rage of teenage girls and the catharsis found thereafter.
4741004196	Thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for the ARC. It hasn't affected the content of my review.Don't go in expecting another thriller like Ace of Spades and you'll be fine. This is more of a straight mystery than Íyímídé's debut; it is slower paced and there is both more passing of actual time in the story, and time spent with characters just talking to each other. In a way, it's a lot more atmospheric than Ace of Spades. It sort of traded in the propulsive speedy plot for something more considered and setting focused. Her school, Alfred Nobel Academy, feels like it was a lot of fun to create, and the elaborate school politics and a student body full of rich kids and scholarship kids is the perfect place to tell a story like this one.Our main character is Sade Hussein, orphan, whose father just died weeks before she enters a prestigious English boarding school. She has been homeschooled her entire life, and her childhood was marked by multiple tragedies. Right away there's a sense that she is at the school for a purpose, even if it's just to try on independence for the first time (her father never would have let her come). But this is a narration style, that while pretty close, does keep some things back from the reader, and the result of that is that we often see Sade doing things without explanation that we wonder about. I thought it was very clever. The prose, while nothing stunning, does its job, and I was liking the characters I was supposed to like within about fifty pages. This is quite a long book for YA, but it reads pretty fast. The audiobook narration of this was great. Natalie Simpson did a wonderful job, and I would be more likely to check out a book if I saw she had narrated it. Even though I liked this book slightly less than her debut, I will definitely read more of this author's stuff. What's she's doing with YA is super interesting, and I'm still super interested to see what kinds of books she starts coming out with as a more seasoned author.
6395250701	I’ve been reading YA thrillers for over ten years and Where Sleeping Girls Lie is, without question, one of the best I’ve come across during that time. This is the epitome of a powerhouse novel. Taking on themes of grief and mental illness, as well as toxic masculinity, rape culture and the systems and institutions that uphold them, Where Sleeping Girls Lie is powerful in its message, without being overbearing or patronising towards its readers. It’s nuanced and careful in its approach to discussing these topics, whilst in no way sugarcoating or trauma baiting. In terms of the characters, each cast member of this book is well developed, memorable and has a genuine place in the story. They’re multifaceted teens with complexities and portray the variety of different ways people experience and process trauma and privilege.All in all, I thought this was a truly outstanding story that’s both a tension filled thriller and a somber exploration of inequality, power and abuse. This is a superbly written book and one I cannot wait to shout about. TW: rape, racism, sexual assault, mental illness, suicide
5602562305	Where Sleeping Girls Lie is one of the best YA mysteries I’ve ever read. If you’re expecting a fast paced thriller this is not the book for you. The mystery was well paced with interesting characters and with a plot that was fleshed out amazingly. The book was long, but I never felt bored by the story. It all felt like it was building to something insane and I was not disappointed. This mystery just had so many different angles and moving parts and the author does an amazing job at bringing it all together in the end. There are very heavy topics discussed and the author handled it with so much care. Sade was the perfect character for us readers to follow because as we learn about the mystery of the boarding school, mysteries surrounding her life before were also uncovered. This was just so well done and I’m honestly kicking myself for not reading this sooner. Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé has become a must read author for me and it just shows that sometimes an incredible book takes time but it’s worth it in the end.
4144369412	Faridah’s mind 🤯 my favourite thing is that she is able to find the horror in our everyday lives and a sexist,racist system. It makes the horror even more chilling. The pace is slow and I actually liked that the mystery was kind of set in the background as it allowed us to get to know the characters and the dynamics more. I loved this
6433033566	4.5/5 stars the perfect blend of contemporary and thriller. and, as always, FUCK rich people and men!
5827176975	Thank you Coloredpages, NetGalley, and Fierce Reads for my #gifted copy. Where Sleeping Girls Lie is a contemporary mystery that keeps you hanging in suspense. Sade (SHAH-DAY) is the new kid on the block, and she’s harboring secrets while uncovering the secret of her new roommate's disappearance. Sade plans to uncover the secrets of her new school as she finds out what happened to her new roommate Elizabeth. This book is a long journey to find out what’s happening; honestly, it was way too long for this reader, but I will say the message behind the book is good. It just could’ve been done with fewer pages, in my opinion. It presents an opportunity to explore just how sinister private institutions can be, what they do to protect wrongdoers, and how careless they are when it comes to protecting young women. I’d recommend this one if you loved the author's previous work (Ace of Spades), like long suspenseful and multi-layered stories. 3.5/5⭐️
6200347986	It’s hard not to compare to Ace of Spades but yet here i am. The book was okay. Covered a very serious topic and the story line was there. Please be careful and read the triggers. I get the importance of the topic, however, i feel like this book could have been wrapped up in at least 200 pages. It was seriously too long. Now the second half going into the last 30% or so left of the book things popped off. We got lots of shocking things, twist and understanding. After that i closed the book and let the audio finish.
6200985264	4.5 stars rounded up. I feel much feminine rage and want a cup of tea.
4731569201	This book is everything that 13 Reasons Why tried to be. 13/10, will always be thinking of this book.
6209022679	I knew Ace of Spades was going to be hard to live up to, and this book didn't. It was still a good read, but one that had me feeling less invested.It took me quite a long time to get into this. At around the 30% mark I felt like things were finally starting to become interesting. And the second half was definitely a lot stronger. But plot driven books don't work very well for me unless I develop a close attachment to the characters, which didn't happen in this book. I didn't find the characters particularly interesting, and I didn't feel like I got to know them very well at all.
6507877246	4.0⭐️Intriguing dark academia wrapped around the mystery of a missing roommate. This is my first novel by Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé but certainly won’t be the last. I look forward to reading Ace of Spades next. Where Sleeping Girls Lie is a YA novel written with a mature voice, it doesn’t shy away from dark content and subject matter. This one’s a serious page-turner with characters who feel realistic because they’re so well developed. The tension is palpable and claustrophobic within the halls of this exclusive and sinister boarding school. I love that Àbíké-Íyímídé shines light upon the systemic sexism, racism, and classism that runs rampant among these inherently patriarchal and whitewashed institutions. This is an impressive novel by a writer I’ll be keeping my eye on henceforth.
6626102298	Este livro foi uma experiência memorável, diverti-me imenso com os enigmas e com as personagens. Adorei cada parte dele 🥰
4730169378	Where Sleeping Girls Lie is a young adult mystery about Sade Hussein, new girl at the prestigious boarding school: Alfred Noble Academy, who discovers dark secrets amongst the school after her roommate disappears without a trace. This was one of my top 3 most anticipated releases for 2024 and I have some things I loved about it and some things I hated. Let’s get into it.I was hooked from literally the first page! (Honestly from the author’s note! I really appreciated the mention of Oluwatoyin Salau) The writing gripped me immediately and I was IN LOVE! I loved the atmosphere of the novel. The dark academia vibe is going to get me every time! I loved several of the characters. Sade, Persephone, & Baz were so amazing and their chemistry was perfect! I enjoyed other characters as well! As a huge Mean Girls fan (it’s literally my favorite movie of all time), I absolutely LOVED all the subtle, and not-so-subtle, Mean Girls references! And I also loved the unreliable narrator feel to Sade’s POV!But the pacing of this novel was sooooo slow! Even toward the beginning of the novel, I was loving it so much, but it felt like no matter how much I was reading I couldn’t make any progress. I feel like the book could’ve been at least 60 pages shorter. And it’s not that a whole lot of unnecessary things were happening, it’s that they should’ve happened quicker & more succinctly. I also don’t like that it took so long for us to know ANYTHING. I feel like it would’ve been much better if the story unfolded little by little rather than a whole bunch of build up and then everything gets dumped on you at the end. Speaking of the end, the end was the slowest part… We went in circles forever and it just kept going and going. I just wanted them to get to the point. And by the time the truth was finally revealed, I didn’t care anymore. Plus the reveals were disappointing. My theories were way more interesting than what actually happened. And I was left with several questions at the end. Multiple things were alluded to as part of the mystery and then were never revisited. I think this novel would be better as an hour-and-a-half long movie because the pacing could be much faster and the story can stay interesting!I do appreciate the commentary in this novel and I enjoyed several things about it like the characters and atmosphere, but the pacing really dampened my enjoyment. Maybe I was comparing it to this author’s previous novel, Ace of Spades, because it was super fast paced and I expected the same energy in this one. But slow pace never really works for me, so people that enjoy slow burn mysteries may enjoy this more!Thank you to Netgalley and Feiwel and Friends for this arc. All opinions are my own.TW: sexual assault (non-graphic but a recurring theme), misogyny, suicide, death of a parent, child neglect, domestic abuse (briefly mentioned), and discussions of grief
6230509412	I really enjoyed this book. The setting/atmosphere, the characters, the plot were so so good. Also the twists!! omgThe only thing that bothered me was that I feel like it didn't really need to be as long as it was. I feel like there was a good chunk of time in this book where... nothing was really happening? Idk lol maybe that's just me. Overall, I really enjoyed it and I love Faridah's writing and the social issues and messages she incorporates into her stories. <33
5743966647	This is one of those books that I don’t feel like I can say anything about without spoiling. How do reviewers of thriller/mysteries even do this? Anyway, it was very dark and very heavy but also very good!

The book deals with important topics such as the dangers of drugs, the abuse of girls and the fact that hardly anyone believes them. Since this is also a problem in our real world I think the content of this book is even more important. Sometimes while I was reading, I was so angry that this is actually happening and not enough is being done about it. This book deserves so much more attention!! idk if someone actually reads until here but if you did thanks <3 pls consider reading this book
6371340955	I found the book to be enjoyable, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations after reading Ace Of Spades. The book's pacing was relatively slow, and it wasn't until chapter 38 that the story started to pick up and become more engaging.

Definitely 3.5 stars rounded up. I would have loved it to be just a tad shorter but it was still enjoyable. Dark & dramatic, this story is compelling and will have you entertained. This is my first book by this author and I will read more! Ace of Spades is still on my TBR!Where Sleeping Girls lie is out now! Happy reading 📖

Rep: Sade (MC) is POC, sapphic, and an orphan. Side POC characters. Side lesbian POC character. Side queer characters. When this book was announced, I was so beyond excited for it! I absolutely loved Ace of Spades (I've read it twice, and yes, it's heavy but holy crap is it worth it). So I knew this would be another one I am excited about.The book was slow to start with, but it really sets the scene - which is important. In true Faridah style, there are many bits you need to pay close attention to throughout the story.Sade's character is so interesting, and so complex - she's an orphan, who was previously only home schooled, going to a boarding school for the first time ever. If that isn't enough to make you go !! then the rest of the book absolutely will.The school she goes to has dark, sinister secrets, and Sade is unexpectedly thrown into it when her roommate goes missing. From there, she is desperate to figure out what is going on, and exactly what a group called The Fisherman may have to do with her disappearance. The writing and the plot hooked me and I was absolutely desperate to know what happened next. This is a long book, so don't go into it thinking you'll be able to be done and dusted with it quickly, because you probably won't. This took me longer to read than I anticipated because I was so damn sick while reading it. Thankfully, audiobooks exist! Even with that, I still felt like the book was a little too long in parts? Which is a shame. It just made it feel like there was something missing for me, which is why this is 4 stars and not 5. I still recommend it to literally everyone though, because it was that good.
6281721693	I wanted to like this book so much more than I did. I had high hopes, y’all. And while the ending was good (on a likert scale: satisfactory), Where Sleeping Girls Lie, just didn’t fully pan out for me. I know it did for others, but not here. The ending is honestly what brought my rating back up. The beginning of the book felt so relatable and promising. Chances are you’ve ended up in a space that wasn’t very welcoming to you and everything/everyone was trying to tell you that you don’t belong. The storyline was building, building until it just fell flat for the most of the book until the end. Once again, there was life (and meaning) for everything that happened up until that point. In short, I really felt that this book could’ve been 150 pages shorter.
7015074441	This author is a master of detail. This is my second book by her, and she's gained a fan - I'll read them all.
7040600322	Pochłonęłam na jedno posiedzenie. Od tej książki nie da się oderwać. Cała paleta emocji, narracja czyta się sama, a fabuła rozpisana rewelacyjnie.To nie jest jedynie „jakiś tam thriller YA w estetyce dark academia”. To lektura, która pokazuje coś więcej; jej treść nie jest ani trochę wymuszona, na wyrost (jak to często się przy powieściach YA zdarza), jej przesłanie to ważny głos i robi krok naprzód. Jej przekaz — i jego moc — uderza z wielką siłą i nie pozwala o sobie zapomnieć…
8064650433	3,75⭐️Niesamowicie wciągająca i charyzmatyczna, jeśli ktoś potrafi pisać dark academię dla młodzieży osadzoną we współczesności, to tylko pani Àbíké-Íyímídé; zakończenie wyszło trochę płasko, bo jednak nadbudowany suspens spadł na łeb na szyję poprzez tak wprost powiedziane rozwiązanie, a nie wszystkie wątki doczekały się satysfakcjonującej konkluzji. Niemniej jednak nie można zaprzeczyć, że czas spędzony na lekturze był świetny.
6341845590	Got an arc from Libro.FMOH SHIT SHES DONE IT AGAINThis is a gripping, brutal, twisty thriller that I didn’t want to put down. Mind the content warnings but oh MAN is it good and managed to keep me guessing right up until the end.
6080705457	*Thank you to the publisher for sending me a copy of this to review!*Look, I liked this book. I think it was a worthwhile read and I’d recommend it to anyone who is interested in it. However, the execution did not live up to my expectations. The way this book markets itself, and the synopsis of the book, sounded much more enticing than the actual experience of reading it sadly. It just fell short on several aspects.Vibe wise, I loved the tense dark academic aspects a lot. I loved how, similar to what she did with Ace of Spades, how she took such an immense and heavy subject matter and really went to town on unpacking it with the direct and brutal honesty that it deserved. I think she does an incredible job of having these characters who have been through a lot, and getting them the justice they deserve - it’s incredible representation to have in a ya novel, and she touches on some really taboo and unsavoury topics we don't often talk about with young adults which is great. I think her books are really valuable in that aspect.Despite how much I can respect what she was going for, I don’t necessarily think the story was well done. To begin with, the length of the book felt very long winded. When you actually strip it down to the individual plot points, there was not enough going on for it to be dragged out over so many pages. A lot of it felt quite slow moving and dull, for a thriller-esque storyline I would’ve expected consistent snappy pacing, and more urgency to want to turn the pages. Something about the style of the writing to this one felt a little off, and I wasn’t immediately sucked in or invested. I don’t think it was helped by the fact that we’re thrown into the deep end with little backstory or context, and then supposed to care about a missing girl we don’t know at all. There’s also the dual sort of narrative unravelling slowly regarding what happened to our main character in the past, and I just don’t think there was enough pull for me to truly want to get to the bottom of either storyline.Character wise, I think there was a lot going on, and not all of the characters were as fleshed out and I would have liked. A lot of these characters fell quite flat and felt extremely two dimensional. There’s a small bit of character growth and progression visible by the end, but for a novel of this length with such vast reaching goals, I don’t think it quite met them. The friendships in here didn’t feel authentic or believable, and I can’t really put my finger on why. I don’t think the characters really had any tangible chemistry together, so it didn’t strike me as obvious why they’d be compatible as friends really. This then bled into the romantic relationships and threads that were attempted too, it all just felt a bit bland.Also I know this definitely isn’t the point of the book, but including the trope of ‘slow burn sapphic romance’ to market this and then providing what is, at best, an instalove presented at 94% with no real palpable chemistry between the characters before that point is… a choice. I have no idea if the sapphic slow burn was in the room with us, which is nuts because clocking in at almost 600 pages some of those words you wasted earlier could have been invested in some relationship building.This is definitely still an author I’ll continue to read, because her boldness in the themes she chooses to explore in her books is extremely refreshing and I like the ideas she challenges through her work. I think she’s writing extremely important and brave protagonists that I’ll continue to root for, but this one didn’t wholly land for me. An excellent idea, and I can see why this really worked for the majority of people, but I had too many things holding me back from rating this any higher.
6180271902	4.5 Stars Insightful, gripping and completely unputdownable! Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé’s Where Sleeping Girls Lie is a mystery-laden powerhouse of a novel, with a dark academia style premise that packs quite an emotional punch. Tackling themes of grief, rape culture and toxic masculinity, Àbíké-Íyímídé’s emotionally nuanced (and character driven) prose deftly explores the rather disturbing reality of institutional privilege and the trauma inflicted when those privileges—and the power connected to it, is abused. Told in third person, we follow new girl, Sade Hussein, who has no idea what to expect at the prestigious, Alfred Nobel Academy—the elite and respected boarding school she’s just enrolled at. But, one things for certain—she never expected her roommate to go missing on her first night. Or for rumours to point the blame in her direction, leading to interest from the most popular clique in school-The Unholy Trinity.Balancing new found friendship with the popular kids and a gruelling school schedule, Sade still can’t shake the wrongness to the school staff’s indifference to a missing student. So, taking things into her own hands, she teams up with missing girl Elizabeth’s bestie, Baz, to find out what really happened. However, uncovering the truth is harder than it first appears, as the halls (and it’s students) are steeped in lies and secrets …I absolutely loved this! The attention of detail was phenomenal and the intricately connected clues that propel the narrative were cleverly placed, keeping the suspense fabulously high.Though I confess, it was the multilayered and depth filled characters and the way in which they navigate their pain and trauma that captivated me the most. Particularly protagonist Sade who,though guarded at first glance, was an incredibly endearing character with a slowly unfurling backstory of loss, grief and resilience that had me rooting for her every step of her journey.I also adored the found family-esque dynamics and friendship that grows between her and pink haired cinnamon roll, Baz. His adorably chaotic nature really brought a lightheartedness to plot’s intensity and allowed us to catch a glimpse at what Sadie’s future may entail—with a network of love and support that will help heal the inner turmoil she has held onto for soo long. Persephone and her character development was fascinating for very similar reasons, and I enjoyed the slow-burn friendship-turned romance that we experience between her and Sade, as they get to know (and trust) one another.The ending wasn’t as straight forward and satisfying as I would’ve liked, but was a fairly realistic portrayal of how similar (real world) situations have been dealt with. The focus on many of the female characters and their individual paths to healing was a nice touch— underlining the importance of mental health services and support for survivors of sexual assault. Overall, a powerfully poignant, Mean Girls style murder mystery (with queer and Muslim rep) that would work brilliantly as a book club pick, or to kick start discussions around power & privilege, racial discrimination and rape culture with teen/ young adult readers. Just be sure to check the TWs beforehand.Also a massive thank you to Fritha at Usborne for the amazing proof.
6079396746	So sad about this one I loved Ace of Spades but this book was so boring and also used some bad writing (the room was small, yet big. He looked at no one, yet everyone) that I found myself dreading picking it up. The love interest didn’t make sense to me and the ending showed this was an interesting concept but poorly executed.
6670446700	“Boys with everything. The world had been and always would be theirs for the taking. Sade had learned to fear the men who had everything, because even the moon, the skies and the earth could not sate them.”

6977612747	I do appreciate some genre-bending YA. I thought about lots of different genres and media as I read this book: mean girls, the secret history, a good girl's guide to murder, beartown, rebecca, the girl with the dragon tattoo, ninth house, heart stopper, silence of the lambs, skins/euphoria, sex education, recess, the end of the fucking world (did that one get another season?), and heathers. Several things happened that I didn't see coming, and a few were not something I could have predicted if I tried. That said, there were several cons. The book relied on a suspension of disbelief and abided by YA lit rules (in other words, don't expect realism or an air tight plot). There are a few moments when lessons about social issues are occasionally spelled out in an unnatural ways, and characters will do or say things that are illogical, tropey, or inconsistent with how teenagers would act. I learned from another review that the book drags around the halfway mark, and then changed gears in the 60-65% range and suddenly A Lot Happens. I had considered DNFing this one, but am ultimately glad I didn't. The whole thing was a wild ride. Recommended if adolescent gothic dark academia sounds like a good time, especially if it's contrasted with painfully comedic teen culture. 3.25 stars.
6152371990	i had high expectations, and unfortunately i feel a bit let down.this book definitely needed editing. it felt overwritten at times, with so many words being used to describe something that would've been fine described in much less. the pacing felt off, too; we went from it being super slow to it randomly picking up after the halfway point, and then we got hit with two info dumps that could've been sprinkled throughout the book. every plot line felt like it went nowhere. the characters felt a bit... flat? even sade, who we're following the whole time.i haven't read ace of spades yet, but i've heard so many good things about it that i'll likely give it a chance and see how i like it. when i liked the writing in this book (and the vibes!), i really really liked it.
6367800163	Another great read from Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé! The writing captured my attention from the beginning and the opening chapter left me so curious about what was going on here. There was so much tension and mystery surrounding the plot and Sade herself was a very intriguing character.I appreciated how Àbíké-Íyímídé dealt with heavy subjects here like grief and sexual assault. Nothing was gratuitous and there weren't any scenes to shock the reader into feeling something. That made this an even more emotional read for me. How those particular elements were tackled and developed showed just how good of a writer Àbíké-Íyímídé is.A few plot points and foreshadowing were a bit obvious and predictable, however. I wouldn't say me figuring out what was happening took much away from the story, but I would have liked to be surprised... This was still a great read, and I will definitely pick up whatever else Àbíké-Íyímídé publishes.
6557817121	4,5 ⭐️Thrillers YA são definitivamente a minha perdição.Adorei este livro. Achei a premissa bastante interessante. Todo o ambiente na academia, os segredos e revelações e reviravoltas deixaram-me super envolvida na história. Li-o numa leitura conjunta com a Bia e a Carol e criámos imensas teorias. Foi super divertido.Contudo, sinto que o desenlace não fez jus ao "build-up" das personagens e do enredo. Algumas coisas ficaram por explicar, a meu ver.Apesar de tudo isto, não posso deixar de recomendar este livro. (Senti que ia ser 5 estrelas durante grande parte da minha experiência de leitura.) Quem gostou do livro 'Ás de Espadas' da mesma autora, ou é fã da Holly Jackson, vai certamente apreciar este.
