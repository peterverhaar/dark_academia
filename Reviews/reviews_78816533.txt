5393213516	Lesbian gothic horror in October... as a treat <3I put it off until February... as a treat <3Fun, quick read. This time I had a harder time caring about the characters compared to other books by the author, so it gets a 4/5
5282228494	I received an ARC from Edelweiss TW: hospitalization, accidental misgendering, mentions of addiction, mentioned attempted abortion, child abandonment4.2Waters doesn’t miss in terms of atmosphere, writing, and queer girls- and she certainly didn’t this time! This may be her first stab at dark academia, but you wouldn’t be able to tell, it’s beautifully done. It falls within the realm of the genre while bringing something new to the vibe.I really loved Tara- a lower class student fed scraps and desperately wanting to prove that she’s worth more, but also being the only person who’s resilient enough to tear everything down instead of letting it use her. The parental/family part of this really added a whole new layer as well, to give you the understanding of exactly where Tara’s coming from and what she has on the line.The romance isn’t a main focus on the book, but it is incredibly cute, and adds a little softness. It could have worked even without romantic love, but it also helped along the great found family vibe of the Freshman class of Magni Viri.Honestly, I really loved the side characters in this. I love the whole secret society adjacent fraternity, but the individuals really gave it the feel of a true friend group and actual people with their lives on the line. Honestly, I would have loved to have more of them- especially Quigg. It would’ve been great to have more contact with the older members, too, which would’ve made it feel more like a full society instead of a handful of teenagers.The only real issue I had with this book was that a lot of the details I wanted were skimmed past. Beyond having the society feel more expansive and have more detail, there were moments like the divorce that felt like they were going somewhere, and the other ghosts existences that I just was expecting more of. I’d also have really loved actually getting to know Tara’s writing style.Pre-review comments belowErica Waters called this a queer, dark academia ghost story YES YES YES YES YES YES YESSSS Update I got an aaaarc 😍
5772582517	And, just like that, one of my most anticipated Fall reads became a major disappointment.This book was pitched as gothic, ghostly, and queer, where a girl joins a secretive academic society after one of its members suddenly passes away. Liberated from a life of repaying student loans and two jobs, Tara finds herself free to pursue a career as an author with the full backing of Magni Viri. However, she quickly learns that her induction into this society may not be all she imagined.At first, ALL THAT CONSUMES US was haunting and atmospheric, but, as the mystery unraveled, I found myself increasingly annoyed. The cause of Tara's horror only made sense on a surface level because the more I pondered it, the more glaringly obvious plot holes/character logic became. And not in a gothic, deteriorating-sanity type of way (though I'm sure that was partly the author's intent), but simply a lack of deeper thinking on the author's behalf about plot implications.A lot of this novel focuses on building suspense and dread, which was fairly believable until the big reveal, a little over halfway through. After the big reveal occurs, I had a lot of questions about Magni Viri, but 90% of them went unanswered (perhaps after publication day I will post a full, no-spoilers-barred review that explains this). Just about the only thing I liked about this book was the author's inclusion of a wide array of representations and diversity. There are characters who are disabled, characters who are nonbinary, and, to my utter delight, a featured relationship between two female characters that weren't fetishized. That being said, I felt as though this book was lacking insight into the finer details of these supporting characters, both in terms of personality and interactions with the main character. I could have had less of Tara and more of everyone else.All in all, this book started off strong but quickly delved into frustrating. While I was fastidiously consuming the first half of this book, I struggled to get through the last quarter of the book. If this book sounds like it would suit you for Fall, I would caution you going in that the plot is disappointing.➫ 2.5 Stars
5845863248	The moment I started this book I was sucked into the academic atmosphere, and as the plot and relationships progressed I was HOOKED. This is the absolute perfect combo of plot/horror and the dark academia ~vibes~ - I find a lot of books only do one of those things successfully.Great queer rep! I would say this was pretty light horror, but a few scenes definitely would have terrified me if I was alone in the dark.
5852369484	Absolutely hated every minute of this book. It was written by/for a babyqueer who spent too much time on Tumblr. There are ways to write queer characters so that they don't feel so forced?? It felt like pandering and sooooo annoying. The narration and actions of characters was in direct conflict for the whole thing too. The other characters and narration kept saying how Tara was so smart and such a good writer but then all she writes is a shitty Jane Eyre fanfiction, and then can't even manage to write anything herself after her financial situation changed. Tara directly compares herself to Meredith saying she was just as good, if not better, but she was just a whiny annoying brat the whole book.
5493197367	This dark academic tale has stupored my brain. A book about a girl who wants to be a writer lured into the elite society of college 'Magni Viri'. And while everything lustres here like gold, the students look all insane. All that consumes us has literally consumed me while I consumed it. This devious cycle goes on throughout the book.Loaded with ghostly spirits, Latin spells, and madness to excel at their courses, the story is a maddening tale of students in pursuit of passion. It captures the reader's attention like nothing else. It's scary and captivating, and the world buildup is so real and freaking great. You can't separate reality, imagination, hallucination, or possession 👻A perfect companion for your Halloween week!Thank you @this_is_edelweiss @ericawatersbooks and @harpercollins for this wonderful ARC. This was a wonderful bookGenre: #gothic #fantasy #horror #ya #lgbtRating: 5/5 ⭐️ Tropes: #darkacademia #foundfamily
5450353125	Dark academia, ghosts, graveyards, obsession, possession, paranoia. This book has it all! Tara feels like she doesn’t fit in at Corbin College. When she is offered a chance to enroll in Magni Viri, an elite academic society with free tuition, she accepts with no hesitation. Tara, who takes the place of the most recent dead girl Meredith, thinks that she is possessing her and using her body to write her novella during the night. But actually, what is happening is much worse. This book is perfect for spooky season. 4.5 stars rounded up. Thanks to Erica Waters, Harper Teen, and NetGalley for the ARC.
5626261943	see, the thing is, if you have the gall to compare your book to the secret history then it better have tartt level writing, themes, storytelling capabilities, and characterization.newsflash: 100% of the books that are marketed this way have NONE of the above
5848025450	Deeply atmospheric, this Southern Gothic ghost story will give you chills.First-generation college student Tara Boone has sacrificed everything to get to Corbin College, but she still feels like she's struggling to keep her head above water. All she wants is to be able to write. After a tragedy opens up a spot in the elite secret society Magni Viri, Tara finally feels like she has a chance: free tuition, academic mentoring, guaranteed success after graduation, and a close knit group of peers who are also driven to achieve greatness. But of course, nothing comes without a cost. But the farther she descends into Magni Viri, the more she suspects that the price is even higher and darker than she could have imagined...I think this is a phenomenal example of YA dark academia. The setting here really is its own character - old Tennessee school, intimidatingly old and dark buildings, and graveyards. There's a steady feeling of paranoia buzzing in the background as Tara struggles to discover the truth and survive.One of the aspects that elevates this ghost story is the care that Waters takes in developing interesting, well-rounded, and diverse characters. Several of the characters, including Tara, are explicitly queer. Although this is definitely not a romance overall, I enjoyed the sapphic relationship between Tara and her love interest. There is a side character who is non-binary, and the conversation around pronouns is simple but well done, as well as a side character with an autoimmune disease who uses a mobility aid. Classism is also discussed and important throughout the story - Tara struggles with feeling like she belongs at an elite institution and importantly doesn't have a safety net to fall back on.If you're looking for something spooky to kick off this fall reading season that will give you chills but not nightmares, All That Consumes Us is a great pick for you! In general, I'd recommend Erica Waters' books to anyone who's interested in sapphic Southern gothic ghost stories (a subgenre you perhaps didn't realize you needed in your life, but you do). Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for the eARC in exchange for my honest opinion.
5658191100	This is THE dark academia, secret society, haunting, gothic, lit-inspired book of the year. Criminally under hyped.
5956749824	Really enjoyed this one. Will definitely add it to the Dark Academia Instagram post I'm working on.Now, this is the type of Dark Academia that I love. A lot of the ones I have been reading lately were either too full of drama or didn't have enough of the DA atmosphere. I like my DA with a side of supernatural or murder/mystery, and this has BOTH. It also mixed in queer characters and found family. This was just -chefs kiss- a lovely dark little story.
5951645974	PERFECT Oct. read!
5296329788	3 / 5 🌟“if i didn’t know any better, i’d say you’re worried about me,” i say. “oh, go fuck yourself,” neil says, but this time, there’s something like fondness in his voice.”—this book was good. some things were great and some things were just okay. i didn’t like the characters as much as i was hoping, but the plot itself made up for it to a certain extent. if you’re into “secret” sororities and ghosts, this might be up your alley, but if you’re going in expecting it to be filled with character development or developed friendships, you may be disappointed!
5688215979	Thank you to NetGalley and HarperTeen for access to an eARC in exchange for an honest review!!The moment I saw this book was a queer ghost story, I was already sold. But the fact that it's also got immaculate gothic horror vibes that only get stronger and spookier the further into the book you read, the found family trope, a dangerous and secretive academic society, and *screams* dark academia dragged me so far into it that I put everything else I was reading on hold for the most part to fly through this one. And I was *not* disappointed.Tara Boone, having spent most of her life in a backwards town taking care of her mother rather than the other way around, seizes the opportunity to leave her directionless life behind when she's accepted to Corbin College, her eyes set on the full scholarship and promised family-like relations of Magni Viri, the extremely exclusive academic society on campus. But when she isn't accepted into Magni Viri and life at college turns out to be far more difficult than she'd anticipated with no friends or social life to speak of, she finds herself dragging her feet through each day just trying to get by while taking classes, working two campus jobs, and trying in her minimal free time to work on her writing.But everything changes one night after what she labels a failed reading of one of her short stories, and in the coming days, she finds herself invited to join a suddenly vacant spot in Magni Viri and being ushered into the life she'd wished for so desperately. Suddenly, she has time to work on her writing, she's meeting a host of new friends, and she feels connected with the other Magni Viri students and the society itself, like she's a part of something bigger. Too bad even the good feelings from all of that can't keep her afloat once the nightmares and apparent sleepwalking start, making her feel as though she's getting little to no rest for days at a time. And when it seems like everyone around her understands what's happening to her but won't fill her in or help her, it's up to Tara to solve the mystery and save herself from whatever is slowly consuming her.This book is without a doubt one of my favorite reads of the year so far. A study in modern gothic horror, the atmosphere was cold and dreary and just the right amount of spooky and haunting even in the lighter moments. Erica Waters has a way of weaving words together that dragged me right into the story alongside Tara and all of her friends, the story kept me guessing almost until the very end on exactly what was going to happen, and the characters were diverse and well rounded and flawed and felt *so real* that I wanted to be friends with them myself. I would also sell my soul for a chance to read the novel being written throughout the book, Cicada, just for the experience of reading those words as well.But I think what ended up personally drawing me into All That Consumes Us most of all was how much I found myself relating to Tara. A young girl who dreams of being a novelist (with a love of Jane Eyre and other gothic literature) from a small town spending her life taking care of everyone but herself, wishing for something more for her future and distancing herself from her past to get to where she needs to be, struggling constantly with finding a community and with feeling like an imposter in her own skin...it was the first time in a long while that I've connected so deeply with the protagonist of a novel that I could so fully understand the decisions they made.
5789950120	La estética Dark Academia funciona muy bien en esta historia.Me gustaron el misterio y el plot twist. La primer mitad de la historia es interesante y atrapante, pero hacia el final sentí que se desinflaba un poco.Una vez que la protagonista descubre el misterio, la historia comienza a dar vueltas sobre si misma inutilmente sin avanzar, y luego cuando los personajes deciden tomar acción en la solución del problema, no hay ningún contratiempo, todo les sale bien.Sé que para algunas personas la temática de "found family" va a ser un atractivo del libro, pero sentí que hacia el final ya era muy trazo grueso, no había sutilezas sino que la autora nos tiraba en la cara todo el tiempo el tema. (view spoiler)[Sentí que era demasiado, sobre todo porque los personajes se conocían hacia menos de 6 meses y hasta hace unos capítulos atrás la protagonista pensaba que la estaban traicionando. (hide spoiler)]En general lo disfruté, pero me dio la sensación de que estaba apuntado a un público mas joven, mas adolescente que universitario.
5591174271	Overall this book was fun read with lots of twists and turns. It is short and sweet with strikingly beautiful descriptions. The writing style is the perfect blend of modern language and Shakespearean metaphors. The complex romance echoed the real confusion of human emotions and betrayal. On the other hand the main character Tara at times felt a bit “I’m not like other girls” especially at the beginning in relation to her roommate Helena. However the sentiment does make sense because of how ostracized she is by her classmates. Towards the middle of the book Tara changes her mind quite literally every 2 pages. However I would still recommend this book to people who like gothic and spooky vibes. (It also gave me some good gothic literature recommendations)
6042082749	Super cheesy and even at 17, I refuse to believe this girl is this stupid. Not the worst book I've read by any means, but not good either.
5297969431	Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for this audio arc!All That Consumes Us is a story that follows Tara, a girl in college who is the age of a teenager (16/17), who is trying to make her own way in the world. Tara wants to build a life for herself and find closeness with friends since her home life was lacking in many ways and is responsible for Tara growing up faster than a typical kid would. She is excited when a prestigious program in her school reaches out to offer her membership after initially rejecting her but the excitement wanes when she realizes she was offered the position because another student died. Tara expects to make friends, learn a lot, and dive into writing in a way she never has before. But her expectations are quickly stifled when the reality of this society's secrets begin to overtake her life.I enjoyed much of this story. Erica Waters writing is stunning as always. I will read everything they write because it is beautifully immersive and believable storytelling with relatable characters.This is a three star read because the pacing felt a little strange. There were times I found myself thinking the story was winding down or coming to the big climax only for there to be something else come up. I get that authors do this sometimes as a way to trick readers and shock them with the truth, but nothing in this really felt like a big shock or reveal after the initial one. So the second half of the book felt like it dragged to get to the conclusion.My second issue is the ages of the characters. It is a weird choice to write a book set in college but the main characters are somehow still teenagers. Like high school age teenagers. I don't really understand what purpose this served in the overall story other than this book needed to be marketed to a YA audience. And I do feel like it was a strange juxtaposition to just randomly bring up how their not adults for no consequential reason. This could have been a book about college freshman and it would have been the same. Or it could have been a book about high school seniors set in a prestigious high school societal club and it would have been the same. Just seems like a weird choice. The last issue I have is with the audiobook production. Sound quality was great. The narrator not as much. She wasn't bad, but she did often forget to look ahead to see which characters were speaking and used the wrong accent for a character. This was particularly problematic for me when she would give the non-binary character a female voice when the narrator had previously given them a more neutral voice. Also, the narrator was not great at any deeper male voices.Overall, I would recommend. But it wouldn't be the first Erica Waters book I recommend to people.
6183849717	Gotikinė, vaiduokliška, keista tamsi akademinė knyga apie koledžo studentus. Pridėkite slaptą toksišką akademinę draugiją “Magni Viri” su paslaptimi.Istorija sukasi apie Tarą, kuri ką tik buvo pakviesta prisijungti prie akademijos “elito” ir naudotis visomis privilegijomis. Dabar ji gali sutelkti dėmesį į savo knygos rašymą. Tačiau kiekvieną kartą jai pradėjus rašyti, kažkas keistai blogo įvyksta. Lyg ir ji rašo, lyg ir ne ji. Kažkas čia ne taip. Kuo toliau ji leidžiasi į Magni Viri, tuo labiau ji įtaria, kad kaina dar didesnė ir tamsesnė, nei ji galėjo įsivaizduoti...Ir kai atrodo, kad visi aplinkiniai supranta, kas su ja darosi, bet niekas nenori jai padėti, Tara turi įminti paslaptį ir išgelbėti save nuo to, kas ją lėtai ryja.Knygos atmosfera buvo šalta ir niūri, o net ir akimirkomis, kai rodos pavyko atsikvėpti, ji buvo bauginanti ir persekiojanti. Man labai patiko, kaip autorė puikiai vedžiojo per Viktorijos laikų pastatų koridorius, taip suteikdama būtent tą nuotaiką, kuri net rodos skverbiasi iš tų akmenų. . Nors neslėpkim vaiduokliai irgi prie to prisidėjo. O gal ne jie?Nors meilės linija čia nublanksta. Labai smagu buvo stebėti Taros pasirinkimus, ir kaip draugystė išsirutuliojo į pirmus bučinius. O minėjau, kad tai LGBTQ linija. Nice. Tai gotikinė YA istorija, kurią tikrai rekomenduoju visiems, kas yra susipažinę arba nori susipažinti su dark academia.
8027258206	Dark academia standalone that I found to be enjoyable and haunting (pun intended).
5852454368	A very good read. Just what I expected from the blurb. The story was interesting and original. The writing was too simple at times, I think due to first person point of view. I want to read more by this author.
6341686117	It’s like Ninth House meets If We Were Villains, which are two of my favorite books, so it’s impossible not to love it!
7876532172	excellent dark academia with secret society, haunted house (kind of? but not really?), ghosts, and girls falling in love with each other!!! yes!! fun!I loved it, great for fall & a little spooky too (still a pretty light horror elements so don’t worry)
5562334321	LGBTQ dark academia, mystery/thriller. This was described as being for fans of Ninth House. Unfortunately it isn't, and wasn't for me. Maybe my expectations were too high.I will say the "thriller" aspect of this book was fine. But only fine. However, I was mostly bored, and found myself not wanting to finish. The characters were dull and annoying. The writing was pretty juvenile, and while this is YA I don't think the level of writing proficiency has to be. I've read a lot of mediocre YA that was much better than this.Thank you to the HarperCollins for a digital copy of this ARC in exchange for an honest review.
6620329917	This was a beautiful book. The writing flowed nicely and felt very Old Gothic, and the characters were enjoyable. I wish we'd gotten a bit more of the side characters, but that's just because they all seemed so interesting, and I loved how diversity was handled in this. It felt so natural and realistic. The first half of the book, when it toes the line between mundane and magical, was by far my favourite bit, and the build-up of the mystery was so intriguing, with a fairly good payoff.
5738787399	I have been in a little slump but I loved this so much it knocked me right out of it. Amazing gothic atmosphere, a fun cast, spooky happenings (I wouldn't call this horror, but a lot of creepy moments), and amazing gay longing. I really liked the main character, she's insecure but wants to be great - the expression of conflicting emotions is really well done. I liked how the mystery unraveled itself, some of it a bit obvious but its still for teens and entertaining enough that I enjoyed it a ton
6212836734	3.75⭐️I still don't get who in the world was calling her😅
5449386551	All That Consumes Us is a gothic, dark academia novel with nightmares, secret societies, and malevolent spirits!I always love gothic novels AND dark academia novels, so this book was right up my alley! The atmosphere was intriguing, the mysterious aspects of the book kept me guessing (though I am happy to say I figured it out!), and I absolutely loved the academic discussions that took place in the novel!But I did have some complaints as well. For one, it was too long. It could’ve been 50-100 pages shorter. I don’t think that there were a lot of unnecessary scenes, but I do think that the author is too descriptive. A lot of scenes could’ve been shorter. Being over-descriptive made the book drag at times. Another complaint of mine is that the main character kept saying certain things like they were a revelation, but they were quite obvious to the reader. I found myself saying “duhh” to her a lot😬 And my last complaint is that I wish that the main character’s dark thoughts had been explored beyond a certain point. In the beginning of the book, there was a lot of emphasis placed on dark and jealous thoughts had by the main character, but the dark depths of her personality weren’t explored as much as I think they could’ve been. But overall, I did enjoy this book and it is a great read for anyone who, like me, loves dark academia and gothic vibes!I received a free e-copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you HarperTeen and NetGalley for this arc. All opinions are my own.Trigger Warning: parental abandonment
6594273138	2,5/5 ✰all that consumes us was surprisingly not my cup of tea. i’m a huge dark academia fan and thought i would love it but i ended up not being much a fan of the whole plot. the main character irritated me quite quickly with her obsession with meredith and, well, there’s nothing much to say other than this book wasn’t for meapart from my personal opinion on the story, the writing is quite good so i’d still encourage anyone with even a tiny bit of interest to read it “maybe at some point you just have to be proud of yourself and let that be enough”
5853215478	Okay wow. I absolutely loved this one, I’m going to have to read it again and annotate because there’s some seriously beautiful writing in this I don’t want to forget! I love that it’s everything I want in a dark academia but with less pretentiousness. Setting it in the Appalachians was unexpected but it added so much richness to the story. I’m also glad it was a college and not a high school because the characters get to do so much more on their own terms. It was spooky but beautiful. Completely haunting and hard to put down. I especially loved the Cicada novella snippets and I would love to read Cicada or even a full spinoff story about its author. Definitely check this one out!
6910871683	For the first half or so, I was afraid the story would be a little too simplistic for me, but the second half really made up for it. This ended up being a really accessible YA dark academia, that I think will be great if you're new to the genre, but will still be interesting enough for people who've read a lot of dark academia.
5915828225	☆ 3.5 ☆At first, I really didn't like this book. It mentioned things like Instagram, Twitter (which is already outdated), and things like boomers?? The descriptions of characters Tara would meet was too forced. She described them as they appeared, and it wasn't how people would think?? So, the narrative was part of the problem. But, that being said, I actually ended up really enjoying it. Once the plot took its turn and more was revealed, I actually really liked reading it and couldn't put it down. Do I think it's amazing? No. Would I recommend it? I mean...maybe? I think this book is great for people who don't read too often but want an interesting, and kind of scary, book to read. After reading up on the author and seeing she has won awards for some of her other work, I am very interested in what else she has written. Maybe I'll check it out!
6851245677	** spoiler alert ** porządne polskie dziady by ich uratowały, where is guślarz when you need him
5512248903	Tara enrolled in Corbin College to finally do something for herself. Even if it means she must work as a janitorial assistant to make it work. As a writer, her first choice for tuition coverage would have been as a selected member of the exclusive Magni Viri. A highly secretive society where all students room and board are paid for, and they have a connection to each other. A society who's membership practically guarantees a successful career. A society full of geniuses and people who change the world. Then a student dies, and Tara is offered membership. As she learns more about the organization and its members, she begins to feel a force surrounding her, she begins waking up at her desk with pages full of writing but no memory of even sitting down. As she starts to unravel the truth, her fellow members grow more secretive, and her own control of her mind begins to waver, I will admit that I was totally hooked from the beginning. Every time I had to put the book down, I couldn't wait to pick it back up. Waters certainly created an engrossing narrative and world. I loved the secret society, the history there, the mechanisms of how it worked. This was very much a mature theme and content for a YA book. And I think that's where its downfall lies. From the get-go, the fact that Tara is working as a janitor of all things, when multiple on campus jobs exist was something I'd expect to see in a Disney movie. It was such a juvenile attempt at showing a separation of class, not to mention to show how desperate Tara was to attend school. It felt more like something out of a wattpad novel then a dark academia. Then Tara's best friend from school, who is currently very obsessed with her boyfriend over talking to Tara, is constantly shown to blow Tara off despite none of Tara's comments about her giving the impression she was a jerk. Tara had pushed the friend away when they were still in the same town, then Tara needs someone on her side, and makes one singular attempt to talk to the friend. Tara attempts to call friend when she finds the dead body. Friend replies that she's with her boyfriend, sorry. Instead of then saying "I just found a body" Tara laments at being so alone. Like, I'm supposed to feel sorry for her? This is after Tara attempts to contact the friend about her mother not answering calls, her mother who is acknowledged as a terrible person who's done this kind of thing before. And understandably, the friend is not concerned about the mother's disappearance. Again, this is portrayed as them not being a good friend, and that Tara is all alone, but I just see this as a very immature vision of friendship. That's to say nothing of the repetitiveness. Multiple times, Tara learns a piece of information, then decides she will fight back, then has a set back, and immediately allows her life to be taken over by the ghost because she doesn't see any point in fighting. This literally happens twice. It's such a major character shift then she just falls back into it. I can understand it possibly being a representation of depression, and the cycle of that, except it is repetitive and tiresome. Tara will make a large stance about taking.back control of her life, fail at a barely thought out plan, and basically shrug her shoulders and say "welp, no use fighting or being aware of my life I guess." Once would be appropriate. This happens blatantly at least twice and to a lesser extent three times. Then there's the writing itself. I can't tell you how many times something will be mentioned or referred to in a way that implies I've read that piece of information, that it's something I as the reader were already aware of. Except it wasn't. References to family members, or medical treatment, or a whole host of things are referenced in that specific way that implies I should recall a conversation from earlier in the book. But that conversation never happened, there was nothing to go back to. Waters just constantly forgot she didn't write those scenes or cut the scenes and never changed references to them. I was left feeling like I missed a page countless times. It's not an enjoyable experience as a reader.Overall, the writing style does negate a lot of the issues with the book. But if repetitiveness, juvenile writing around mature themes and characters, and missing context that is implied you should know are something that bothers you as a reader, I would skip this one. The dark academia, spooky elements are very fun, and made me give this the extra half star (for 3.5 total), but its weaknesses, which I hope are only because I read an early copy of the book, are very prevalent.
7171690775	** spoiler alert ** 3.75*** I think that I could spend my whole life reading dark academia and contentedly never want another genre so I may be a bit biased. Ghost possessions, secrets and foggy forest campus yes yes yes it’s like it was written for me. As always the imagery of a beautiful institution rotted from the inside out is something I EAT UP but I felt like it was a bit spelled out for the reader as if the author had little faith in the reader to connect the dots and understand the metaphor
6057225795	Okay so I really liked this book. The queer representation through the main character and her girlfriend didn’t feel forced at all. The beginning and ending of the story were super interesting to read. However the middle dragged on for SO LONG. I was pretty bored in the middle and had to set the book down for a while. Overall I loved this story.
5639267116	4.5/5 starsRecommended if you like: ghosts, dark academia, light horror, college settings, mystery, LGBTQ+ charactersBig thanks to Netgalley, HarperTeen, and the author for an ARC in exchange for an honest review!This book actually surprised me with the opening, which was different than what I'd expected. That being said, a lot of the other plot points in the book were very predictable and it wasn't hard to figure out what was going to happen/going on as soon as the first threads were laid. I was actually kind of surprised Tara didn't put it together immediately.That being said, Waters does a good job with atmospheric writing and that really came through here. Before we're even inducted into Magni Viri, the world of Corbin College is set with fog and prestige and tradition. Magni Viri adds an additional layer to this, and the Victorian mansion is both elegant and creepy. The natural surroundings come into play somewhat too, with cicadas, bats, forest, and fog all playing at least somewhat of a role in creating the mood and setting. I'm personally a fan of eco-horror and Southern Gothic, so I would've liked a bit more of nature/setting as a character, but the genre of this book is dark academia, so what's here fits the bill.Magni Viri is, as mentioned, steeped in secrecy and tradition. Only people who have been inducted have set foot inside the dormitory and there are whispers around Corbin College that students in Magni Viri perform dark rituals. There's a good balance in Magni Viri of the academically/artistically intense and the supernaturally strange. The students are talented and are dedicated to their fields of study, sometimes to an unhealthy level, which contributes to the vibes of the story.Our main character Tara has the fortune of being inducted into Magni Viri with a concentration in writing. Her dream is to become a writer and so being able to join should be everything she wants, but imposter syndrome and strange goings-on plague her as the semester progresses. It kind of bothered me how insecure Tara was. She applied to a prestigious academic group and wanted it with everything she had....but then she constantly doubts her own worth and questions her place. Like, you either think you're good enough for prestige or you don't, you can't waffle in the middle. Luckily, this is also kind of the advice Tara gets from other people, though she isn't too good at following (or trying to follow) it. Tara seems at least a little more confident by the end of the book, which is good, but it would've been nice to see it a bit earlier.There's a bit of an ensemble cast, but the main people are Penny, Tara's kind-of girlfriend, and Wren, Tara's roommate. Jordan, Neil, and Azar are other members of the freshman Magni Viri class, and senior Quigg comes up a few times we well. Most everyone is immediately inviting to Tara, though Neil is a bit standoffish at first. Wren is a music major in Magni Viri and is a good roommate/friend, but clearly has something else going on. Wren is one of the catalysts for things getting started plot-wise.Penny is in Magni Viri studying bats and she and Tara are almost immediately close. Penny helps Tara to understand that she isn't the only one in their prestigious program to have a disadvantaged background and she acts as somewhat of a stabilizing influence on Tara while also helping to increase her self-confidence.I will say, as annoying as it was, Tara was justified in being angry at people for hiding things from her. Obviously it was a bad situation all around, but I still kind of think they should've tried harder to tell her what was going on.One of the downsides of this book is that all the characters are just sort of there. They each have their own personalities and quirks and what not, but I didn't really feel like we got much past the surface level for any of them. Having read the entire book, I don't really have a ton to say about anyone, which is kind of disappointing for a book with an ensemble cast who all end up caught up in the plot.
6025555409	”Well, it’s your life, ain’t it? You fight for it.”The first third and last third of this book had me hooked. The build up and climax were impeccable. I got bored in the middle but I’m happy I pushed through. The love and friendship Tara finds along her journey warmed my heart. Mr. Hanks is my everything. That is all.
5750522433	the first half of this book kept going around in circles, and it took forever for things to start picking up. overall this book was disappointing and even annoying sometimes. the ending also felt really rushed
5913085479	Gothic dark academia heck yeah!Dark academia, to me, are those books set in a collegiate atmosphere (they don’t even have to necessarily be set in a college, but the atmosphere needs to be collegiate in nature) where the plot of the book is centered around the darker and more predatory aspects of academia: publish or perish, predatory lending practices, racism, secret societies, homophobia, corrupt officials, and so on. All That Consumes Us is gothic in nature due to the isolated setting of not only the liberal arts college it takes place in (fictional Corbin College), but also because the secret society at the heart of the plot, Magni Viri, lives in an isolated Victorian dorm building on the oldest and most isolated reaches of the campus. The students of Magni Viri really are set above and apart from the rest in more ways than one. As for the dark academia aspect of the book, the dark and predatory side of college here is in how each student of Magna Viri is recruited: They all have dreams, skill, and ambition, but they need a little more push to get them to the top. Magna Viri dangles a carrot in their faces and usually warns them that there will be a stick. They just don’t know how hard that stick will whack them until it’s too late. By then, they’re stuck. The director of Magna Viri dangled the carrot in front of Tara, our protagonist, but never bothered to tell her about the stick. Telling you anything more than that would make this review spoileriffic. This is an enjoyable book, and a great fall read. I loved the creepy, New England vibe to the book. Did it feel like a college book? Not really. Did it feel like Waters was trying to drive the dark academia vibe down my throat? Yes. Did I need The Secret History mentioned so many times in one book? No. Did I enjoy the plot itself? Yes. I’m going to go ahead and recommend it because it was fun and I liked the way the plot was approached, even though I felt it was a little immature in its approach. It’s also well-trodden territory. But it was a tasty treat anyway. I was provided a copy of this title by NetGalley and the author. All thoughts, opinions, views, and ideas expressed herein are mine and mine alone.

5853257248	DNF @ 63%One of the most annoying main characters I’ve read from all year.Right off the bat, it was hard to ignore the Bunny (by Mona Awad) similarities. Poor loner English major at a wealthy private university wants to be part of this exclusive society/ group of students who are somehow more artistically talented than the rest. Are they a cult? Is it dark magic that allows them to be so talented? Finish reading to find out! Not to mention how similar the main characters dialogue and inner turmoils are. I don’t say that to say this is a copy or was even inspired by Bunny. I say it because when you’re publishing a book that is similar to another incredibly popular (150,000 goodreads reviews) book that came out 4 years ago, you’d think you’d want to set yourself apart, change some details without changing the crux of the story. But instead it’s difficult not to draw comparisons between the two. They honestly could be set at the same university, same classes (especially the read-aloud lit critique scene). The main reason I’m DNFing though is because of the main character. Being in her head is insufferable. I actually turned off the audiobook and walked in silence the rest of the way home because I could not stand another minute of listening to her whine. I get it. She’s had a rough life. But I’ve read books with characters who had a much tougher go of things and they are not as whiny for as long as she is. I am not exaggerating when I say that 2/3rds of the way through the book, she has done nothing but whine and woe-is-me for 95% of that time. If she’s happy for even five minutes she brings the mood back down and finds something to complain about. Girl seriously needs therapy and Lexapro.I do like to typically end things on a positive note, so here it goes: I liked the casual queer rep. There’s a bisexual main character, lesbian love interest, and agender peripheral character. And the scary/ haunted elements were well done, they definitely spooked me.
5955391775	This was a stunning gothic story. The writing was eerie and filled with tension, clear and effortless. I loved the mystery surrounding the secret society and its members, and how that led to mistrust and paranoia for the main character, who was intentionally kept out of the loop throughout the book. There were a lot of underlying themes of loneliness, love, and belonging that manifested in different ways through many of the characters - living and dead alike. I liked how Isabella and Tara had so much in common, even though they couldn't be more different in how they handled their circumstances. Isabella made a strong antagonist and was very clearly defined as a character - much more than the director of Magni Viri, who felt more like a caricature. I liked that the book was inclusive in the way it had various queer characters, but I also can't help but feel that it was a bit obvious, and at the same time, underutilized. While I love that they were included, it felt forced to have five queer characters in the same small group of Magni Viri members, and other than an offhand remark about one of the characters being disowned by their parents, there was no real conflict or underlying message to go along with it… which would be fine if there was one queer character, but it felt so intentional to have so many in the small cast that I was surprised that there wasn't more of theme of acceptance to accompany it. That aside, I truly enjoyed the book. It may be one of my favorite gothic stories I've read over the past few years, and the plot felt fresh, and not like a rework of the same haunting story I'm used to seeing in gothic stories. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre.
5928280383	Tara is a student at Corbin College and works two jobs trying to pay for what her partial scholarship didn’t. She wanted desperately to get into Manny Hall for the free tuition but tied with someone else who they picked she feels isolated going to school with all these rich kids including her roommate who isn’t that nice to her. She finds people she does talk to about the kids from Manny Hall act a little cultish and only hang out with each other. Despite that however she would still give anything to be a resident in soon she will get her chance because ,Meredith the girl that won the tie is found dead in the library by Tara and her professor. So after Tara attends Meredith‘s funeral she is shocked when the director of Manny Hall invites her to take the dead girls place. Tera it’s shocked but definitely wants to do it even though she’s heard from her boss and others cryptic warnings about Manny Hall. After moving in tell her it’s happy she doesn’t have to pay tuition and she now has people to talk to it isn’t long before strange things start happening and eventually she feels like she may be going crazy. It seems like their are those who previously lived at Manny Hall and don’t want to leave. She feels she is being haunted by Meredith but that will just be the tip of the iceberg. I love books that have a good forest scene in it and All That Consumes Us definitely does it is almost a second character I think Erica Waters story in this a story I highly recommend if you love possessions in hauntings you’ll definitely love the story I want to thank random House publishers and net galley Thor my free arc copy please forgive any mistakes as I am blind and dictate my review did a great phenomenal job riding this spooky collegiate haunted
5496321981	I received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. Thank you kindly to HarperTeen for my review copy.I think this is perhaps the weakest novel by Erica Waters that I have read and it's left me feeling a little dejected. It is by no means a bad book but unfortunately, it fell a little flat for me. I felt it didn't quite pick up until about 30 percent of the way through, and before that, I think it felt a little stilted. One thing I will say though, it was very atmospheric -- eerie and haunting, and I felt Tara's loneliness and confusion so desperately. Unfortunately, I feel like it tapered off a bit at the end there too, but I've not let it impact my rating too much because I felt it had a really strong middle. I enjoyed Tara as a protagonist, and I enjoyed her romance with Penny, too. I felt that perhaps the group dynamics were not as strong as I had hoped which left me feeling a little emotionally disconnected from the group. Overall, ALL THAT CONSUMES US is a good Southern Gothic horror, which is where Erica Waters excels at. It has an f/f romance, a bisexual protagonist, and a disabled LI. It just fell a little flat for me which is disappointing because I enjoyed both The River Has Teeth and Ghost Wood Song.
5462008980	trigger warning(view spoiler)[ abandonment, being possessed, mention of cancer, self harm, suicidal ideation, transphobia (hide spoiler)]When a classmate dies and Tara is offered a coveted spot at Magna Viri, which will mean no more money trouble ever, she can hardly believe that her problems are over. And they aren't. The worst is yet to come.True to the genre, the story starts with "ooh, this sounds too good to be true" and then goes to finding corpses in the basement.Our protagonist is bisexual, her new roommate is non binary. One person in the tight-knit friendgroup is disabled and has an autoimmune disease and goes through flare-ups in the plot, but we're not told which disease we're talking about. I like the rep.This book sucked me right in and I read it more or less in one sitting, if we're ignoring short breaks to grab some food. At times it was predictable, but more in the building of dread and tension kind of way, which I enjoyed.Also, it seems to be a standalone, which is always a plus since that feels such a rare thing in fantasy nowadays.This was my first novel by the author, and I am excited to read more if the others get me invested like this one did - and that despite me often feeling that I am falling out of love with ya in general, lately.Would recommend for people who are both into dark academia and ghost stories.The arc was provided by the publisher.
6007383080	** spoiler alert ** This book had so much potential but squandered it all after the big reveal. The first half is perfect, likeable mysterious characters (Neil is a bit of an asshole, but he lost the love of his life, so he gets a pass from me) a creepy atmosphere and plot, a cute wlw relationship, diverse characters. It was exactly what I was looking for. But then...everything went downhill so fast.After Tara figured out what was happening to her and that all the other magni viri students had lied to her, used her for their own gain, I wanted nothing more than for her to punch them all in the face and burn everything to the ground. Why, why didn't she destroy Isabella's remains? That's ghost possession 101, when in doubt, always burn or destroy the remains! Simply scattering them in a forest isn't going to do anything.The only redeeming part of the second half is Mr. Hank's kindness and O’Connor’s death. I wanted Tara to fight back harder and not be so forgiving towards people who betrayed her in the most effed up way possible. They all become "found family" way too easily and abruptly in my opinion. It felt like it was only put in as a means to further the plot along and not something that was set up properly or given much thought. Would not recommend reading unless you want to be completely frustrated with the characters and their actions.
5669613921	Thank you Netgalley and HarperCollins for an ARC in exchange for my honest review.I like everything Erica Waters writes. The River Has Teeth is my favorite book of hers - full of swampy sapphic horror that kept you engrossed from the first page to the last. All That Consumes Us gave me a very similar feeling, if you throw in some ivy-covered mausoleums and a creepy gothic campus. All That Consumes Us is a story about a girl with no friends, no family, and no money trying to make it as a college student. When a mysterious (and rich) secret society enters the picture and offers her all her dreams and more, for just a tiny price, how can she say no? I loved a lot of this story. I loved the setting, in particular. It was extremely spooky at times, and I loved the feeling of fear and confusion that permeated the book. The campus was a big star of the show, and really did provide an incredibly disturbing background. I loved a lot of the side characters - Wren, Dr. Hendrix, bless you - and was ultimately really happy with the book.If you like sapphic gothic horror, this book is for you.
5769730770	4.5this was a really captivating premise and i really like how it turned out :)
6132799661	A dark fantasy/horror/academia novel - so right up my alley! Tara is floundering at Corbin College - both academically and financially. But then a member of the elusive Magni Viri is tragically found dead and suddenly Tara is given her spot. Once there, her financial woes are gone and she is starting to do well in her classes and in her writing. But there is something off about Magni Viri, something off about the writing that she does at all hours of the night. Will Tara discover Magni Viri’s secrets before it’s too late?Hard to put down - quite the gripping read! I liked all of the characters and the descriptions of Corbin College and its environs were spot on gothic. Tara (despite being my namesake) was harder to get into in the first half of the book though. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me an ARC of this book!
5537153897	I cannot recommend this book ENOUGH! Please pre-order it/buy it when it releases because... Oh my goodness. 5/5 stars completely I love this book so much. We got secret societies, we got a sapphic/queer MC, we got NONBINARY rep and... supernatural happenings? My goodness I completely soared through this book and I just loved it so much! I know I already read it, but when the physical copies hit stores, I'm going to speed to the bookstore to pick up a copy! :) (NetGalley Review!!)
5335580519	I am emotionally compromised by Gay Ghosts and Living Bisexuals now, thanks.Okay but for real, this was really good. It didn’t go where I thought it was going but I liked where it went, it spoke to my own insecurity and gifted kid burnout and feelings about my creativity, and I needed that more than I realized. Also I love how the disabled character is framed as dapper and desirable throughout the whole thing, I really appreciated that
5272646882	All That Consumes Us is about a first-generation college student, Tara, who is in way over her head. But when she is offered a spot in a prestigious academic society, she jumps at the chance… even if that means replacing a girl who was recently found dead in the library! Filled with spooky hauntings, atmospheric settings, and a queer found family ensemble cast, this book is sure to delight dark academia readers!
5894473973	with how the latest new release lets me down, i'm so, so glad this one didn't. some parts does frustrate me and felt like it got glossed over too quickly, but the story itself is resolved well, the build-up towards the reveal isn't too much or too little, and the characters have their own voices. i'd say it's quite solid and i really like it
5930737936	Thanks to Netgalley and HarperCollins for the ARC of this spooky secret society story! This was perfectly atmospheric and creepy. A really interesting look at the price of fame, I found this to be very compelling. Just right for fall reading.
5953303515	RTC
5945768927	Queer dark academia is my jam, and this might be my favorite Erica Waters book. I loved the spooky ghosts and the idea of losing yourself to pay for your future.
5943261332	I adored this. Peak dark academia.
5558353378	[ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley]That cover is everything to me. The story itself? 😬😬 if you're looking for a dull YA dark academia thriller with annoying characters, pick it up.
5298057670	This is such a brilliant dark academia YA horror/thriller!!
5811062810	Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the ARC. For a YA novel this was very good. I enjoyed the gothic atmosphere and the dark academia theme. I enjoyed Tara as a character. Great book.
6158192839	Astoundingly pathetic and dimwitted protagonist. Wasn’t sold on the romance. Wasn’t sold on the found family. Kept saying “no shit, girl” when Tara figured things out at the speed of smell.
5949185268	Good dark academia title with no sexy times. And even though it takes place in college, the main character and her non-binary roommate are both 17.
6170393793	** spoiler alert ** IF I COULD RATE HIGHER I WOULD. THIS BOOK WAS AN EMPTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER. I ALMOST CRIED 6 TIMES. ALMOST 400 OAGES OF AN ENCHANCHTING STORY THAT IS ABT A CULT SOVIETY INSIDE A PRESTOGOUS COLLEGE.this books queer elements have me dying. The ending had me relived and so glad to see full development of basically all the characters. The whole society turning out to be based on the creatators undying homosexual love is my new roman empire.Also the eveloment of figuring out the haunting was so mind blowing to me. And then the connection of the people and their ghost.Tara and isabells connection of life and writing has me staring at my ceiling wondering and thinking abt how I got to this very momeny. I will purchase a copy of this at some point of another. I'm crying as I write this so sorry for mistakes. Overall this book made me suicidal in the most delicious best way possible.(Wern is a W character.)
7360602876	** spoiler alert ** A fantastic dark academia story! Our main character, Tara, was relatable, and I found myself rooting for her the entire time. After taking the place of a dead girl in a prestigious writing course, it's time for her to prove herself. That's when things get interesting. Wrestling with possession, sleep deprivation, and imposter syndrome, our FMC has to uncover the secrets of her school. I loved the lgbtqia romance and the lingering sense of foreboding and mystery! There is an undercurrent of danger throughout the novel. I wish the side characters were featured a little more in the story, but that's a small complaint. I would have also liked more interactions with some of the older students at the academy. Overall, this is a perfect, atmospheric read to get you in the mood for spooky season! It's creepy without being scary. It is a fantastic addition to the YA world. 8.5/10
6438232042	2.5✰I have no idea why I am still bummed out when a YA book turns out a little immature. Maybe since it was set in college, I expected more? The direct references to "The Secret History", "Jane Eyre" and "Carmilla" also set up expectations but delivered next to nothing (what is the point of a reference if you do not truly engage with it? Are you just signalling you have been on Tumblr or, even worse, on TikTok?)I think there were the bones of a good story but not the meat. Everything that happens after Tara's discovery feels like the author was just throwing anything at the wall. Last but not least, I have to acknowledge that maybe reading this as an audiobook was not the best way to approach the book. The narration did very little to bring in gothic atmosphere to the novel - an opportunity missed.
6312059538	Where do I even begin. This book literally “consumed” me, it was absolutely beautiful and I really could not put it down. I was wrapped up in the characters and almost felt a hole in my heart when I finished the book, knowing I won’t get to read it anymore or see the characters anymore. This book brought me so much heart wrenching emotion and left me on the edge of my seat, audibly gasping quite a few times. It was beautifully written and from the very first to the very last page I was utterly hooked. I could feel all of the emotion emanating from the golden pages and cannot wait to purchase this book. I will certainly be reading it over again. The moment I finished it I was so tempted to pick it up and start it over. Frightening twists I never would have expected, I am glad I did not read the back of the book and went into it blind instead. It made the experience all the more surprising. My gratitude and love to Erica Waters, thank you for publishing this treasure.
5987919251	Queer lore, chosen family, and secret society in a dark academic setting: the secrets of Magni Viri are uncovered after an outsider joins their ranks. Solving the mystery proves difficult, but it isn’t long until Tara discovers what is behind the academic success and enigmatic acclaim of her peers. The discovery reveals the secret as to why they are kept up at all hours of the night, every night. Definitely a niche read with some minor flaws in storytelling. Though I did enjoy the concept and autumnal neo gothic atmosphere.
6644661905	Characters: 1 star, not a single character had depth Setting: 4 stars, I love a gothic academic secret society setting. Ya got me there Plot: 2.5 stars, I went into a major reading slump during the middle third and the last third had me skimming just to finish the book. It felt like some things were finalized and wrapped up but then an extra 50 pgs of action were added at the end? Overall, the plot was drawn out with a lot of “why do I care” moments and maybe a more invested reader could elaborate on why you should care.
6131902292	this book is as if the secret history was a gothic YA ghost story, very rooted in the aesthetic dark academia and the malicious tendencies of vengeful spirits. the pacing of this made it difficult to get into, moving from very slow to very fast, and there were too many characters for me to get truly invested in, but i will say that the initial twist at about the halfway point was unexpected and helped me get reinvested. if you care for ghosts this may be for you.
5853250824	The concept of the secret society Magni Viri and how it stays hauntingly out of reach for most is a great picture the author depicted when writing this story. It gave me old school 90s vibes and had a great slow burn of a storyline. The characters were full of life and the narrator did a great job at giving everyone a voice and emotion that matched what was going on in the story. Great read.
5811711044	This book was a murder mystery, haunting, and coming of age all in one, not to mention a tale of star crossed lovers, the cost of ambition, and family. If it seems like this book would’ve been all over the place, it wasn’t! Erica managed to weave all of these beautiful themes into one spooky, aesthetic and compelling read that had me surprised at every turn. I thought I knew where the book was heading but then it went elsewhere, and I loved it! Would recommend to anyone, especially those who haven’t read a thriller/horror story before since this felt like a tame entry into the genre.
5852387455	I am not a horror fan, but this book had me in it's clutches from beginning to end. The story/mystery was fantastic, the characters were diverse and complex, and the scary was just scary enough for this scaredy-cat. Bravo! 5 Stars
