5380661727	a dark academia anthology? what more could the book community ask for in 2023? i had some hits and a few misses, but overall i did enjoy this collection for the most part. for sure a mixed bag, but that's always to be expected with a short story collection, but i feel like if dark academia appeals to you, you will probably have a decent time with this one! down below is my break downs and feelings regarding every short story in the collection, also with trigger and content warnings i found while reading.━━♡ 1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg ★★an autumn college campus setting, a student with masochistic tendencies and a professor who bullies and belittles his students, and a morning of their relationship before the professor goes to a hearing at the dean's house to try to clear his name from the involvement of a student's death. this was a very atmospheric introduction to what will be a full story soon, and i was very enthralled with what was happening throughout, but upon finishing it just felt bad that our mc didn't care about all the horrible things until something impacted her. tw/cw: student + college professor relationships, power imbalances, grey area consent, infidelity, mention of suicide, inducing pain on oneself, unwanted pictures being taken, use of the slur for romani people to describe a blouse. ━━♡ Pythia by Olivie Blake ★★★★★ “Watching it was like watching a potion get made, where you could see the sparkle of magic or the ether or whatever it was pouring into the code itself, like honey from an open wound.” it is not a secret that i love olivie blake and her writing, but this short story was just harrowing and heartfelt perfection to me. it is very timely, with perfect parallels, and some of the most beautiful writing that truly makes me ache with so much feeling. this story is told q&a style through a legal proceeding deposition, with a case involving a super computer and the involvement of deaths on campus. i really loved this one and everything it had to say (so softly yet so loudly). tw/cw: talk of murder + suicide, power imbalances, a lot of talk of mental health, very brief mentions of a lot of horrible things in this world.━━♡ Sabbatical by James Tate Hill ★★★i liked our mc, i really loved his cat, and i was interested in where this story was going! this is about a teacher trying to find out what was happening between a former faculty member, looking for another former faculty member, who was knocking on an empty professor's room next to his! but sadly i just ended up not loving this one as much as i hoped i would, even though i did enjoy the writing and trying to figure out things alongside our mc. i also might be wild for my interpretation of the ending of this one, but i enjoyed my feelings at the ending of this, too! tw/cw: ableism, fatphobia, talk of forced hospitalization, infidelity, death/murder, joke about gun violence.━━♡ The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew ★i feel like i just really disliked this one from the start >.< basically a kid receives a prophecy when he is young and it has haunted him all the way to university, but also the things he has done in the time between has been haunting him, too. i don't know, i feel bad but the "descent into madness or very obvious supernatural element" really just didn't do it for me here.tw/cw: car accident in past, death/murder in past, hurt animal, talk of loss of a sibling in past, nightmares, animal death. ━━♡ X House by J.T. Ellison ★★★★ “She doesn’t want to be an anxiety-ridden mouse who’s afraid of the dark and doesn’t like to be alone.” a very isolated boarding school built a long time ago next to a lake and ocean, with four separate houses, and our story taking place in the house that is separated by a very creepy bridge, switching perspectives between a girl who just lost her roommate and a new professor sent to protect the six remaining girls! the setting and premise were perfection, truly. i was teleported and so intrigued. i am not sure i loved the story completely upon finishing the last page, but it was a solid short story that really kept me captivated while reading. tw/cw: talk of suicide in past, panic attacks, anxiety, bullying, gun violence, violence, blood, and death━━♡ The Ravages by Layne Fargo ★★★women's academy archivist is cataloging letters from sapphics of the past, while her relationship with her own girlfriend just got destroyed in the very library she works at. but unlike the letters from the past - our mc wants revenge in the archives. i really enjoyed this one and i thought the ending was extra cute. tw/cw: infidelity, an offhanded mention in a sentence of self harm/suicide, seance performance.━━♡ Four Funerals by David Bell ★this just felt so disrespectful because of the subject matter. i also think this was a weird choice for a selection in a dark academia collection. but we see a professor living with survivor's guilt and being immensely disrespectful, while going to four funerals of his four students when the families are expressing they do not want him there. tw/cw: school shootings, suicide mention, miscarriage in past mention, vomit, loss of sibling in past mention, ptsd, and harassment. ━━♡ The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang ★★i really don't know how to feel about this one. themes of religious upbringings and current environments and also people sometimes speculating, and obsessing, and even fetishizing, queer relationships. the author doesn't write this story in a positive light, but i just felt really meh about it, and wasn't really interested in it at any point, and felt a little gross while reading it. tw/cw: blood, sickness, one sentence mention of family history of cancer, student teacher relationships (some kind of power imbalance dynamic going on), and fetishization.━━♡ Weekend at Bertie’s by M.L. Rio ★★★so two things first off: 1) this was, hands down, the most anticipated short story of the whole collection and 2.) i have never seen weekend at bernie's! the atmosphere and writing of this was beautiful. i'm just not sure i loved the story itself, but that could be because i am unfamiliar with the original source material. but back to begging for more of whatever ml rio is willing to give us.tw/cw: a lot of drinking, smoking, death, vomit, mention of surprise pregnancy, unwanted touching, one sentence description involving cancer imagery ━━♡ The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant ★★★this one was actually scary (i say, being a baby, but still). the basic premise is a girl in the 80s, doing her undergrad, finds a mysterious hidden locked door with the words "department of ontography", and she becomes obsessed. i feel like the writing was just hard for me to get into, and i kept thinking this story was way older than the 80s. also, why did she wait 30 years to do a thing she knew to do then? overall, i like how this was scary and different for the anthology, but it's not a fave.tw/cw: drinking, vomit, missing person/loved one, human experimentation, body horror━━♡ Phobos by Tori Bovalino ★★★a secret society, one more challenge, one final sacrifice for the order. this short story felt the most dark academia to me. i really ate up the writing and setting and was so very intrigued. sadly, i kind of felt the twist coming, so my enjoyment was dampened, but i still had a good time getting there. but this is the reason why i love short story collections, because now i want to read more from this author. tw/cw: drinking, assault, murder ━━♡ Playing by Phoebe Wynne ★★maybe not the best story to end on. i wish this one was swapped with the one before it. we see an organist playing at a church where elderly people keep dying and she suspects there could be more to the story. i just knew what was going on from page two, and it really did hinder my enjoyment, but the miss marple sentence did make me giggle. tw/cw: blood, death, murder, funeral setting, anxietyblog | instagram | youtube | kofi | spotify | amazon━━♡ buddy read with evie + penny
5703186431	Happy publication day!Overall, this collection of dark academia stories was an eclectic mixed bag. As expected, some stories were thematically relevant, gripping, moody and twisty. Other stories were a bit of a stretch for what I would classify as dark academia. My top picks of the anthology are:○ The Hare and the Hound○ Phobos○ Pythia○ The Professor of Ontography1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg: ⭐⭐⭐/ 3 starsThis is an intriguing, dark first chapter of a full novel called The Truants. I didn’t feel I had enough time to connect with Lorna Clay, and I was perplexed about how this was meant to be dark academia. Pythia by Olivie Blake: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/ 4 starsIf you like techno-horror shows like Black Mirror, you’ll probably like this one. This timely tale explores the ethical implications of technology, exploring what it means to be human and the longing for genuine emotional connections. It is a unique format with a Q&A deposition + traditional narrative storytelling. I thought it would’ve been stronger as purely futuristic and speculative sci-fi and eliminated the fantasy/magical element, which was only vaguely explained. Still, it was one of the more memorable reads in this anthology.Sabbatical by James Tate Hill: ⭐/ 1 starMaybe the author intended for the MC and supporting cast to be unlikeable. Still, the churlish narration, especially when the MC and other characters spoke of weight and mental illness, didn’t sit comfortably with me. The one star is for the cat, Edward.The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/ 4.5 starsA creepy folkloric, whimsical and magical realism-infused horror short story that gripped me from beginning to end, about a boy tormented by inner demons and a prophecy he received from a seer at a fair regarding a white rabbit. One of my personal favourites in this anthology. Must remember to investigate more of Kelly Andrew.X House by J.T Ellison: ⭐⭐⭐/ 3.5 starsReminiscent of The Grace Year meets boarding school stories, this short story explores the twisted, sinister depths of teenage girl cliques and relationships. However, the pacing wasn’t quite right, and I felt that a more in-depth length would’ve allowed this story to realise its full potential via richer world-building and plot.The Ravages by Layne Fargo: ⭐⭐⭐/ 3 starsNothing groundbreaking, but revenge on a cheating lover is a dependable and entertaining trope. Four Funerals by David Bell: DNFTrigger warning: The subject matter of gun violence and school shootings is one I choose to actively avoid in my pursuit of reading for escapism and enjoyment. Skipped.The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang: ⭐⭐⭐/ 3.25 starsA tale of an almost fetish-voyeuristic obsession over a charismatic professor and a speculated relationship with a student. The ending built up to what could’ve been a well-executed reveal or climatic point but then ended up being anticlimactic—bold artistic choice, although it left me unsatisfied.Weekend at Berties by M.L Rio: ⭐⭐⭐/ 3.5 starsA solid character study in this one, with some lovely prose. This story explores the morals of what people would do if they found the dead body of an acquaintance in their house. Felt unfinished.The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/ 4 starsCreepily satisfying and uncanny love-horror story with an ending that gave me nostalgic R.L. Stine Goosebumps vibes.Phobos by Tori Bovalino: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/ 4.5 starsThis one was a gripping, dark story with Ninth House vibes, exploring disturbing initiation rites into secret societies and the depraved extremities humans will go to in order to belong and get a leg up in life. This had a satisfying length, plot and ending despite being a short story. Still, I wouldn’t be bummed if Tori Bovalino expanded this into a longer book. It makes my top 3 in this anthology collection!Playing by Phoebe Wynne: ⭐⭐⭐/ 3 starsWhile the “reveal” was almost immediately obvious, this premise had intrigue and potential. Maybe it would be better executed as a longer story. I appreciate what seemed to be authentic musical knowledge of the keys engrained into the story. My heartfelt thanks to NetGalley and Titan Books for the opportunity to read this work in exchange for an honest review.Read the full review.
5166782855	This is not a dark academia anthology. This is a collection of mysteries that each have some vague connection to college. Though there is a lot of debate around what works should be considered “dark academia,” very few of the stories in this collection gave me the dark, moody, and all-encompassing atmosphere that I have come to expect. There are definitely a few stories in here that deliver on the promised atmosphere—X House, The Professor of Ontography, and Phobos in particular. But others simply centered a professor or were set near a college (Four Funerals and The Hare and the Hound for example). The ones that leaned into the weird and obsessive were definitely the strongest. Overall the term dark academia was applied very loosely and I am a bit disappointed. My favorite stories were: Pythia, The Unknowable Pleasures, and The Professor of Ontography 1000 Ships | Kate Weinberg | 3 stars: Not the strongest opening to the anthology. A relatively generic premise. Some of the word choices were questionable. Pythia | Olivie Blake | 4.5 stars: I hesitate to call this dark academia, but I appreciated the focus on STEM. This was one of my favorite stories in the collection. The mix between traditional narrative and interview question and answer format was very clever. I really loved the reveal at the end. The explanation of “technomancy” was a bit weak. It would have made more sense to portray it as futuristic computer science rather than trying to weave magic into the explanation. Person of interest anyone?Sabbatical | James Tate Hill | 1 star: This one was terrible. It was a bizarre crisis without even the bare minimum connection to dark academia. I was appalled by the way mental illness was portrayed. The Hare and the Hound | Kelly Andrew | 4 stars: This was an incredibly satisfying descent into madness story with a great pay off. X House | JT Ellison | 3 stars: An interesting concept that reminded me a lot of A Lesson in Vengeance. The dark academia vibes were there but it didn’t work crammed into a short story. The reveal was way too easy and the pacing was off. The Ravages | Layne Fargo | 4 stars: Nothing shocking or unique and it does fade into obscurity when I consider the collection as a whole but I was entertained. Four Funerals | David Bell | 2 stars: I don’t know if I like how this story handled the subject matter. It had the beginnings of an interesting exploration of trauma and blame. The Unknowable Pleasures | Susie Yang | 4.5 stars: This one will probably be divisive because of the repulsive behavior of the main character. Yang delivers an intriguing story of obsession that subtly builds. It kind of felt like it pulled back from a confrontation/climax at the last second which left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. But that definitely could have been the intention. I would definitely be interested in seeing this as a full length novel. There is so much potential to play with an unreliable narrator. Weekend at Bertie’s | ML Rio | 4 stars: I love ML Rio’s writing so, of course, I enjoyed this one. The characters were intriguing and there were some interesting lines towards the end about morality. However, it felt like the story lacked a point. The Professor of Ontography | Helen Grant | 5 stars: The ending of this story was actually nauseating and so unexpected. A very eery story that would make a fascinating full-length novel told retrospectively. Phobos | Tori Bovalino | 3.5 stars: An interesting take on the concept of secret societies and inequality in academia. Would have hit me harder as a full-length novel. Playing | Phoebe Wynne | 2.5 stars: I am honestly indifferent towards this one. It was definitely creepy but heavy-handed and obvious.

6490360162	3.75/5O ile ze zbiorami opowiadań jednego autora nie mam już takiego poczucia niedosytu o tyle tutaj znów wróciła chęć czytania dalej, szczególnie przy opowiadaniu „Tysiąc okrętów”, „Pies i królik” i „Profesor ontografii”. Ale może to kwestia tego, że po prostu szalenie mi się podobały. Całość wypada naprawdę w porządku, szczególnie biorąc pod uwagę jak różnych autorów tu mamy. Klimacik!
5716320490	1000 SHIPS details an affair between a student and a professor where he is being investigated for another student’s suicide.This gives My Dark Vanessa vibes. Deeply uncomfortable, dark, and vengeful. PYTHIA is part deposition, part explanation from a clinical psychologist who’s being questioned after a suicide of a student involved in a cult of technomancers who believed that their supercomputer knew all and predicted all. I found it funny that the computer was basically diagnosed with anxiety and got better because the psychologist basically treated it as if there was nothing wrong (virus etc.) with it. THE HARE AND THE HOUND is a magical realism psychological horror. ”One day, a white rabbit will appear to you. For most, the hare is a symbol of blessing and renewal, but for you it is to be a harbinger of great misfortune. On the tail of the rabbit's arrival, you will meet a girl. Should you give chase, you will pursue her into the mouth of the wolf, and you will be consumed by the madness that follows."Now, Mason, nicknamed Bunny, is at college and haunted by an innocent biking accident where he injured a rabbit and a girl called Arlen who suddenly appears with an injured arm and the same coloured eyes and hair as the rabbit. This was delightfully creepily terrifying! I loved it!SABBATICAL was probably my least favourite. A former professor fired for being a nut case reappears looking for another old professor who has disappeared without a trace. This just felt fairly pointless and boring sadly. X HOUSE follows a professor named Mia who has a new job in a place where madness is rumoured to call. Six girls to teach. Six girls to keep safe. Six girls to keep alive for the rest of term. Someone is trying to murder the young women of Xavier House, and Mia is here to stop them.Think extreme hazing. Short and pretty predictable.Their attentions hurt, but they also feel good. They make Lily feel special in ways she never has before.THE RAVAGES is what happens when you catch your witchy and seance-obsessed girlfriend making out with someone else in the aisles of the archives. Even after we are both in our graves, I hope the ravages of your betrayal torment your withered soul.A fun lil revenge story. FOUR FUNERALS is about a teacher who travels to four funerals for his students who died in a mass shooting by a classmate which he planned out in a creative writing workshop. This was pretty forgettable as it was so short and straight forward, but the emphasis on survivors guilt was poignant. THE UNKNOWABLE PLEASURES is about a girl who becomes obsessed with a relationship between a fellow student and professor which turns into an almost fantasy for her to make her own life more interesting. She often wondered if she'd been born in the wrong century. People seemed to live so differently in the past, with real purpose and romance - true romance - born of suffering and sacrifice and courage, not this modern-day idea of romance made up of cheap words, alcohol, and trivial gestures. Perhaps the problem with her and Alan's relationship was that they had never done any thing to earn their love, like survive a war or fight through insurmountable obstacles (disapproving parents, societal judgment, physical separation) to be together.Honestly, a relatable outlook for any reader who feels inadequate on the face of unachievable romance and stakes.WEEKEND AT BERTIES finds a dead body in the basement and a plan hatched between the two people who find her to take her life savings for themselves - a victimless crime as she has no dependents. I don’t know if I misread this of what, but I didn’t really understand the point of it.THE PROFESSOR OF ONTOGRAPHY is about a student who is one of the first girls to be admitted to study at a college who discovers the mysterious and unknowable Department of Ontology with her boyfriend. This was creeeepyyy. Yes, it was predictable but this was definitely the most horrifying. PHOBUS is about the Initiation into the Order of Prometheus which requires the completion of nine challenges. Fairly predictable with a dark look on what humans will do to feel like we belong. PLAYING is an ode for musicians. The pure, goody-two-shoes, above-everyone-else organ player spotting a link between a string of funerals she’s asked to play at. Tonight she would play barefoot, barehanded and barefaced, as close to herself as she could get inside the music.Normally I’m not a huge short story fan. I can’t connect to the characters, there’s not enough time to develop a coherent story, there’s not enough world-building or connection. However, this was enjoyable. A nice break from the long books and sagas I’ve been reading. I think if dark academia is your jam - you’ll love this!Bookstagram
5167447797	to quote my own tweet, someone tell publishers that being set at a school or any other academic setting does not mean it is dark academia Rating: 1.5 stars Review: Thank you kindly to NetGalley and the publisher for this arc in exchange for an honest review. Unfortunately I struggled finishing this book, I did not find most of the short stories engaging or compelling. The nature of these stories being short did nothing to showcase the talent of these authors, many of whom I’ve read previous works of and enjoyed. I think it is also warranted to mention that for an anthology that it is marketed as dark academia, the stories had nothing tying them together or to dark academia itself, other than a shallow undertone of the popular aesthetic or by throwing in a loose tie to some sort of academic setting. Dark academia at its core has some theme or critique of the genre, it is not just a setting where the characters wear plaid. I think calling most of those stories “dark academia” was a stretch at best and a money grab marketing tactic at worst. I’m disappointed to say that this wasn’t for me at all.
5732472742	I had high hopes for this anthology because even though I usually don’t love short stories, the idea of a collection of them taking place in a dark academia setting was really appealing to me. Sadly, the majority of these stories were a miss for me, but I enjoyed a couple of them.➼ 1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg: ★★★★This was my favorite of the anthology. A prequel to The Truants, this is a story of a college student and her affair with her teacher, who is being investigated for the suicide of another student. The author managed to intrigue me enough to want to read her full-length novel.➼ Pythia by Olivie Blake: ★This one was kind of a scif-i story about AI and it intersperses an interview with the narration. It bored me from start to finish.➼ Sabbatical by James Tate Hill: ★I would say that calling this story dark academia is a bit of a stretch. It’s a story about a professor who decides to get involved in finding another teacher who has been missing for years. I didn’t like the writing or the story itself.➼ The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew: ★★★This one follows a young man who was involved in an accident that resulted in the death of another teenage girl and how he can’t escape his past, no matter how hard he tries. I liked the spooky and paranormal vibes of this one, even though I saw the twist coming from a mile away.➼ X House by J.T. Ellison: ★★This story had a very promising beginning, but I ended up being disappointed by the turn it took. It’s about a new teacher infiltrated in a school where several mysterious deaths have taken place in recent months.➼ The Ravages by Layne Fargo: ★★★I liked this one. A spooky story about a girl and her cheating girlfriend deciding to play with an ouija and everything that unravels from there.➼ Four Funerals by David Bell: ★★This was a story about the aftermath of a school shooting and follows a teacher who blames himself and decides to attend the four funerals of his students. It has some interesting discussions, but overall it wasn’t my cup of tea. I also don’t think this one can be called dark academia.➼ The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang: ★★★This one was quite interesting. It’s about an unlikeable young woman getting obsessed with the idea of her teacher and one of her classmates having a secret relationship. I was a little disappointed by the abrupt ending.➼ Weekend at Bertie’s by M.L. Rio: ★★I was particularly excited about reading this one because I recently read If We Were Villains and loved it. So I wanted to read more from this author. Unfortunately, I felt kind of meh about this one. It’s about two characters that find the body of a colleague and decide to take her money.➼ The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant: ★★★This story is probably the most spooky of the collection. It had me very intrigued from start to finish, but I wasn’t impressed by the final twist.➼ Phobos by Tori Bovalino: ★★★It follows a student who is taking a series of trials in order to become part of a secret society but who has to decide how far she’s willing to go when the society asks her to kill someone. I liked the vibes, although I saw the plot twist coming.➼ Playing by Phoebe Wynne: ★★The story of a church organist hinting that the older people who used to go to church and who recently died were actually murdered. I felt quite indifferent about this one. That said, maybe it’s because I read it when I was about to fall asleep, but I was surprised by the ending.Overall, I didn’t enjoy the majority of these stories and I personally consider that half of them aren’t even dark academia. But I’ll keep an eye on future releases of the authors whose stories I enjoyed.ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Instagram | Twitter
6468471734	3.5/5Dwanaście krótkich, niepokojących opowiadań w klimacie dark academia. Każde różne ale łączy je jedno: przynajmniej jeden trup.Niektóre opowiadania mocno mnie zaintrygowały, inne miały ogromny potencjał ale zakończenie nie satysfakcjonowało przez to, że zazwyczaj było otwarte, a takie niedopowiedzenia strasznie mnie irytują.W środku znajdziecie: historię o chłopaku, którego ciała nigdy nie odnaleziono gdy zgubił się na tajemniczym wydziale Ontografii, czy dziwnych zbiegach okoliczności gdy pewna pianistka pogrzebowa nagle dostaje więcej zleceń. Pojawiają się też opowiadania bardziej o naturze i relacjach szczególnie związanych ze zdradą: akademicką czy romantyczną oraz zemście na niewiernych.Niektórzy bohaterowie odkrywają swoje wewnętrze "ja" w kryzysie swoich wartości i przełamaniu moralnej postawy. Szczególnie wtedy, pojawia się prawdziwa natura człowieka, która skłania go do pewnych czynów, a mi szczególnie podobała się doza tajemnicy w tych wzbudzających refleksje historiach.Polecam by wyjść poza swoją strefę komfortu czytelniczego, szczególnie na jesień by wczuć się bardziej w klimat opowiadań.
5509198316	3.5 ⭐️Dokładnie taka średnia wyszła mi po zsumowaniu moich ocen każdego opowiadania w tym zbiorze. W takich momentach cieszę się, że poprzez krótką formę mogę poznać twórczość pisarzy o których nie miałam pojęcia.Z drugiej strony boli, gdy autorki których nazwiska na okładce zachęciły cię do przeczytania tak koncertowo wypadły najgorzej (patrzę na was Blake i Rio) ☠️💔Do niektórych opowiadań z pewnością będę wracać.

5577868621	3.87 starsOverall, I liked this anthology a lot - there were a few stories that really gripped me and that I would absolutely loved to read full length novels of, while there were also a couple of stories that didn't feel like they fit in with the others selected. My favourite short story in this anthology was The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant!1000 Ships - Kate WeinbergSo interesting! I found myself wanting to read more straight away - it had the same vibes as "My Dark Vanessa", so it was incredibly gripping. I do wish we'd had more insight into what happened with the student case that was occurring in the background. I also think that if it is a short story, it should be able to be wrapped up within that story, rather than functioning as the first chapter of a full novel.4/5Pythia - Olivie BlakeI felt very confused throughout this. I didn't understand what was going on or what Pythia was - is it a Scythe Thunderhead situation? So baffled sadly.3/5Sabbatical - James Tate HillThis had me very intrigued! There was a lot that felt quite confusing, but it was tense and I enjoyed the buildup to the climax of the story! It was a little predictable but enjoyable, and I would definitely read this as a full-length book!4/5The Hare and the Hound - Kelly AndrewOkay now this is what I was waiting for! Creepy, unsettling, eerie, mysterious, this was exactly the kind of short story I was wanting. I loved that it wrapped up perfectly, and how the story played out was very satisfying!5/5X House - J.T. EllisonHonestly it just felt a bit underwhelming. I like the setting, but having dual POVs in such a SHORT short story meant that there was no tension, and it also felt as though there was no clear reasoning for the events that happened either?3/5The Ravages - Layne FargoI enjoyed this a lot! It was entertaining and a bit spooky - I loved the revenge plotline and the characters were very interesting; this felt a lot like a classic ghost story told around a campfire which was very cool!4/5Four Funerals - David BellInteresting, but I'm not sure this exactly fits with the other dark academia short stories. There is murder involved, but the story is actually quite quiet and sad, really. I did like it though, I'm just not sure it fits with the others.4/5The Unknowable Pleasures - Susie YangI was really enjoying this up until the end! The ending was pretty disappointing, but the rest of the story was so intriguing and ever so slightly eerie. Reading from the perspective of Sophie, in the beginnings of a stalker/obsessive mindset, was really fascinating, I just wish it hadn't ended in such an anticlimactic way!4.5/5Weekend at Bertie's - M.L. RioAgain, I don't really see how this fits in with the other dark academia stories? There is a death, but it's really just two people chatting in a house for the vast majority of the story. I also didn't understand why the two characters didn't call the police straight away? It didn't make much sense to me.3/5The Professor of Ontography - Helen GrantI both hate and love this story - it was so, SO good, and I could not wait to find out the ending; I was on the edge of my seat the whole time reading it.

5167119548	Thank you Titan for the ARC!What a wonderful anthology from some of my favourite authors. I really enjoyed seeing how each contributor put their own spin on the genre— from horror to secret societies, grief and obsession, each story was unique and a stand-alone display of talent and storytelling. My favourites were Kelly Andrew’s take on a whimsical and feverish horror-romance, Tori Bovalino’s vicious secret society and Helen Grant’s twisty thriller about a reclusive university department and the horrors it’s concealing. Like any anthology, not all were to my taste but overall if you’re a fan of dark academia this is a great taster of the genre and a perfect example of some stellar author’s short form work!
5508968827	➵ 4.2 ⭐️ This was a great anthology! I'd definitely recommend In These Hallowed Halls to anyone who wants to read dark academia but doesn't know where to start but also to anyone like me who's in the mood but can't make up their mind what book to pick up lol.This pic is from Jill's Tumblrand this is my bookstagramMy absolute fav stories were Phobos, Weekend at Bertie's, The Hare and the Hound, The Professor of Ontography and Pythia.Phobos by Tori Bovalino is dark academia at its best - secret societies, privilege, power, murder - the whole story was like a love letter to Ninth House and all books like it and I absolutely devoured it. As far as I'm concerned Tori can do no wrong and I only wish her story was a whole novel instead. Her debut The Devil Makes Three is one of my all time favs so if you read Phobos and you fall in love with it you should read TDM3 next. Weekend at Bertie's is another one that just had me in its thrall the whole time. I've been meaning to read If We Were Villains for the longest time maybe now is the time.Sabbatical and Playing were the only 2 I didn't really connect with or like. I found both boring and Playing was too repetitive. They just weren't for me at all.- 1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg - 4 ⭐️ - Pythia by Olivie Blake - 4.5 ⭐️ - Sabbatical by James Tate Hill - 2.5 ⭐️ - The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew - 5 ⭐️ - X House by J.

6286102557	I personally loved this Anthology and felt that each Author understood the assignment on "Dark Academia". I appreciate that this brought many unknown Author's to my attention and there were some definite favorites here that continue to linger in my mind. 1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg I really enjoyed this story! It may be a slight nod to Helen of Troy mixed in with elements of deceit, trust, and naivety in an academic setting. After finishing, the Author stated that this story is a prequel to her book The Truants. Which, I immediately added to my TBR pile! Pythia by Olivie Blake What a weird and interesting short story. A few times, I did have to reread sentences because I wasn't certain if the passages were inner thoughts, speaking to the reader, or spoken aloud dialogue. But, overall I enjoyed it; even if I felt that this was much more in the realm of Sci-Fi (in my opinion) and pushing on the limits of a Academia setting. Sabbatical by James Tate Hill This was a short story on a Professor, who I personally felt had a sad existence...a muted, gray life. I felt attached to his melancholy, even if it wasn't screaming on page. He seemed to have a charisma that maybe he wasn't aware of? And the event that he found himself in the middle of, was handled with such a level of cool and unbothered emotion that I found it to be the perfect end to the short story. The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew ***This was a favorite of mine*** This story really stood out to me and I am still thinking about it. It was intriguing, mysterious, slight horror element (depending on your perception, I suppose) and this wonderful Nordic Folklore sprinkled in. I loved this so much, I ran out and purchased her other available book and preordered the next! X House by J.T. Ellison A school with a chilling reputation and mystery...that had a devious conclusion. I loved the bluntness of this story. It had me guessing with the more that I learned. The Ravages by Layne Fargo What a wicked fun tale with a cherry on top of Feminine Rage. I loved this story. Scorned lover that may even be bordering a possessive nature line? The ending is open to interpretation in my opinion. Four Funerals by David Bell This one may actually be quite uncomfortable for many readers and I completely understand that. The story revolves around a fatal school shooting. However, I am thinking that this Author's intent was to be thought provoking. And a zoomed in focus on all individuals affected by something as horrible and tragic as victims/families of victims/survivors of a horrific tragedy. Maybe going as far as to show the different faucets of humanity and how lives change for all during an act of unbelievable violence. It was a very sad story. The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang This was an interesting take on obsession to a varying degree. But, also straddles that line of longing and what motivates our dedication towards intimate relationships. Weekend at Bertie's by M.L. Rio Interesting plot line...this was kind of a story based on two questionable amoral characters that kind of get away with this terrible thing. The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant ***This was another favorite*** I seriously can not stop thinking about this story. It was surprisingly sad and horrific. I feel it haunting me a bit, but in the best way. The way that this Author was able to grip me so fiercely within such a short amount of time, I was extremely impressed. Phobos by Tori Bovalino This was maybe the only one that I didn't quite get pulled into with the writing. I think I needed more time with the characters and plotline in order to be interested. It was a quick peek into a Secret Society and the ending was slightly shocking just because I felt it was at odds with the character's decision. Maybe that was the point? I'm not sure. Playing by Phoebe Wynne I thought that this was the perfect story for the Finale in this Anthology! The star of this story was everything she needed to be and I felt like there are not enough characters written like this, especially female characters; it was truly refreshing to read!
6435276924	3.5/5 Największe wrażenie zrobił na mnie “Profesor i Królik”, tuż za nim na podium “Weekend u Bertie” oraz „Profesor ontografii” (tutaj nadal zbieram się po końcówce). Cały zbiór “W tych szacownych murach” również oceniam pozytywnie. Brakowało mi czegoś takiego na polskim rynku, @insignis_media i @wydawnictwostorylight idealnie więc tę lukę wypełniło. I to w tak wizualnie zachwycającym wydaniu! 🙌🏻
5694740720	Ever since it was announced both by Titan Books and by some of the authors in it which I follow, I’ve wanted to read this Dark Academia anthology. I am currently writing my master thesis on DA as a literary genre, and so I’m always looking for new books to add to my ever growing list of DA titles. This anthology also features some authors that I love so I wanted to read their stories as well. Now here is a disclaimer, I have my own set of parameters for the Dark Academia genre, and the books I add to the list and subsequently my thesis need to check some boxes, which are different for example that just being described as being part of the DA aesthetic. For instance, the setting must be an institution of learning, weather a university or boarding school, you can’t have DA without that because DA stems from the Campus Novel, which are essentially fiction set in uni/colleges. DA also features gothic themes, and death in some capacity. That being said, not all the stories in this anthology are part of the Dark Academia genre. Only four out of twelve are, which are as follows: 1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg; X House by J.T. Ellison; Phobos by Tori Bovalino, and Playing by Phoebe Wynne. The rest of the stories can be divided into three categories. Five of them have elements of Dark Academia, which include the aesthetic part, but for some reason they are not fully part of the genre. Sabbatical by James Tate Hill is a Campus Novel (or Campus Short Story in this case) in my opinion. And then we have the two short stories that are in no way Dark Academia, and which make me question why are they even in this anthology at all. These are The Hare and The Hound by Kelly Andrew and Four Funerals by David Bell. I’m going to break down each of the stories below to comment them in more depth. I have given individual ratings to each of the stories, and upon calculating the arithmetic mean and rounding it up, my final rating of this anthology is going to be 4 stars. It is overall, a very good anthology, especially because 5 short stories are 5 stars and that is almost the half. I enjoyed reading these. Let’s take a closer look.»1000 Ships - Kate Weinberg, 5 stars 💫 dark academiaThe opening story of the collection, and what a start! As this was the first story I read it set a very high parameter that for a while I thought no other story was going to match (I don’t tend to read short story collections in order I just choose whichever appeals to me the most first). This is also the shortest story which just proves that quantity does not mean quality. This story is a prequel of the book The Truants, the debut novel of the author and also a Dark Academia novel. I simply loved this story. Not just because it was a DA story, and I was fearful of how many I would encounter on this anthology, but also because as a short story it was a great one. It had a very clear sense of where it was going and what it wanted to say, structurally it had a beginning, middle and end that made sense (you’d be surprised how many short stories don’t). If you’re familiar with The Truants, this story is about Lorna, and it was the story we needed! We learn so much about her and her characterization is incredible.»Pythia - Olivie Blake, 3.5 stars 💫 Much like her famous book The Atlas Six,this story is not part of the Dark Academia genre, however it does have elements included. It is also similar to TAS in the sense that the writing is extremely confusing, apparently on purpose, and to mask the fact that the worldbuilding is a mess. However, somehow this works. The intercalation between an interview and past events, makes you aware of specific information as you go along. There are some great criticism in here as well. I think what genuinely bothered me with this one was the writing, I feel like it was such a great idea and concept but the writing prevented me from fully enjoying it. »Sabbatical - James Tate Hill, 2.5 stars 💫This one appears to be a prequel to the author’s novel Academy Gothic, but I cant verify that because I haven’t read that novel. It was a confusing and average story. This is the one that for me reads very much like a Campus Novel (or Campus Short Story in this case). I just didn’t connect much with this one or find anything special about it, hence the lower rating. »The Hare and The Hound - Kelly Andrew, 3 stars 💫This story is one of the two I don’t consider to have anything DA about it, and I don’t understand why it was even featured in this anthology. This was filled with magical realism and fantasy to the point that made me question why it wasn’t featured in a different themed anthology. It is not a bad story per se, but it’s just so off thematically from the rest. The focus here is not academic life or anything pertaining to it, the focus is a Hare and magical transformations and I was just very annoyed. It was also way too long, one of the longest of the whole anthology, and being longer didn’t even add that much to it. »X House - J.T. Ellison, 5 stars 💫 dark academiaThis one was superb. A masterpiece. A school, with four founders and subsequent four houses, we are introduced to X House and its ruthless girls. This is such a fleshed out short story, incredibly written and you can see how much the author as thought everything through. It also features multiple povs and the organisation in which it was written makes all the difference. This was amazing and so satisfying to read due to its high quality. Again not saying that because it is part of the DA genre, but because as a short story it is such a fantastic one, and so well written. »The Ravages - Layne Fargo, 4 stars 💫Layne Fargo is the author of the insanely good book They Never Learn, and here she follows the theme of female rage and female desire. She is a master of exploring those, and this short story was delicious to read. It’s very strong on the gothic, the atmosphere is intense, and its also very strong on the Dark Academia aesthetic. It does feature DA elements but because of one thing (you’ll know when you read it) I’m refraining from putting it as DA. That is actually the reason why I am rating it 4 stars as well because it could have easily been a 5 if that one thing were different.»Four Funerals - David Bell, 1 star 💫This is the worst story in the anthology and the second one that is not Dark Academia in the least. I am only going to say this once, school shooting is not Dark Academia. I don’t know where this has stemmed from, but it is absurd. It has absolutely nothing to do with what Dark Academia even stands for. Yes, it is something dark that happens in places of learning, it is the complete opposite of what both the genre and the aesthetic of DA stand for. I found it a little offensive that this story was included in the anthology, I feel like the editors made a poor choice to include this one. This is also a story that is a possible trigger warning. It does not describe the events of the shooting per se, it deals with the aftermaths, a.k.a four funerals, but it could still be triggering nonetheless. Also, there is a very strange and possible problematic message at the end of the story where it seems that both the MC and the shooters mother attempt to say that the shooter is blameless of what he’s done. I found it a disservice that this story was featured.»The Unknowable Pleasures - Susie Yang, 3.5 stars 💫This story had everything to be perfect, if it weren’t for the ending!! That’s what I mean when I say a short story should have a clear beginning middle and end, and this one doesn’t!! Gosh, it is so frustrating to me because I was LOVING this up until the end. It has an interesting obsessive main character, that becomes so invested in the lives of her professor and her classmate, it was such an original concept! It’s not fully DA but does have elements and it was almost perfect. I was so excited while I read this, but the ending was so annoying ugh.»Weekend at Bertie’s - M.L. Rio, 2.5 stars 💫I can’t believe I am giving this such a low rating but here we are. This was one of my most anticipated stories from this anthology. It’s the first piece of writing we’ve had from the author of If We Were Villains in years, and yet here we are. It was not what I expected. In both the DA sense, so little elements, and it is not set in an institution of learning… It was annoyingly frustrated because it could be fixed easily, and also in the sense of short story format, this was the type of short story that I hate. The one that feels unfinished, like a chapter in the middle of a book that you’re just trying to caught up to. It made me feel lost. It also has a very unremarkable writing which was not what I expect from M.L. Rio at all. Overall, this was boring and nobody is sorrier to say that than I am.»The Professor of Ontography - Helen Grant, 5 stars 💫This story will live in my mind for years to come. It is one of the best short stories I have ever read in my life. It has such a strong atmosphere, so unique and eerie. This could easily be an episode of an anthology series on Netflix (yes I am thinking about Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities). There is just a different thing here, a sense of weird and uncanny. It reminded me of Cabinet of Curiosities, of Poe’s short stories, of Lovecraftian horror. It’s just incredible. There is a clear sense of beginning middle and end that just leaves you breathless and floored after you finish. It does feature some DA elements. I just loved this one so much. I am going to be thinking about this one for a long, long time. »Phobos - Tori Bovalino, 5 stars 💫 dark academiaWhile I was reading this anthology I kept asking myself, will there be a story featuring secret societies? Phobos was the answer to that question. This story was amazing from beginning to end. Frenetic, ruthless, competitive, ambitious, it was dripping with everything DA is. It was one hell of a story and I loved it.»Playing - Phoebe Wynne, 5 stars 💫dark academiaThis was amazing. There is excellent characterization here, we get to unpeel the layers of the main character little by little, and the more we discover, the darker it gets. This is just dripping with gothic atmosphere, it’s a treat. It also has everything a good DA needs. The story itself its very full circle too, and the ending is incredibly satisfying. I had a great time reading this one, it was perfect. As I said, the anthology in full gets a 4 star. For an anthology, this is one of the best, with more good stories than bad. I recommend it. Many thanks to Titan Books for providing me with an ARC in exchange for my honest opinion.↠ 4 stars✨
5715249456	A dark academia anthology that blends multiple genres into one quick satisfying read, with some strong stories, and others that fail to carry their weight. Given the vastly differing narrative styles there is something for any fan of the genre in here. 1000 Ships: Strong writing that instantly thrusts you into a dark atmosphere of toxic love and obsession, however with a conclusion that felt slightly lacking and failed to give the story a sense that it had gone anywhere narratively. Pythia: Dark and twist filled, this multimedia story managed to achieve an immersive and engaging narrative in such a small period. However, calling the story a dark academia is a bit of a stretch - but I’m not complaining.Sabbatical: A messy attempt at I don’t know what. This felt more like the apathetic detective at the start of a crime novel with a plot that jumped quickly between concepts allowing for no build of any sort of tension. The Hare and The Hound: Enjoyable blend of obsession with a ‘is it supernatural or not’ beat, that kept a strong degree of tension throughout. X house: Delightfully eerie and filled with surprising narrative twists, with an ending that was slightly rushed but still wonderfully shocking. The Ravages: This story failed at leaving an impact by lacking any sort of discretion by making the ‘twist’ of the story so blatantly obvious from the get go. Not to mention that it’s written with a detached sentimentality towards love and heartbreak, thus failing to provoke any emotional response.Four Funerals: A depressing sombre story that didn’t really go anywhere or feel as if the author had anything to say. The Unknowable Pleasures: Gloriously unhinged portrayal of a character descending into a madness sparked by an obsession with another couple's supposed relationship, with a rather open ended finish that felt gratifying. Weekend at Bertie’s: Sharp writing although the story didn’t seem to take many risks. The Professor of Ontography: A great build of suspense throughout, although the ending seemed more absurd than anything. Phobos: Perfectly paced and plotted with an instantly intoxicating dark atmosphere that made me long for a full length novel on The Order.Playing: Blatantly predictable with the only bright spark being the fact that the protagonist plays the organ which I never see in novels.
5864085331	"The problem was what it always is–power, betrayal, the carelessness of a man."With the exception of three stories, this anthology was riveting, beautifully written and thought-provoking. The three stories I hated were Sabbatical, Four Funerals and Playing (ranked from the worst to the least worst). These three stories were uninteresting, unimaginative, unoriginal, and ultimately lacking. They are the reason I can't give this anthology higher than four stars.Now on to the good stuff. The Professor of Ontography broke my heart. It was exceptional and devastated me in the best possible way. It absolutely fucked with my head too. This story was by far my favourite in the anthology, arguably my favourite short story I have ever read. It was absolutely incredible and I cannot sing Helen Grant's praises enough.Other good stories that stood out to me included: Pythia, The Hare and the Hound, The Unknowable Pleasures (the ending of which drove me insane), Weekend at Bertie's and Phobos. The unmentioned stories were also good but more forgettable than these.Overall, I loved this anthology and it really made me think, and it was so worth staying up until 2:23am to finish reading it.

5330767922	But was this really dark academia, is my question.
6379151139	Po genialnych tytułach, które można spokojnie zakwalifikować jako klasykę literatury Dark Academia (“Teatr Złoczyńców” oraz “Tajemna Historia”) rynek został zalany romansami i młodzieżówkami które w moim odczuciu raczej nieudolnie próbowały naśladować ten styl. Na szczęście wydawnictwo Insignis zdecydowało się na wydanie dwunastu niepublikowanych wcześniej opowiadań w zbiorze “W Tych Szacownych Murach,” (“In These Hallowed Hall”) na który czekałam już od dawna. Jeżeli kochacie mroczne historie, które dzieją się za murami gotyckich uniwersytetów, posiadającymi swoje tajemnicze bractwa oraz studentów, którzy nie raz posuwają się do niemoralnych występków to książka dla Was.Czym jest w ogóle styl Dark Academia i jaką estetyką się wyróżnia? Jak to się stało, że czytelnicy na całym świecie dosłownie oszaleli na punkcie tego nurtu?Dark Academia to ruch literacki i estetyczny, który pojawił się głównie na platformach mediów społecznościowych, takich jak Tumblr, Pinterest i Instagram, zyskując popularność wśród czytelników kochających ciemną stronę literatury klasycznej. Nurt skupia się na tematyce intelektualizmu, edukacji i fascynacji mrocznymi aspektami ludzkiej egzystencji, często czerpiąc inspirację z literatury gotyckiej, mitologii greckiej i dzieł takich autorów jak Edgar Allan Poe, Fiodor Dostojewski i Donna Tartt.Akcja książek utrzymanych w tej estetyce zwykle dzieje się w warunkach akademickich – mogą to być prestiżowe uniwersytety, gotyckie biblioteki, szkoły z internatem czy odizolowane akademiki. Idąc tym tokiem możecie się domyślać, że głównymi bohaterami tych historii są studenci, profesorowie czy też archiwiści lub bibliotekarze – osoby, które są wysoce inteligentne, lubują się w pięknie i sztuce ale również… Patrzą z góry na resztę społeczeństwa ukazując tym samym swój snobizm i elityzm.Historie w tym klimacie zawierają w sobie tak naprawdę wszystko to, czego współczesny miłośnik nieszablonowych, klasycznych a przede wszystkim mrocznych opowieści szuka. Znajdziemy tutaj tematy poruszające takie pojęcia jak śmierć, moralność, dylematy etyczne, poczucie winy a co za tym idzie konsekwencje swoich czynów, często przeradzające się w obłęd. Wszystko to jest spotęgowane niesamowicie klimatycznymi i estetycznymi opisami ubioru w stylu vintage, antyków oraz wspaniałych, monumentalnych budowli.Zachęceni? “W Tych Szacownych Murach” to zbiór opowiadań, który emanuje klimatami Dark Academia wciągając czytelnika swoimi niezwykle ciekawymi historiami. Znajdziemy w nim opowieści, które przyciągną odbiorcę nieszablonowym gotyckim klimatem, porażą historiami o zbrodni i dylematach moralnych a także zaciekawią tajemniczymi i przerażającymi studenckimi bractwami o wątpliwej etyczności.Opowiadania są utrzymane w spójnych klimatach choć jednocześnie znacznie się od siebie różnią, przez co każdy czytelnik znajdzie w nich coś dla siebie. Jak to zwykle w zbiorach bywa natkniemy się na takie historie, o których szybko zapomnimy jak i na te, które zapiszą się w naszym sercu już na zawsze. Muszę przyznać, że niektóre opowieści naprawdę magnetyzują swoim klimatem oraz oryginalnym pomysłem na fabułę i chciałabym podzielić się nimi z wami w kolejnym akapicie (oczywiście bez żadnych spoilerów!).Moim bezkonkurencyjnym faworytem jest opowiadanie “Profesor Ontografii,” które kupiło mnie pomysłem na przebieg wydarzeń i klimatem, idealnie wpasowującym się w artystyczny nurt turpizmu. Powiem szczerze, że historia którą stworzyła pisarka zdecydowanie zachęciła mnie do sięgnięcia po jej książki – wspaniałe pióro, umiejętność tworzenia nieszablonowej atmosfery i genialne wykorzystanie nieco już zapomnianych motywów gotyckich. Dodatkowo to opowiadanie może naprawdę was przestraszyć i zaszokować!Kolejnymi perełkami, które bazują głównie na zakazanej miłości czy wątpliwie moralnych romansach mających swoje konsekwencje są opowiadania “Tysiąc Okrętów” (Kate Weinberg) oraz “Nierozpoznawalne Rozkosze” (Susie Yang). Oba dziejące się w zamkniętych klimatach akademickich eksplorują zakazaną namiętność i toksyczne uczucie, które przeradza się w obsesję lub prowadzi do zemsty. Muszę przyznać, że oba wciągnęły mnie na tyle mocno (a szczególnie opowiadanie Susie Yang), że pozostawiły mnie z wielkim niedosytem – chętnie przeczytałabym całą książkę lub nawet obejrzała film pełnometrażowy, przedstawiający ciąg dalszy.Nie ma klimatów Dark Academia bez zbrodni, elityzmu oraz tajemniczych studenckich bractw, które ukazują brak kręgosłupa moralnego wśród studenckich elit. Idealnie obrazuje to opowiadanie “Fobos” (Tori Bolivano), opisujące krwawe i makabryczne próby, które musi przejść student aplikujący do jednego z tego typu organizacji…“Pies i Królik” (Kelly Andrew) to historia łącząca w sobie mroczne, akademickie klimaty z nutą fantastyki. Było to dla mnie coś zupełnie nowego, ponieważ niewiele jest książek utrzymanych w tej estetyce (a przynajmniej tak sądzę), które łączą w sobie elementy nadprzyrodzone. Muszę przyznać, że zagrało to… wybornie! Autorka zaczerpnęła inspirację z “Alicji w Krainie Czarów,” dodając szczyptę szaleństwa i poczucia winy, które doprowadza do szaleństwa. Było to zdecydowanie coś oryginalnego i niesamowicie wciągającego!“Okrutne Następstwa” (Layne Fargo) to kolejna opowieść o toksycznym uczuciu, które prowadzi do podłej zemsty. Wielbiciele nawiedzonych bibliotek i starej poezji będą w siódmym niebie!Mam nadzieję, że zachęciłam Was do sięgnięcia po niesamowity zbiór opowiadań jakim jest “W Tych Szacownych Murach.” Jeżeli jesteście fanami stylu Dark Academia lub nie znacie go ale czujecie, że możecie pokochać ten vibe szczerze polecam – będziecie usatysfakcjonowani i na pewno znajdziecie coś dla siebie.
7223113578	This was an extremely mixed bag, which is to be expected in an anthology of this sort. None were really outstanding. I am still figuring out what exactly Dark Academia is supposed to be. I liked the Vita Nostra books, which I have seen described as Dark Academia, but those are quite different. The stories in these (un)hallowed halls seem to be united only by an academic setting. For some it is central, for others it is incidental and the stories could as well have been placed elsewhere. They run from garden variety horror and homicide to verging on Jacobean revenge tragedy at its most gruesome. There is a good deal of the unhappy grad student/adjunct revenge fantasy floating around.I will pass over in silence those that I found meh and below. Some that I liked or that showed promise:M.L Rio, "Weekend at Bertie's" was clever with some interesting twists. I assume it is supposed to be a takeoff on Weekend at Bernie's, although not having seen it, that is lost on me. The characters are entertaining in their rampant amorality, suggesting that some of the least humane people to be found are faculty and grad students in the humanities. I liked Rio's writing, although her penchant for bizarre and jarring metaphors is sometimes off-putting. Probably the best story of the lot. Certainly the only one from which I jotted down any good quotes:"But they were too much alike to like each other much-the resemblance was unflattering.""Those depressing academic events where the only incentive to attend was free food." (I've been to way too many of those myself; at least many of them included alcohol as well as food)Helen Grant's "Professor of Ontography" really built up the tension, although I had pretty much guessed where it was going midway through. The Oxford setting was well done, and in view of some of the more quirky colleges, entirely believable. A good story.Tori Bovalino's "Phobos" is a tale of secret societies. This has been done plenty of times before, from the old movie "The Brotherhood of the Bell" to Leigh Bardugo's Alex Stern novels. Still a good story with interesting characters and a surprise at the end.Most of the stories are dedicated to the triumph of amorality in the academy, but lack the panache of Tom Sharpe.

I have previously enjoyed books by Olivie Blake, Kelly Andrew, and Tori Bovalino, and have M. L. Rio on my TBR. Literally nobody disappoints in this anthology, and was an deeply dark and exciting way for me to discover new authors that I want to read more of.This anthology captures dark academia in all its glory with twelve stories from twelve extremely competent authors.1000 Ships — Kate Weinberg★★★★★This anthology starts off extremely strong with 1000 Ships which is a short exploration of an affair between a student and a professor. There was a malevolent air to the story due to the toxic dynamic and the retributive nature of the main character, Lorna. This is also a prequel to Weinberg’s novel, The Truants, which I now immediately must have.Pythia — Olivie Blake★★★★In true Olivie Blake style, I found this one slightly difficult to wrap my head around but it was philosophically poignant in its prose as expected. I love how Blake explores the collective experience of being human with a clinical psychologist treating a super computer. This one acts as a social commentary combining science and magic to show how easily traumatic information can now be accessed and how it contributes to an anxious society.Sabbatical — James Tate Hill★★★★ ¼I thought this one had great writing and even more great main character, Tate. Tate is legally blind with what seems like only partially and blurred vision available. I found the plot interesting and I was intrigued to know that this also acts a prequel to Hill’s novel: Academy Gothic. But what I found the most fascinating is the way the other characters interacted with the blind MC and the unconscious ableism that consistently appeared, with Tate’s wonderfully almost-sarcastic and non-confrontational responses. I’d read the sequel for Tate alone.The Hare and The Hound — Kelly Andrew★★★★★Wow. This one packed a lot into its short lifespan. I adored the Norse mythological element which contributed some sorrowful magical realism to the story which features an accidental killer and a white rabbit, all whilst Kelly Andrew sniffs through the burrows of these characters, digging out their secrets from their little warrens.X House — J. T. Ellison★★★★★This one I found really powerful, particularly the ending. X House features a new professor coming in to teach a select and strange group of teenage girls. I agree with the author that teenage girls are super scary (having been one myself) and loved how Ellison explores a nasty female clique of schoolgirls with darkness at its core in a tense storyline.The Ravaged — Layne Fargo★★★★★I think this is my favourite, simply because I love a revenge story. Set within a deeply gothic archive full of notable artefacts, the LGBT main character in this story switches getting wronged by her girlfriend, to getting even. Perhaps her revenge plot was a little excessive in reality but in the deep dark world of dark academia, it was just right.Four Funerals — David Bell★★★★★This short story I think was the most hard hitting. It involved a school shooting and the professor of the class that was shot at visits the four funerals of the students who tragically died. Which is difficult when most people blame the professor for grooming the shooter. Four Funerals was incredibly immersive and I didn’t want it to end.The Unknowable Pleasures — Susie Yang★★★★This was a hypnotic story of obsession, secrets, and forbidden longing, but not from the perspective I expected. The main character in this story was as invested in the romance between Laurence and their professor, Elliot, in the same way that I’m invested in my cup of tea in the morning: an essential need to consume.Weekend at Bertie’s — M. L. Rio★★★★ ½A creepy and malicious take on Weekend at Bernie’s with two reckless characters who hate each other discovering their employer is dead and plotting to bleed her dry. Er, her bank account that is. The Professor of Ontography — Helen Grant★★★★★Easily the creepiest story out of the bunch! I was wholly haunted by this story because there is such a strong sense of foreboding from one locked door that I couldn’t stop myself from shuddering every time the main character went near it! This started off as a love story and devolved steadily into horror, set, of course, in a university.Phobos — Tori Bovalino★★★★★Well, it does not get any more dark academia than this. A secret order at university wants their five initiates to kill somebody “lesser” in order to cement their place in the order. Playing — Phoebe Wynne★★★★★An awkward, strange, and musical student main character, Grace, with a strong sense of narcissism, enjoys the opportunities deriving from playing the organ at so… many… funerals.A worthy anthology full of revenge, murder, dusty books, gothic school buildings, stormy nights, the unexplainable, rivals and recluses, secret orders, professors and students that aren’t what they seem, affairs, and mysteries galore.I feel like all these stories will haunt me in these hallowed halls of my mind.—Kayleigh🤍♡Booksta♡Twitter♡Threads
5782113772	Dark academia is back! What a wonderful anthology from some of my favourite authors. I really enjoyed seeing how each contributor put their own spin on the genre— from horror to secret societies, grief and obsession, each story was unique and a stand-alone display of talent and storytelling. My favourites were Kelly Andrew’s take on a whimsical and feverish horror-romance, Tori Bovalino’s vicious secret society and Helen Grant’s twisty thriller about a reclusive university department and the horrors it’s concealing. Like any anthology, not all were to my taste but overall if you’re a fan of dark academia this is a great taster of the genre and a perfect example of some stellar author’s short form work!
5166590519	dnf @ 14%from what i’ve read and heard, this is not dark academia at all. i had to force myself to read what i did and i was very disappointed. not worth the read if you want spooky, dark academia fall vibes. maybe i’ll give this another try in the future, but it’s very unlikely and i’m honestly proud of myself for making it as far as i did.
5740511861	i enjoyed some of these & not so much the others .. and then considering it’s an anthology, a collection of short stories, i couldn’t really get invested in a lot of these. overall, it was something i got through pretty quickly, with little investment (especially enjoyed the hare & the hound though)
7531833601	I was so excited for this because give me anything dark academia related. But this collection just didn’t do it for me. I found myself so bored and not really reading anything new or fresh. There was one story I did enjoy but in general this collection was a miss for me.

8053497092	Only a couple of stories I would classify as dark academia. Not all of them would be. But there were some good stories in here.
5174464446	1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg: Interesting story but very forgettable. I wish we had a bit more on the murder/suicide, because I felt like it didn't add much to the story. I was not a big fan of the writing style, but I found the main character very interesting. 3 starsPythia by Olivie Blake: I liked this one, even though I have trouble reconciling science fiction and Dark Academia. The story was compelling with a satisfying ending, but it lacked that Dark Academia vibe. 3.5 starsSabbatical by James Tate Hill: My least favourite without a doubt. The characters have completely unrealistic reactions and actions, especially towards the end. A story that makes little sense and a waste of time. 1 starThe Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew: One of my favourites. I loved how different themes were handled. The magical and horrific undertones were seamlessly incorporated into the story. The mystery was gripping and the writing magnificent. 5 starsX House by J.T. Ellison: I have to admit that even though the ending was a bit predictable, it was still shocking. This story works perfectly in this short story format which makes it even more brutal. The atmosphere and the tension were on point. I loved it. 4.5 starsThe Ravages by Layne Fargo: Another very good story. Despite the fact that I quickly understood how our main character was going to get revenge on her cheating girlfriend, I was still intrigued to see how far it would go and really enjoyed this story. 4.5 starsFour Funerals by David Bell: The story of this teacher going to the funerals of his four students killed in a school shooting was very insightful. Survivor's guilt is the main subject of this short story and while it provided barely any Dark Academia vibes, it was a very good story, nonetheless. 4.5 starsThe Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang: I must confess that I did not understand the purpose of this story. Maybe it was because I didn't feel concerned, but I didn't feel intrigued. There were some interesting discussions of obsession, but the ending seemed to make it all very pointless. 2 starsWeekend at Bertie’s by M.L. Rio: I loved the ambiance of this one. M.L. Rio's writing is still phenomenal and the story itself was interesting, but I still feel like I missed something by the end of the story. 4 starsThe Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant: Another one of my favourites. The tone is much more mysterious and darker than the others and can even be very disturbing at the end. But I loved it. The idea of a mysterious class that no one talks about was amazing from the start. The conclusion was very satisfying and the atmosphere perfect. 5 starsPhobos by Tori Bovalino: Another good one, with a feeling of uncertainty from beginning to end. The characters are compelling especially our main character, until the last page it is difficult to predict what she will do next. I saw the end coming, but it was still surprising. 4 starsPlaying by Phoebe Wynne: I was not a fan of this one. I like the whole idea, but the story itself was quite long and boring. I also had a lot of trouble connecting with the main character who I found very unlikable and not in a good way. 2.5 starsThank you so much to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review!
7919970573	If you like stories that take place in schools or are academic centered then this collection is a dream! I found that a majority of the stories were dark, creepy, and entertaining. My only issue is that this collection is labeled as ‘dark academia’ which is misleading. There are definitely stories included that can be considered dark academia while others just simply take place at colleges or are school focused.My favorite stories included:1000 ships by Kate WeinbergThe Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant ( this story was SO creepy!)

5726374698	I've loved dark academia as an aesthetic since the first moodboard I saw on Tumblr, but the actual execution of it in literature can be dodgy. Sometimes, novels that call themselves "dark academia" try too hard to be The Secret History, and sometimes they just ape the trends of the genre without any of the literary substance; ie, "this takes place at a boarding school, so it's dark academia". No, no. Luckily, "In These Hallowed Halls" as a short story collection has more hits than misses. Part of that is due to the care with which the authors were selected: ML Rio, Layne Fargo, Olivie Blake, and Phoebe Wynne are all greats in the genre who know what they're doing. Consequently, their stories linger longer than others - there's a good marriage there of aesthetic and substance. Some of the authors unfamiliar to me also did great work - I can't wait to read Susie Yang's White Ivy now that I've read her short story. As with any collection, some works just don't land. For the most part, though, this collection is a good representation of the 'dark academia' genre with a solid more-than-half of the selections being worth reading.
5166922587	14/20. Some of these authors have no idea what dark academia is. Some do! But some don't. Repeat after me: a story is not dark academia just because it involves school and has dark themes.Despite the genre confusion, Mostly the stories were solid with some stand-outs and a couple disappointments.
6433784329	Wyobraźcie sobie Wiktoriański pałac lub dworek. W nim bardzo dużo pokojów, a każdy z nich po przekroczeniu drzwi opowiada nam inną mroczną historię. Potraficie sobie wyobrazić, jakie byłyby te historie? Nie? To przychodzę do was z pomocą.Reklama Wydawnictwo Insignis12 różnych historii, różni autorzy i całkiem inne style pisania i to, co ich łączy to mrok, tajemnica i taka nie do końca dopowiedziana historia. Musimy sami dopowiedzieć sobie resztę lub wyobrazić to, co mogło się stać później, lub wcześniej.Ja przyznam, że pierwszy raz spotkałam się z aż tak różnorodnymi opowiadaniami w jednej antologii. Zazwyczaj kiedy myślę o opowiadaniach, widzę grupkę, podobnych do siebie osób, które piszą w podobnym stylu i o podobnych historiach, jednak nie tym razem. I przez to, że są aż tak różnorodne każdy znajdzie coś dla siebie.Ja odnalazłam kilka fajnych historii, które bardzo mnie zaciekawiły i chętnie przeczytałabym to w dłuższej formie np. opowiadanie „Pytia”, gdzie mamy taką nutkę mitologii i problemy ze sztuczną inteligencją. Moim ulubionym opowiadaniem zostało „pies i królik” - jest tutaj taka nutka magii i przepowiednia, która zmienia życie i bardzo chętnie przeczytałabym to w dłuższej formie jako taką historię pełnowymiarową, bo klimatem bardzo mi to przypomina „Alicja z krainie czarów”.Jednak jeśli mówimy o opowiadaniach, musi mieć też na uwadze to, że nie wszystkie opowiadania będę 10/10 i nas zachwycą. Przez to, że mamy to tyle różnych styli pisania, nie jesteśmy w stanie polubić ich wszystkich. U mnie było tak samo.Nie wszystkie opowiadania były takimi "moimi" opowiadaniami i nie do końca mi się czytało to dobrze. Miałam tak z początek książki, był taki dosyć oporny, bo te pierwsze dwa opowiadania nie do końca mi pasowały i nie wiedziałam, dokąd podążamy.Muszę też zwrócić uwagę na fakt, że opowiadania to taka krótka forma, żeby zachęcić nas np. do innych prac autora, w tej antologii wyszło to bardzo fajnie, bo dzięki temu chce poznać kilku autorów i ich dzieła np. Olivie Blake czy M.I.Rio.Moja Końcowa ocena to takie 4⭐️, bo było kilka słabszych opowiadań i kilka takich okej, a były też takie, które mnie po prostu zachwyciły. Bardzo chętnie przeczytałabym też coś takiego podobnego.
5588908470	thank you to titan for an advance copy for review!overall a really great short story collection focusing on dark academia - it was really interesting to see how that was interpreted differently in every story, though i would argue that some of these i wouldn't necessarily consider 'dark academia' - they were just tangentially sort of set in an academic setting? individual ratings below:1000 ships by kate weinberg: 3 starspythia by olivie blake: 4 starssabbatical by james tate hill: 3.5 starsthe hare and the hound by kelly andrews: 4.5 starsx house by jt ellison: 2 starsthe ravages by layne fargo: 4 starsfour funerals by david bell: 3.5 starsthe unknowable pleasures by susie yang: 4.5 starsweekend at bertie's by ml rio: 4 starsthe professor of ontography by helen grant: 5 starsphobos by tori bovalino: 5 starsplaying by phoebe wynne: 2 starsmy favourites were 'the professor of ontography' and 'phobos', but i also loved 'the hare and the hound' a lottttt. i will say however my one disappointment is that there was only one explicitly queer story in this whole anthology, which is kind of disappointing given dark academia is seen as some kind of "other" and i feel is the perfect setting for queer stories (i say 'explicit' because one of them could have been queer, but that was the whole mystery of the story. the only one with on-page rep was layne fargo's story.) also, not very diverse overall?
6450711225	☾ Rzadko, a prawie wcale sięgam po antologię. Jednak Dark Academia kusi i to bardzo, bo to taki vabe który można odczuć podczas lektury. Nie pozostało mi nic jak się w nią zagłębić.Aż dwanaście opowiadań w mrocznym klimacie i dwunastu autorów (na pewno niektórych znacie!). Tak mrocznej i przesyconej klimatem uniwersyteckim książki nie czytałam!Mistrzowie Dark Academia w jednej książce! To jak najbardziej możliwe i niebywale ekscytujące. ☾ Są opowiadania, które podobały mi się najbardziej i z kolei takie mniej przypadające do gustu. Jednak książka to nie zupa i nie każdemu każde opowiadanie się spodoba i to właśnie jest cała magia i tajemniczość tej pozycji. Każdy znajdzie coś dla siebie. Ale kiedy już pozwoliłam się poddać nurtowi tych opowieści…to nie mogłam się oderwać i nie raz mówiłam „ale już koniec?” Są porywające i to naprawdę. Z pewnością była to interesująca i zatrważająca przygoda w głąb gatunku Dark Academia. Pozwalająca poczuć się jakbyśmy sami byli w starym wiktoriańskim zamku czy uniwersytecie. Autorzy rozegrali to naprawdę dobrze i na każdym kroku odczuwałam cały mroczny klimat. Jeśli pojawia się tam wasz ulubiony autor to nie wachajcie się i czytajcie…bo warto.
5167150195	Rating for overall collection: 3.16 starsSometimes you just need a break from long, dense novels, and a short story fix. In These Hallowed Halls was a fantastic collection of twelve short stories that cover a range of genres, delving into mystery, horror, and even a touch of science fiction. While all are firmly academic in nature, some have a much more lighthearted approach, while others make your stomach churn. Because of the vast differences in writing styles and creative directions, I was never bored, even though certain stories were not to my liking. This is a great introduction to dark academia for those hesitant about the genre and will be delightful for those who are dedicated fans. Since these stories were incredibly short (most were less than thirty pages digitally) I will not be including detailed explanations of each story, but what I rated them.1. "1000 Ships" ⭐️⭐️2.

5900888119	really well edited and put together anthology! loved the pieces, i really enjoyed how they all brought something different to the table - i especially enjoyed the creepy ones.
5755186336	4/5 Before I go into reviewing each story I think it is important to discuss the genre of dark academia itself because it really has become such a muddled concept. To me, dark academia is many things, which can be at the authors discretion. Firstly, it can mean literally taking place at a college/university. Usually incorporating dark elements of life - that could mean stating the issues associated with academia itself and examining the flaws in the higher education system. Or that could mean dark occurrences occurred within that academic context. It can include elements of magic in there, or it doesn’t have to. To me, this is the basic framework of which dark academia rests, at least in my mind. Now a lot of these stories fit within this framework and some are outliers, in which case I say to each their own. What I really like about this short story anthology idea is that there is certainly something for everyone within its pages. Since dark academia can encompass many things, it contains lessons, dark overall stories, concerns about academia and power relations, murders, mystery, magic, etc. Which can make it easily enjoyable.1000 ships by Kaye WeinbergThis one details an affair between a professor and a student in which the professor is being investigated for the suicide of another student. Secrets are uncovered and it leads to a revenge plotline, which honestly I am all for. I really liked the sad reality of this one. What made it more suspenseful for me is knowing how competitive and tight-knit academic circles run, it made me question how many times this story could have and likely has occurred, minus the exaggerated elements of course. But that has the making of what dark academia is all about and I was thoroughly surprised but intrigued, definitely will check out the authors later novels following this premise.Pythia by Olivie BlakeHonestly this one felt less on the dark academia side of things and more on the science fiction side of mystery with a dash of university in there. I suppose we can combine the two even though it was difficult to reconcile in my mind when the science fiction aspect overpowered the academic. What I liked about this one was that it was certainly unique. I can’t imagine anyone else thinking to do this in an inquisitive narration sort of form. Stylistically speaking I thought that was very clever and the fact that there were two murders made it very eerie, I guess I wished that was the primary focus, rather than the computer part. I guess that stems from my lack of interest in AI. I suppose that the fear in this story is again that new aspect we see all over the media with AI and its implications and gradual preference over human talent and labour, while that’s always terrified me it has never scared me in a frightened way, if that makes sense. Overall I liked this story but I think it would have benefitted from more rapid suspense or a questionable ending.Sabbatical by James Tate HillThis one is my least favourite so far in all honesty, but the potential was there. The execution however: was not unfortunately. It felt more like the beginning of a crime novel than anything, but the rapid progression of plots with little substance meant the tension was not there, nor was the stakes high enough. It just felt random? Like the fact that random students just flung himself at him didn’t really add anything to the story overall honestly it just made me more confused. In a short story you need to be careful and conclusive about the elements that are being included and this fell flat for me in that regard.The Hare and the Hound by Kelly AndrewThis is probably my favourite thus far, it reminded me a bit of bunny by mona awad x the secret history. I think this was dark academia completely a match to the genre while maintaining impeccable suspense with a shroud of mystery and whimsy surrounding the circumstances of the plot. It can be very difficult to tackle magical realism with dark academia and even more difficult to incorporate all those elements within a short story that makes sense, but this one did that perfectly. The writing was so well done that I could literally feel myself flying through the story with ease and I was eager to see what would come next.X House bt J.T. EllisonI really liked this one, the suspense had me turning the pages in wanting to know what might happen next. I think this one really starts with a bang with the mystery and intrigue of it all - two suspicious deaths at a school in the middle of nowhere and a new teacher with another students pov? There’s so much potential in that and you’d think it’s hard to achieve within a short story but honestly I thought it was perfectly executed. THAT ENDING THOUGH? I want this to be a full story that would be so incredibly interesting. The Ravages by Layne FargoI LOVED THIS ONE SO MUCH!! I think it may be my favourite so far. I think it’s genius especially from a history students perspective and there is a certain accuracy about the reading of letters in modern day and making certain assessments about queer relationships, which is incredibly interesting to see brought to life in a story. It slightly reminded me of haunted mansion meets do revenge, which is pretty niche and I liked the ending a lot. I don’t want to say too much about this one because I do not want to give anything away, but suffice to say it was probably the one I flew through the quickest and it was a very fun spooky take on the dark academia genre with a little mystery x historical ghosts in there, which made it so much fun. I could seriously see this as a longer film/book in the future and either way I will be seated!Four Funerals by David BellHonestly this one didn’t feel like dark academia and more like a moral issue? The premise of this involves school shootings and an English professors role in it and it felt pretty off. I guess the point of the story was to emphasize survivors guilt? I don’t know how much I felt for the professor though so it was difficult to empathize with someone like that - to me the moral issue seems pretty clear cut. I don’t quite understand what the moral lowdown was supposed to be if there’s any positive takeaways from it. I guess this can be attributed to the larger darker subject matter, which could resemble real life, but I just don’t think this one resonated with me at all nor did I feel anything for the mc.The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie YangI am a little confused truthfully on how to rate this one. I think there is an interesting conversation about obsession in this one, but it’s muddled down by the too neat psychological ending. I think it would’ve been more impactful with a different ending, as it could’ve showcased the danger full circle. Even then the premise of this one was a little weird, which is to be expected in the dark academia genre, but I don’t think it landed for me nor did it present anything really meaningful. Weekend at Bertie’s by M.L RioM.L Rio has always impressed me with her ability to craft suspense and an eerie environment while contemplating the moral ethics of an act surrounding death. This one was interesting and very easy to get through, but the one drawback is that by the end of it I felt like there was something missing, a cryptic line, something more sinister or shocking would have been better in my opinion. Rio truly is a master of the genre, but I am not fully sure if I would myself classify this as dark academia though because that didn’t seem to be the proper backdrop or even have much relevance if i’m honest. Honestly I didn’t mind this one, but it was not my favourite truthfully.The Professor of Ontography by Helen GrantThis is easily one of my favourites in this anthology. It had mystery, horror, and the genre felt like dark academia without hesitation. This one was probably the most horrifying in my opinion and I loved the feeling of unease that it brought me cause honestly that was what I was hoping for. Yes it was predictable, but exactly how far the author would take it was what I wanted to know. It was also cool that it followed the character overtime and that all roads led back to the mystery at hand… and when you think of older schools with lots of history within then it really makes you ponder (at least it did for me)Phobos by Tori BovalinoI liked this one. Again, it was fairly predictable, but it really was a lesson on how far humans will go to feel like they belong, sprinkled with the potential for academic validation, which can make everything seem quite stark. This easily could’ve been a full length novel and honestly I hope that one day it is, cause you could really build up the more behind an Order like this one and with a whole supporting group (definitely getting ahead of myself here but it was THAT good), also the length of this short story within the title of “short story” was the perfect length, not too short, not too long, the descriptors were well-picturedPlaying by Phoebe WynneI liked this one, but truthfully I did not love it. The overall turn and ending of the story seemed very obvious to me and would have been better with more suspecting people questioning the occurrences that were happening. The fact that the character read certain books and eavesdropped all the time made it very obvious to me. But the bits about loving music felt cool and accurate, I feel like when you love playing an instrument it’s a way to calm down and feel at peace and the descriptions of that were interesting and authentic. Truthfully I think this story could have been longer with less obvious clues because it would have made the intrigue and suspense better rather than seemingly mindless descriptions of mundane activities.I went into this anthology a little weary, as I love dark academia and it is probably one of my favourite genres, but I was not completely sure about whether I would enjoy short stories. It can be difficult to connect to the characters when they’re only present for a short period of time. However, I have come to the conclusion that it works really well for dark academia. I think, truly, there is something for everyone in this anthology. This could be an incredible place to start if you want to get into the genre too as it exposes you to it directly in a palatable manner.
5794406683	**4,5/5**My favorite stories are:-Phobos by Tori Bovalino-The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant -X House by J.T. Ellison-Phytia by Olivie Blake
5769796335	In These Hallowed Halls really solidifies the 'dark' in dark academia. All the stories in this book are based in an academic setting and have those strange, intense, kind of spooky (and well, dark) vibes that I have come to associate with this genre. All of the stories in this anthology were pretty good, but if I had to choose my favourites, I would select M.L. Rio, Olivie Blake and Kelly Andrew's stories. Conceptually, I think they were my favourite in terms of the plot and the characters; each one of them started great and ended in a way that I felt was perfect, and at the same time left me wanting more.Honestly though, I would not mind if there was a volume 2 of this anthology with even more stories set in dark academia; because as someone who is in academia, we really need those. Thank you to Titan Books for providing me with an e-ARC via Netgalley!
5796106163	Dark Academia just always hits the spot for me so a whole anthology had me so excited to read it. Some stories were much better than others, some were complete duds for me. 1000 Ships by Katie Weinberg ⭐️⭐️⭐️ .✨- This was such a good way to kick off the anthology. Straight to the point, enjoyable and gave the perfect dark academia vibes. Pythia by Olivie Blake ⭐️⭐️⭐️ - I wish I liked this one more than I did. It was alright. Sabbatical by James Tate Hill ⭐️ - no..just no. The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.✨ - This was so damn creeeepy. X House by J.T Ellison ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - holy shit. This one had me just staring at the wall, sick when it was finished. Wow - genuinely sick and twisted. The Ravages by Layne Fargo ⭐️⭐️⭐️ - My love for Layne Fargo is the main reason I picked up this book but her story didn’t stand out as much as others. It was good and creepy though. Four Funerals by David Bell ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Loved this one, thought provoking and sadly relevant. The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang ⭐️⭐️ - The ending annoyed the actual crap out of me. What was that? What was the point? Maybe it all went over my head and I’m missing something…? Weekend at Bertie’s by ML Rio ⭐️ - Another one that left me feeling like, “um ok?” Also have no idea how this could possibly qualify as dark academia. The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - oooooh my GOD! This was INSANE in the best way. The build up, the execution, the ending. This was my favorite one by far. Phobos by Tori Bovalino ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - this one has Ninth House vibes. It was good! Playing by Phoebe Wynne ⭐️⭐️ - ehhhh this was a miss for me.

6778876885	4.5 stars! Overall, this anthology is exactly what I wanted and hoped for when I picked it up. I’m an absolute sucker for dark academia, and it delivers with panache. I was introduced to some authors that I will definitely be looking up and reading more of based on their contributions here!Because this is an anthology of short stories, I’m going to break it down:1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg - 4/5Great tone setter as the first instalment in the anthology. Very satisfying tale of revenge with an interesting heroine. Enjoyed it!Pythia by Olivie Blake - 5/5Could be my favourite of the anthology. Blake’s writing remains super stylized in a way that feels similar to her other work I’ve read, and so the characters and dialogue style feel a bit same-y, BUT, while this stylization was a turn off for me in other works, here it really shines. Twisty mystery with a magicky twist that’s captivating to follow.Sabbatical by James Tate Hill - 3.5/5The voice here is the story’s triumph. First person pov with an interesting protagonist of the sort I do really enjoy in dark academia: questionable, flawed, and not entirely lovable. There’s a lot of ick factor going on in this story; adultery, grimy atmosphere, horrible human beings, bitterness and resentment. It’s the aloof and almost detached POV of our protagonist that makes the unfolding of this plot captivating, and makes the ending satisfying.The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew - 5/5Yep, this one. Another contender for my favourite of the anthology. Damn I just love a good descent into madness. This story also features prophecy, norse folklore, witchcraft, and revenge: bullseye. X House by J.T. Ellison - 2/5This one was a miss for me. It felt like I saw exactly what the author was trying to do, and that’s the problem. I wasn’t drawn in, and the attempts at atmosphere, setting, character, and plot were all a bit too obvious to be really enjoyable. At the end I felt like “that’s it?” Maybe it would’ve worked better as a novel with more room to breathe.The Ravages by Layne Fargo - 3/5I enjoyed reading this one! Admittedly, though, I feel pretty neutral about it in hindsight. It’s memorable enough that I could tell you all about it, but in a plain sort of way that doesn’t evoke any emotion when I remember it.Four Funerals by David Bell - 4.5/5Oh man, this one was terrific. It feels completely unique in the collection, has more heart, and is more grounded and straightforward than the other romantically treated academia stories. It’s thoughtful, painful, and feels real. I’m keen to look up David Bell’s other work and read more.The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang - 3.5/5Ha, this one is a good chaser to David Bell’s heartbreaking story. It’s light, fun to read, and checks all the boxes of a satisfying story for the genre (except for murder/revenge, because as mentioned, this one is light). It’s got allusions aplenty, illicit romance, sexual deviance, obsession, and a sympathetic and relatable yet at times questionable heroine. Weekend at Bertie’s by M.L. Rio - 5/5Hello, this story is the reason I bought the anthology. I’m just hungry for literally anything M.L. Rio cares to feed me. The plot here is present, but clean and minimal. What carries this story and makes it sparkle is the two protagonists: their relationship with each other, full of tension and circumstantial co-dependence. It’s fascinating to follow them interacting with the setting, their circumstances, their big-picture. They feel real; they have a whole expanse of life outside the claustrophobic situation they find themselves in. Their inner lives are the story here, and yet there IS substantial action and development. While some of these stories are enjoyable in the moment of reading them but feel flat in hindsight, this story feels rich and more wonderful the more I dig into it. And as usual, M.L. Rio’s prose is a treat. God I can’t wait for her next novel.The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant - 4/5I was a page into this one when I stopped to look up the author. Her style of writing hit a sweet spot for me; I will definitely be reading her other work. This plot is a smidge predictable but no less enjoyable for it, and if I’m being honest, the ending still managed to shock me!Phobos by Tori Bovalino - 3.5/5This story feels like pretty classic fare for dark academia lovers. It’s the secret society story that the anthology would be incomplete without, and it hits all the notes you would expect of it. Enjoyable but not remarkable, though I did really feel the tension and suspense of not knowing how the Kill Or Be Killed question would be answered.Playing by Phoebe Wynne - 3/5This is the creepiest story of the bunch, for me! Simple yet carried off with successful style and ambiance. I will say, not the strongest ending to the anthology. Because I knew it was the final story, I felt a bit like I HAD to get through it. It was less captivating than others here.
5813794899	The concept of this anthology is, of course, immaculate, and perfect for fall. It's very on trend, very vibe-y, and it contains stories by some very popular authors. I think a lot of people would enjoy this, and I did as well, although, like with most anthologies, I enjoyed some stories more than others. Olivie Blake's story was my clear favourite and really stands out to me as the strongest in this anthology, which has me excited to read more of her work. Overall, I would say the first half of this anthology is the strongest, and my enjoyment fizzled out a little in the second half. Let me take you through each of the stories (spoiler-free!).Kate Weinberg - 1000 Ships 4/5In the author's note, the author explains that this is a prequel to their book The Truants, in which a group of students is obsessed with a literature professor. This prequel story follows this professor, Lorna, as a student herself. I thought this was a super engaging, intriguing story, and it was very well written. I haven't read The Truants, but based on this, I'd be interested in picking it up.Olivie Blake - Pythia 5/5I already knew I loved Olivie Blake's writing, but this was very different from what I've read from her before. In this story, she's given dark academia a scifi twist, written in the form of an interview transcript. And it was brilliant. It's about a supercomputer and the psychologist who worked with her, and throughout the story, we find out what happened to her. I would have never seen the twist coming, even though it had been set up perfectly, and I was blown away. This worked extremely well as a short story.James Tate Hill - Sabbatical 2/5This story was a bit of a flop for me, unfortunately. I didn't enjoy the writing style, which didn't draw me in emotionally. On top of that, the plot seemed very predictable, and the final twist wasn't surprising or intriguing to me.Kelly Andrew - The Hare and the Hound 4/5This story kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see everything unravel. I thought it had such an interesting concept, and I loved the ending for making me largely interpret things for myself.J.T. Ellison - X House 4/5This story is dual POV, which I thought was very interesting for a short story and worked really well. The writing is so so good, and I was intrigued by this story, but I also found it a touch too predictable.Layne Fargo - The Ravages 4/5This was undeniably well written, but at first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it very much. It started off very strong, but then my interest fizzled out a little. Then the story became a little creepy, which drew me back in again, and it ended up being really fun. It's also sapphic!David Bell - Four Funerals 3/5This story is about the trauma in the aftermath of a school shooting, and I find those very hard to read about, so this wasn't really the story for me. Putting that aside, I did think this was interesting.Susie Yang - The Unknowable Pleasures 2/5This story was just... extremely uninteresting to me. I kept waiting for it to get to the point but it never really did. I did think it was well written, but I wanted more from it.M.L. Rio - Weekend at Bertie's 2/5I was expecting this to be my favourite story in the anthology, but it really wasn't. It felt so void of emotion that I didn't feel invested at all, so I ended up caring very little about it.Helen Grant - The Professor of Ontography 2/5This was mostly just okay, and didn't feel as mysterious as it was trying to be. Then the ending felt weird in an absurdistic way, which didn't work for me at all. This just wasn't my kind of story.Tori Bovalino - Phobos 3/5I wasn't swayed by this story immediately, but the ending took an interesting turn. All in all it didn't do much for me, but I did like it more towards the end.Phoebe Wynne - Playing 2/5This just... didn't really pull me in. I didn't find myself very interested by it, even though the concept was intriguing. This is one of those stories that didn't work for me for no particular reason.
5362523709	In These Hallowed Halls I'm not normally a big fan of short stories since I take a bit longer to connect with characters and I like a more fleshed out plot. But this one intrigued me because it was dark academia and there were some pretty notable authors. I did find I had mixed opinions overall, with some stories being more enjoyable to me than others. It didn't fully give me the dark academia feel I was hoping for, but a few stories did fit the bill and I did end up really enjoying a handful! *possible spoilers1000 Ships - Kate Weinberg2.5/5: not my favourite, but I've never really liked cheating as a storyline and that was a big focus in this one. It also is a prequel to her full length novel The Truents, so maybe if I had read that I would feel more connected to Lorna. I didn't though and it felt a little unresolved. Pythia - Olivie Blake3/5: this was interesting and very Olivie coded, but it was a bit confusing at times. I did like the mixed narrative style of including interviews. It was a super interesting concept, but it did go a little over my head at times. Sabbatical - James Tate Hill3/5: I feel like there was a lot of story packed in this one, but it still felt like there was a start, middle, and end despite being so short. It wasn't my favourite writing in the whole world, but it captured my attention for the whole thing. The Hare and the Hound - Kelly Andrew4/5: this one was so good! It captivated me from start to finish and continuously left me wondering where the story was going. X House - JT Ellison3.5/5: I quite enjoyed this one. It was spooky in the way you can only get from teenage girls and felt like it was a longer read than it actually was because of how much was fit in. The dual POV was a bit interesting for a short story, so I feel like that took away a tiny bit since there wasn't enough time to fully get into the head of either character. The Ravages - Layne Fargo3/5: another story focused on cheating which is a bit disappointing since I really don't enjoy that trope at all. This one at least is more of a revenge story on a cheating partner, so I liked that focus more than 1000 Ships where the cheating was front and center. I enjoyed the writing, but the story itself just wasn't for me. Four Funerals - David Bell??: I'm really not sure how to rate this one. It's focused on the aftermath of a school shooting, which is such a horrifying and prevalent issue in North America. So while the story was captivating and I liked the writing, the subject matter was not something I really enjoyed. The Unknowable Pleasures - Susie Yang3/5: I'm indifferent to this one. It was unsettling with how obsessed Sophie was with a relationship that wasn't her own and the author did a good job portraying that. But then the ending felt like a complete 180 and was so abrupt that I was really confused about the sudden change up out of nowhere. Weekend at Bertie's - ML Rio2/5: I don't know if this just went over my head, but I'm not really sure what the point of this story was so I found it didn't really engage me. The Professor of Ontography - Helen Grant3.5/5: super creepy and a really unsettling ending. I feel like it had me curious right from the start. Phobos - Tori Bovalino4.5/5: this was my favourite of the short stories. It was the one that felt the most like dark academia and it captivated me from start to finish. I was engrossed enough to not be trying to figure out what was going to happen, so it was a surprise for me how it ended. Playing - Phoebe Wynne3/5: this was fine, just a bit underwhelming. It felt a bit obvious where the story was going from the beginning which took away some of the overall enjoyment.
5437639687	1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg ⭐⭐⭐While finely and well told, I don't believe that this story was the right choice for the first story post the foreword by the editors. Early on I had certain expectations for the story to come full circle in a specific way, and when it didn't, I was left extremely disappointed. Mind you, I didn't need a specific ending, there were a couple different ways that the story could have been brought full circle but I won't list those here as there would be no way to avoid spoilers. There's also the fact that this short story - as stated in the author's note at the end - acts as a prequel to The Truants by the same author. There are ways that one can write a short story that takes place within the same story or even with the same characters as a series - or as this one is, a prequel, without relying on the reader to know anything about the main story, but this short story does not do that well enough. I felt as though I was missing something so when I came across the author's note it made sense, but sadly didn't clear anything up about the story itself. Pythia by Olivie Blake ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Out of all twelve of these stories, Blake's ranked among my absolute favorites. With a unique and honestly terrifying take on our future - whether near or far off - in regards to artificial intelligence and super computers, I enjoyed the easy back and forth snippets of unconventional dialogue and the main character's own recollection of events revolving around the sudden death of a girl, one suspiciously close to the disappearance of another. So many wonderful yet unnerving ideas filled the 30+ pages - from cults around technology, a type of magic that links both technology and magic together, making technology mimic humans. A few lines of binary, a few softly muttered spells would then complete such tasks. But the most horrifying element of Olivie Blake's story is the idea of being able to - in a way - resurrect a person's soul, and insert it into AI, much less more than one someone's soul. Blake's writing style oddly reminds me of Veronica Roth's in the Chosen Ones, which only made this more enjoyable to read. To wrap it all up, there was an unsettling undertone throughout and I felt uneasy the rest of the work day. Sabbatical by James Tate Hill ⭐Sadly, this story was incredibly boring (I kept stating so to my coworkers while reading even), that I found myself trying to hurry through the story and honestly I don't think I retained much of anything from my reading of this story. The Hare and The Hound by Kelly Andrews ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐I was pleasantly surprised by the execution of this story, and how the writing kept my attention and hoping that the stories to come would be just as good if not even somehow better for the rest of the anthology. While most of my thoughts contain many spoilers and I try to not spoil ARCs, I will say that I was so happy that my own theories that I began to have quite quickly after Arlen was introduced weren't just revealed as correct, but merely implied, suggested that I had been right through my reading and analysis of the story. I would love to see more to this story from Andrews in the future, maybe even in Arlen's point of view, and then picking up after the short story ended or even before. This story left me with so many questions and so many thoughts - and in the best way possible. X House by JT Ellison ⭐⭐This one was alright. I did find the idea of hazing so extreme that both a student and teacher ended up dead to be interesting though. I do wish that there had been more to this story than what almost felt like a "don't do drugs" PSA but for hazing. The Ravages by Layne Fargo ⭐So I genuinely remember nothing about this story. Four Funerals by David Bell ⭐⭐While the writing was fine, the topic didn't feel particularly dark academia. This is just something that can happen at any time, any school, for any reason, in any class. It happens frequently. If school shootings were more rare in the US then maybe I could consider the topic more dark academia. Otherwise it feels like it's just a dark real life topic. I also wasn't really a fan of the point of view it took, and there were too many things left unanswered and I really disliked our POV character. The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang ⭐⭐The writing was actually really good here but the story felt pointless. It didn't even feel specifically dark academia - though I suppose a mystery and an academic setting is really all that's needed for something to be considered. I think the only thing that really made this an interesting story was the main character's mental health and I wish there was actually more discussion about that, instead of the story ending the way it did. Weekend at Berties by ML Rio ⭐This is so distantly related to academia - with the murdered person being related to the characters academically, this was boring and odd. The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant ⭐⭐⭐Not really sure what to rate this one, as it did a particularly good job of scaring the living shit out of me and leaving me uneasy for the rest of the night - but in a different way than Pythia did. Though I'm not sure that is particularly a very strong compliment as I'm very easily scared and given nightmares, plus I still had Pythia's unease running through my veins at the time of reading. I will say the writing was excellent, but I also wish that the pacing had been different, not exactly faster or slower, just... different. Phobos by Tori Bovalino ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐One of my other favorites in this anthology, I found Phobos to be excellently written and felt like a true dark academic story! I really liked the discussions of class and privilege had in this story as it related to the main character, and felt that they were only "quick" due to the nature of it being a short story and I would absolutely love to see a full length novel, or even just a novella diving into the whole story before and during and after. I also really loved how she ended up committing her murder of a lower ranking student in the end, and god I could go on and on, and while I know most of these aren't linked to a bigger work I would just die for a full length novel or novella of this one, and I will repeat that until the day I die. (I also think this should have been swapped with Playing in order to close out the anthology) Playing by Phoebe Wynne ⭐⭐⭐⭐The plot twist of this one was great! And to be honest the plot twist is why I'm giving this story four stars. I really liked how the main character started to think about the funerals she played at, and even had moments that made it seem like she didn't know what she was doing (ha me trying super hard not to spoil), but in the end fully knew what she was doing, and someone else at the funerals seeming to catch on as well. A delightful story, though I feel like this should not have been the closer. With an interesting premise, and many big name authors in the genre, In These Hallowed Halls promises much, but sadly doesn't deliver on about half of it. I found only about three stories that were five stars, with the majority of the stories being three or less, mostly less and less frequently three. I really wish that they had been able to get the five star stories first, and then take them and go "we want the rest of the collection to match these vibes" even if it meant replacing some of the three and four star stories, because if I could get stories like Pythia, The Hare and The Hound, and Phobos for the entire anthology, I can sacrifice Playing and The Professor of Ontography. I will say that while this anthology was largely disappointing (I had extremely and possibly way too high of expectations for this collection) - I would love to see more anthologies in a similar vein. Anthologies about other trends in literature right now, maybe light academia, cottagecore, fairycore, etc. Basically I would love lighter stories but I could also accept a second volume of dark academia inspired stories, if we got more authors. While I loved that not a lot of these authors were well known, I would also love a second volume with other authors such as Leigh Bardugo (Ninth House), Mona Awad (Bunny), Dona Tartt (The Secret History, The Goldfinch), Antonia Angress (Sirens & Muses), even Daisy Alpert Florin (yes I did just write a review for her book My Last Innocent Year). Generally, the concept and premise was spectacular, the execution - not as much, but also not as badly as it could have gone.
6493344430	3.5/5 |16+ °~◇•~🍂☕️🥀🪓💀🪦🕯✒️🎼♟️Mrożące krew w żyłach, przerażające, brutalne i druzgocące. Opowiadania będące kwintesencją estetyki Dark Academia, zebrane w jedną przepięknie wydaną książkę.“Coś idealnego dla mnie” - pomyślałam i bez zastanowienia kupiłam.Jednak moje oczekiwania zostały zgaszone niczym niedopałek papierosa. Bardzo ciężko jest ocenić coś, co jest zbiorem opowiadań różnych autorów, lecz mogę powiedzieć jedno: klimat każdego z opowiadań był genialny.Mroczna, gotycka atmosfera uniwersytecka, wykładowcy literatury angielskiej (oraz ontografii…), studenci popijający kawę i whisky, pachnące czasem książki i krwawe zbrodnie. A to wszystko otoczone mglistą, ciężką i wręcz magiczną aurą. Jak to bywa ze zbiorami krótkich historii, niektóre spodobały mi się ogromnie a inne…mniej lub w ogóle. Niestety większa część opowiadań z tego zbioru zalicza się do tej drugiej grupy. Niektóre z nich były niczym otwarte na oścież drzwi w opuszczonym domu. Zbyt zawiłe a mimo to nierozwinięte, można rzec, że niedokończone. Ich zakończeń nie można było nazwać nawet otwartymi gdyż zbyt wiele wątków zostało pozostawionych bez odpowiedzi.Do grona historii, które mnie nie porwały ani nie urzekły należą między innymi: “Tysiąc Okrętów” (które jest wprowadzeniem do książki co jest dosyć słabym zagraniem, a do tego wywołało we mnie niesmak)“Urlop Naukowy” (zdecydowanie najgorsze ze wszystkich)“Okrutne Następstwa” (brakowało mi tego…czegoś)“Niepoznawalne Rozkosze” (na sto procent nie byłam target audience)Spora ilość opowiadań zawartych w zbiorze “W Tych Szacownych Murach” obracała się wokół różnorako rozumianego pożądania, tematyki śmierci i uniwersytetów, mimo tego jednak nie poczułam ani trochę monotonii.Są jednak takie historie, które wciągnęły, poruszyły lub zbulwersowały mnie do żywego:“Pies i Królik” (psychodeliczne, mroczne i spływające krwią)“Dom X” (szokujące pod każdym względem)“Weekend u Bertie” (M.L. Rio powoli podbija moje serce)“Profesor Ontografii” (jedno wielkie WTF)“Grając” (co to było do cholery…)Podsumowując: Największe skrzypce grał tutaj klimat, a ja się na tę przynętę złapałam.Co mogę powiedzieć - uwielbiam wszystko co obraca się wokół tematyki Dark Academia, literatury klasycznej, sztuki i…morderstw czy tajnych stowarzyszeń.
5750446782	A college building does not dark academia make. Dark academia necessitates an obsession, or at least a fascination with the pursuit of knowledge in and of itself, not just the main character being a professor or a student. Dark academia might be a genre born from an aesthetic made up on tumblr in the last decade so maybe I shouldnt take it seriously but if we are using it as a legitimate term, let's use it correctly. And a good number of these stories don't qualify as dark academia under this pretty wide definition.That being said, in rating the individual stories I didn't take whether they're actually dark academia into consideration, as many would stories lose out on this.- 1000 Ships - Kate Weinberg - 3/5Not bad, but pretty banal. The heroine needed more self respect, I really couldn't sympathize with her.- Pythia - Olivie Blake - 4.5/5Great writing and a fascinating subject, loved the subsequent reveals, the ending was a little fast paced but the story gave me hope this anthology will get better as I go on.- Sabbatical - James Tate Hill - 1.5/5This gets a two because I don't give ones. Actually, let's make it a one and a half. If you write a self insert (the main character literally has your name!) and then go on about him dating a hot coworker, it should at least have some plot relevance. The story was very disjointed and overall pointless.- The Hare and the Hound - Kelly Andrew - 5/5Ooh check check check. This is a great one. Enjoyed the resolution a lot.- X House - J.T. Ellison - 3.5/5Interesting set up, had potential, but ultimately makes no sense to me. A little too much, a little too little?- The Ravages - Layne Fargo - 3/5Predictable and overexplained.- Four Funerals - David Bell - 4/5Well written. Heavy topic.- The Unknowable Pleasures - Susie Yang - 4.5/5This is a great one, very relevant, I was actually surprised to see the direction it went in but when I realized what was being said I fell in love with the story. The ending actually disappointed me, it felt so anticlimactic! I understand why it had to be this way for the text to send its message but on the other hand, this is supposed to be a dark academia anthology.- Weekend at Bertie's - M.L. Rio - 4/5A nice look into imperfect people's thoughts and ideas in an uncommon situation.- The Professor of Ontography - Helen Grant - 3/5A good story, but the writing just couldn't keep me interested.- Phobos - Tori Bovalino - 4/5This was *so good*, then I was disappointed, then the last page saved it.- Playing - Phoebe Wynne - 4.5/5A very strong ending to the anthology!Average rating: 3.7, so 4 stars.
5895070595	I rated the stories individually so I could do the math afterwards, ending up with a 3.5 that I will graciously round up to a 4 because it had good bones with a few under-cooked pieces that brought the average down.This was a great read though. The authors interpreted the term “dark academia” loosely, resulting in a storybook of dim, dusty libraries but also scenic landscapes outside of the classroom. There was a balanced blend of spooky supernatural and passionate murder mystery, so no two were the same. Some drag on more than others but ultimately, a good batch.1000 ships - 3/5Cheeky way to kick off the volume of stories. I’m here for it.Pythia - 5/5I usually don’t like this author’s style (Olivie Blake) but this had so much depth and torment that I was super intrigued by the format (line of questioning) and the open-endedness.Sabbatical - 1/5This was disappointing.The Hare and the Hound - 3.9/5Predictable but still enjoyable. X House - 2/5Wtf?? I’m angry because this could’ve gone so many different ways and it goes that way???The Ravages - 3/5Revenge plot, cute and spooky, a bit dramatic though lol.Four Funerals - 5/5This really stood out as the most sober and somber of the bunch, for a good reason. Academia and dark for sure, but more focus on the humanity of it all. The Unknowable Pleasures - 3ish/5Was really going somewhere until it didn’t and that was frustrating. I’m sure some will call it poetic justice but idc idc.Weekend at Bertie’s - 4/5, bc well-writtenWell-written, a bit crass, still don’t know what the point truly was.Professor of ontography - 5/5SO CREEPY. Phobos - 4/5This could’ve been a full series honestly (go watch ARES on Netflix for the same vibe).Playing - 5I love how this one unfolds.
5879508989	♡ Thank you so much Netgalley for the arc of the book ♡ ♡ ♡ In these hallowed halls, es un libro que recopila 12 historias cortas con vibes de Dark Academia, cada una toca un tema diferente y hay algunas más fuertes que otras y por supuesto unas mejores que otras, de igual manera al ser mi primer acercamiento al género fue un libro bastante interesante de leer. ♡ Tengo que admitir que de las 12 historias, solamente creo que 4 valen la pena, hay un par que tenían potencial, pero al ser precisamente cuentos cortos no lo llegan a explorar con la profundidad necesaria y hay otras historias que si no me gustaron para nada (pero ya hablaremos de cada historia más abajo) ♡♡♡ 1000 Ships by Kate Weinberg: El primer cuento nos relata la relación de una estudiante con su profesor, el cual está involucrado con la muerte de una estudiante y el cual es bastante creepy; La verdad la historia me pareció interesante en una primera instancia, también creo que de todas es la más corta y la que más rápido se lee, ahora, después de leer las demás historias esta queda bastante corta y poco interesante comparada con las demás. 2.5 ✰✰♡ Pythia by Olivie Blake: Una de las historias que si vale la pena leer, escrita por la autora de The six of atlas, desde el principio es una trama que te atrapa, la historia comienza con una entrevista a un profesor de una universidad que está siendo investigado por la muerte de una estudiante, también tenemos una supercomputadora la cual oculta un misterio y es una especie de (dios) para esta universidad. Tengo que confesar que entender la historia es un poco difícil, pero una vez le tomas el ritmo, 10/10. 4 ✰✰✰✰♡ Sabbatical by James Tate Hill: De mis menos favoritas; La historia trata de un profesor que trata de descubrir que le sucedió a otro profesor que se fue de sabático y que al parecer tenía bastante enemigos. Aburrida y el final no me termino de convencer. 1 ✰♡ The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew: MI HISTORIA FAVORITA DE TODO EL LIBRO, 10/10 en todos los sentidos; Este cuento nos narra la historia de ''Bunny'' un chico que en su infancia recibe una profecía la cual se empieza a hacer realidad en la universidad, tenemos misterio, plot twists, un final que me encanto y un poco de mitología nórdica. 5 ✰✰✰✰✰♡♡ X House by J.T. Ellison: De las historias que tenían potencial, buena trama, bien escrita, pero al ser un cuento no se termina de desarrollar completamente y se siente apresurada; Esta historia nos lleva a un internado de solo mujeres de alta sociedad, donde nuestra protagonista entra a remplazar a una profesora que murió misteriosamente y donde sus estudiantes no son tan inocentes como aparentan. 3 ✰✰✰♡ The Ravages by Layne Fargo: Otra de las historias que también vale la pena leer, es de las menos fuertes en el libro, pero no por eso deja de ser interesante; En esta acompañamos a nuestra protagonista que busca vengarse de la infidelidad de su novia en una noche de sección espiritual. 4 ✰✰✰✰♡♡ Four Funerals by David Bell: Otra de mis menos favoritas, básicamente nos relata la historia de un profesor que va a 4 funerales de sus estudiantes que murieron en un tiroteo y por el cual él se siente culpable, no trata el tema del tiroteo con el debido respeto y la historia tampoco es interesante. 1 ✰ ♡ The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang: Tampoco me gusto, una trama aburrida y un final más aburrido aún; Esta historia básicamente nos cuenta la historia de una chica (con varios problemas de obsesión), que precisamente se obsesiona con la idea de que su profesor y un alumno están viviendo un romance clandestino. 1 ✰ ♡ Weekend at Bertie’s by M.L. Rio: Tampoco me gusto, la escritura es buena para hacerte leer, pero es de esas historias donde no pasa absolutamente nada; Básicamente la trama es, dos estudiantes encuentran a su profesora muerta y en vez de llamar a la policía (como cualquier persona normal lo haría), deciden robarle la fortuna a la doña, that's it. 1 ✰ ♡ The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant: MI SEGUNDA HISTORIA FAVORITA, después de leer 3 historias seguidas bastante decepcionantes, estaba perdiendo la fe de encontrar otra joyita, pero lo hice, dios mío que trama, qué final, que plot twist; Este cuento nos presenta a su protagonista Phoebe que en los 80's vive un evento bastante traumático cuando su novio desaparece en la universidad frente a sus ojos y todo el post trauma que esto conlleva, de verdad que me encantaría leer un libro completo de esta historia. 4 ✰ ✰ ✰ ✰[image error] ♡ ♡ Phobos by Tori Bovalino: Una sociedad secreta y un sacrificio final para ser parte de la misma, es otra de las historias que es buena, pero que al ser un cuento se siente apresurado y que le falta desarrollo, el final me dejo más preguntas que respuestas; sin embargo, estuvo interesante la trama. 3 ✰ ✰ ✰ ♡Playing by Phoebe Wynne: No la mejor historia para terminar la colección de cuentos y es que tampoco me gusto, la protagonista es una organista en una iglesia donde sus feligreses siguen falleciendo y donde claramente hay más allá que simplemente ''una muerte natural''. Deteste a la protagonista que se cree la última coca-cola del desierto y que claramente ''no es como las otras chicas'', también el plot twist es bastante obvio y eso le quita emoción al final. 2 ✰ ✰ ♡En conclusión, In these hallowed halls, es un libro con varias historias aburridas y predecibles, pero con 4 joyitas que hicieron que valiera la pena leerlo. 3 ✰ ✰ ✰ en total.
6026944917	i was looking forward to reading this for a bit and my feelings are definitely mixed. i think my biggest problem with the anthology is that about half of them i wouldn't consider "dark academia". the problem with sub genres is usually vagueness in the classification and this anthology proved that to me. some of the stories simply just... took place at a college/university and had little else to do with the genre. also some of the stories left little mystery and i felt the twists were stated so early and easily i didn't necessarily want to keep reading. still, enjoyed it over all. short stories always feel so comfy! would not recommend all of them but.. stand out stories i'd recommend:Pythia- Olivie Blake Phobos- Tori Bovalino Weekend at Bertie's- M.L. RioThe Professor of Ontography- Helen Grant

6399744468	3.5 Tak jest bezpiecznie, bo opowiadań jest sporo i są bardzo różne od siebie, bardzo skontrastowane. Jedne przypadly mi bardziej, a drugie mniej i w niektórych ciężko było poczuć tego obiecanego ducha dark akademii. Na pewno Pytia od O.Blake to moja ulubiona historia, natomiast więcej spodziewałam się po M.L.Rio na przykład, może została za daleko umieszczona i za dużo już wymagałam, także tu bywało różnie. Zaimponowalo mi za to pióro autorów i autorek, których nie znałam, a to na wielki plus, bo zawsze fajnie odkryć coś nowego. Ogólnie mega pomysł, całokształt książki oceniam pozytywnie
6921115209	Some short stories were so cool, others were way out there. This anthology reminded me why I don't enjoy short stories: when I enjoy one, I feel short-changed lolFave stories: The Hare and The Hound (story around a shapeshifter following a student around), The Ravages (sapphic revenge story), Four Funerals (interesting commentary on a teacher surviving a school mass shooting. 4 students to mourn, and the guilt of having pushed the shooter student to enhance the violence on a paper he was writing about a mass shooting), The Unknowable Pleasures (a college student becomes obsessed over her teacher's relationship with one of her peers).3.5 stars
5174490997	3.75/ 5 ✨Thank you to netgalley and titanbooks for this arc in exchange for an honest review. From great, soaring buildings resembling cathedrals to hidden prophecies, the creaking of floorboards, the crunch of leaves beneath your shoes, to hidden mysteries and secret societies the tropes of dark academia are many and vast. While some stories form around elements of fantasy and others about the mundane, everyday aspects brought to life in stunning color this anthology really does have it all: betrayal, love, cracked spines of books, monsters and foreboding fog all included.As a lover and avid reader of the dark academia novel I was so excited to pick this up. Featuring some of my favorite authors and others new to me, I found myself in shock and awe at so many of these darkly-weaved tales. Dark academia is truly the perfect genre for autumn, and with cold, foggy days slowly approaching, this book is the perfect anthology to curl into on a cold, rainy night. This is my first anthology, and I found it difficult to rate as I adored many of the stories but found a few fell flat for me. This was a wonderful way to find new authors and revisit new works from authors I have grown to love. My favorite stories were: Pythia: I loved the mix of fantasy and dark academia she always puts in her novels. She creates such inviting new worlds that are filled with magic & the escapism is perfect. Such a refreshing, original story that still carries all of the traits of dark academia we have grown to love.The hare and the hound: if you loved the novel Bunny by Mona Awad this is the short story for you. Rabbits, shapeshifting and dark magic? Do I need to say more? The vibes were perfect: Gray, stormy endless nights. An attention to detail that was impeccable. I can’t wait to read more of this authors work. The professor of ontography: This one gave Edgar Allan Poe vibes and I gasped out loud. Vivid, creepy and perfect. Phobos: This one was the perfect embodiment of dark academia. A secret society, a series of rituals.

5682200711	I don’t think this anthology was for me. I also hated that it ended on a really low note. That last story was not good at all. The ones I liked were The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew, The Ravages by Layne Fargo (my personal favourite), and the Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant. I really hated The Unknowable Pleasures by Susie Yang and I feel like I wasted my time reading it. I don’t think I’ll be reading any more anthologies in the future. Smell review: 5/5 it smelled really good at least
6330464249	1.5 stars because I did not like some of the stories, and a few were pretty good. DNF @ 41% It has taken me three days (March 26-29, 2024) to read five stories (out of 12). One story was a mesh of interviews and prose, which was basically a word salad!"That's the crux of it, if you think about it." WTF does that mean? That sentence doesn't advance the narrative, it just adds to the word count.Two of them were quite good, but the most interesting one ended horribly and brutally.Unlike other reviewers, I am not picking at whether or not this anthology hits the mark of 'dark academia". Too many of the stories felt to sci-fi or fantastic for me.
5793152100	4.5This would’ve been 5 stars if not for the last story, which I just couldn’t get into.This anthology meant a lot to me, as it is my first time reading fiction from m. l. Rio since if we were villains, and I was anxious. I was frightened i would despise her new works but, gladly, I did not! Olivies story was amazing, as all her works are, and I even discovered some new authors, which I’ll be looking into buying books from soon!
5167309016	A good anthology that I breezed through. Some stories were really great, some were okay, and others I weren't entirely sure were even Dark Academia really. Ratings for each story below, with an average of 3,5/5 stars that I'm rounding up. 1000 Ships - 3/5 Pythia - 5/5Sabbatical - 2/5The Hare and the Hound - 4/5X House - 2/5The Ravages - 4/5Four Funerals - 2/5The Unknowable Pleasures - 4/5Weekend at Bertie's - 3/5The Professor of Ontography - 5/5Phobos - 4/5Playing - 4/5
5253778159	This book was just proof that I like dark academia stories. I enjoyed all of them up to some point, I'd say the stories range between 3.5-5 stars each. Definitely an enjoyable read, if you can call it that, considering the content.As for my favs, I'd name:- The Professor of Ontography by Helen Grant- X House by J.T. Ellison- The Hare and the Hound by Kelly Andrew
5733398781	j’ai adoré l’ambiance, les différences entre claques histoires mes préférées étaient probablement thé Hare and the Hound, The Unknowable Pleasures et Weekend at Bertie’spar contre, 4 étoiles parce que certaines histoires je les aurais plus classées comme mystérieuse que dark academia mais bon…… une anthologie bien sympa !
5166816907	I went into this book with absolutely zero expectations—I set my bar very, very low. Colour me pleasantly surprised to see that every story in this dark academia short story collection had an actual plot! And a conclusion! And moreover, there wasn't a single story that was *bad* either!You must understand, I'm a Tartt purist (with some exceptions). But I genuinely enjoyed this anthology. The stories all brought a creative and pertinent perspective to the dark academia sub-genre. Yes, even M.L. Rio's. Definitely recommend "In These Hallowed Halls" if you never got over "Babel" or "The Secret History".
5860214704	3.5 ⭐️
6924879651	This would have been 5 stars but I did not enjoy all of the stories. Being able to dive into these short little delicious dark academia treats was wonderful. I thought they were all well done for the 30ish pages each one was given. I will 100% be revisiting some of them to reread.
5967768830	3.75⭐️były tutaj naprawdę dobre opowiadania które mi się ogromnie podobały jak „pies i królik” „fobos” lub „pytia” ale były też takie które tak bardzo nie wiedziałam co robią w tym zbiorze, że zabawnie przez to taka ocena ale ogólnie podobało mi się
6030145776	The deepest, darkest dives into the corruption in modern academia, and I absolutely. Ate. It. Up.
7185530583	3.5czytanie tego teraz bylo mi bardzo nie na reke ALE niektore opowiadania byly fajne. za calosc 3.5 bo 3 opowiadan nie dokonczylam a w reszcie nie do konca odpowiadal mi jezyk.
7543454466	Incredibly compelling, reminiscent of “The Secret History”
