3285179596	Welcome to the next chapter for November’s killing, heart pounding, brand new journey!This is action packed, thrilling, mostly interesting sequel, starting from November’s hometown continues in Europe and finalizes at the lion’s den: fighting against brutal and the most powerful, skilled assassins, manipulative evil genius strategists. It’s all about finding the missing father before their enemies get him and learning the ugly truth about her family history. The second installment turned into Mission Impossible waltz with Bourne Identity series with a little Kingsman series vibes without charm of Taron Egerton (nothing could be juicy and intriguing with this Scorpio actor’s sizzling charm!) Action packed parts were moving and gripping but I slowly start to lose my interest, especially the romantic involvement between November and Ash was the weakest element of the book in my opinion. At the first book: I got intrigued with Hogswart meets House Night vibes that Academy Absconditi presented us and of course it was fun to read November’s discovering her qualifications and her secret family mystery. But I think second book mostly lost its charm and the sacred secrets November gotta find out were not crucially captivating enough to drag me down from my comfort zone and bedazzle my mind with its enchantment. It’s still fast, riveting, entertaining reading even though I didn’t like most of the characters and I lost my interest about the plot. It’s still promising and good read for genre’s fans but I thought the first book was only a warming up tour for our real crazy train ride journey and when I start the heart throbbing journey, I realized I didn’t get satisfied enough about the cause and motivation of the characters. I’m giving 3.25 stars. The author is still talented and she still knows how to pick the interest of the readers but I think I expected more about the story’s progression and I didn’t like this book as much as I liked the first installment.So many thanks to NetGalley and Random House/Knopf Books for Young Readers for sharing this action packed and interesting ARC in exchange my honest review.
3908004201	Well I enjoyed the first book a whole lot more, but this was still fun!There were quite a few times where I found my mind wandering in this only to be dragged back in an intense and exciting action scene. Still, the teen drama levels dialled up quite a bit in this second installment which made it a less enjoyable experience for me. I did, however, find the ending action-packed and engaging. Overall a pretty good series.

3522207499	This sequel places some of the events of Killing November in a different light and brings it full circle. However, it feels odd. I was excited for November going to rescue her dad but this story was.... not what I expected.In November's search for her father, she goes on a scavenger hunt of sorts looking for clues he has hidden. While it's technically addressed in the story, I am nonetheless bothered by how these clues were geared towards Strategia like Ash rather than for November, particularly because how the clues were hidden was aimed for her. I think it's a gamble for her father to have taken the assumption that she would be assisted by a Strategia. It's a fair assumption to make because otherwise she would not have made it, but... what if she hadn't? Some things that took me out of the story was how the adults, who did not know November or Ash, were so willing to cooperate with them. November and Ash were very suspicious. They kind of stumbled their way, even if it did take them deciphering the clues. One of the biggest things that bothered me was the many long memories. Some were relevant to the clues, which was fine, but some weren't. Usually, they dragged on for a bit. While it informs us about November's childhood, it does it in a way that feels disconnected from her current mission. It felt different than in Killing November.Despite there being some deaths and threats, it felt more like an adventure story? The stakes were higher but surprisingly, it didn't feel that way consistently. There was a lot of light-hearted moments surprisingly. There's also a heist. The gang gets back together. I saw the major twist at the end coming. I normally wouldn't mind this if the journey had felt fulfilling and interesting but I just didn't care.
5685129670	While I didn't think this was quite as strong as a standalone book as the first book in this duology, I think overall this was a really good entry and a really satisfying ending to the overall story arc. I also enjoyed the acknowledgement of the fact that the main characters are still kids; sometimes that gets lost in these YA books with big plot conceits. It was a nice layer to add into things
2969460116	Rating: 4.5 StarsNovember scarcely survived the Academy, but now she must embark on a mission to find her father. Will November find him in time, or will they both meet their end?Killing November was a rock solid hit for me, and I couldn't wait to get back into this world. The sequel was just as jam packed with rapid fire action as its predecessor, but it also took me deeper into the world of the Strategia. I had previously learned a bit about these families, but now I found myself fully immersed in their world. As the plot thickened, November found herself taking a deep dive into it all, and I became more and more engrossed by the ways of the Strategia. I devoured every morsel of information Mather fed me about them, and loved trying to put it all together. In the last book, I saw November honing her skills. Here, I watched as she used her skills to accomplish an important mission. It was interesting seeing her and her companions in a "real" world setting, which was filled with many close calls and heart pounding moments. Speaking of her companions, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the developments with respect to November's allies. Some were very unexpected, while others stepped up in big ways. It was fantastic seeing them all come together to fight for a common cause. There were some really HUGE reveals towards the end, and even an actual gasp worthy moment. Seriously, I gasped aloud as I read this one part. It was fantastic! Sequels are always hard to review, because you never want to reveal too much. What I will say is that I loved getting to know November and the rest of the families on a different level, and this book kept me captivated from beginning to end. I am sort of sad this series turned out to only be a duet, because I feel like November has more stories to tell, but I am extremely happy with the ending Mather gave her.

2909506963	Honestly, I'm a little disappointed with the follow up to Killing November. I really loved that book, and this one was just OK for me. I kept putting it down and picking something up, so much so, that it took me 2 weeks to finish it, which is really unlike me.I think that the fact I read Killing November over a year ago (and had a hard time remembering a lot) definitely impacted how I felt about it.I still like Adriana Mather's writing and stories, and will still read whatever she writes, but this one was a bit of a disappointment.
3242367074	Oh my word....I just finished and honestly can’t stop my head from spinning. This book wasn’t just good, my heart is still racing, the suspense was INTENSE! For 3/4 of the book, I literally had my heart in my throat, at the edge of my seat, praying that these literary friends of mine were going to figure out how to get themselves out of one mess after the other. This book was a roller coaster of feeling. Adriana’s writing had me anxious the entire book and then, BAM! My very favorite Aarya comes on scene with her dry humor zingers and I can’t stop laughing LOL I cried through this book, laughed at Arya’s dry wit and at Nova’s adorable goofy humor, screamed at the characters as if they could hear me..... honestly, this was just such a good GOOD read that I know I will be recommending it to people left and right. The characters are well written and the story line will keep you at the edge of your seat, with just a splash of romance thrown in that keeps you rooting for the leads! Well done, Adriana! I can’t wait for whatever new adventure you have cooking up in your brain!
4847131293	yes yeS YESASH i love him. he was so perfect. AAREYA AND INES AND LAYLA AND MATTEO AND LITERALLY ALL THE SIDE CHARACTERS WERE *CHEFS KISS*november i liked more than the other book, but she still had her annoying moments. and the plot was good but i liked the plot better in the first book. however, the ending here was perfect!!!!!with that being said, i think this duology could’ve used a third book because i would like to know how these characters are doing afterwards, maybe even an epilogue could’ve been nice.also, there were a lot of flashbacks that didn’t mean anything and kind of took away from the book for me. to top it all off, emily was kind of an unnecessary side plot.
4063447838	3,75 ⭐️ Voici l’extrait d’un passage que j’ai particulièrement aimé :« Chercher la perfection est un piège. C’est se condamner à être toujours déçu. Même les meilleurs d’entre nous ont des failles. Leur force, c’est de les connaître, et de ne jamais se surestimer. Se comprendre soi-même, voilà le véritable pouvoir. »

6674083959	݁.⊹₊ ✶ ˚. hunting november .˚ ✶₊ ⊹ . ݁⟡ ⊹ · ˚ * . ⟡ * * ⋆ .· ⋆ ˚ ˚ ˚ * ⋆ · * ⟡ · ⟡ ·₊⊹ ·₊⊹ spoiler free reviewˏˋ°•*⁀➷ This book was 100% better than the first. I LOVED it. It started out so so good, usually sequels are annoying to start because they have that awkward cringe recap stage, but this book didn’t. I loved that so much, it actually just started nearly exactly where the first left off, so it was super fast paced and easy. And ahhhhhh the romance. INCREDIBLE. I loved it so much. Usually in the thriller/mystery genre if there is any romance at all it's like two maybe three cute scenes, which is totally fine and great. But this book delivered so so so many cute moments, omg I was thrilled. I liked Ash and November in the first, but I adored them in this sequel. ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ The mystery plot was also super engaging, and bingable. I really liked the setting(s?), they went to so many different places, the writing was perfectly descriptive, and the imagery was amazing. It kept those cozy castle medieval spooky vibes from the first, even though they were not at the academy. I really like the pacing as well, the only thing I could say was maybe the ending went a little fast. We lacked a little insight into her father’s reasoning, but maybe that’s just because I was literally falling asleep while I was reading and I was binging so fast. I was so desperate to finish it was so good, but I was no joke falling asleep. It could be a me problem. 🤭ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Ok more on Ash and November. They may be a new comfort couple for me. Ash was the most cutie pie, protective, hard shell with a softie center, perfect, amazing person. He literally worshiped the ground November walked on. He was down bad, and I was so down bad for them as a couple 😭💗. Now this occurred to me while I was reading and I audibly screeched so I must share. I was trying to come up with a ship name and it hit me. Ashember. ASH EMBER. Do you see it?! Ember as in the coals of a fire, and Ash as in the remains of a fire?? Made for each other, no words. I marked so many quotes from them, and it wasn’t even all of them. They had the most adorable moments like at the very least every 50 pages, which again is so rare for a thriller. It was like this book was written with my perfect amount of romance. One of the cutest things was how the first time November held Ash’s hand he was surprised (cause ya know he’s not used to physical affection or affection of any kind😭) and then he melted completely into it, pulling her closer to his side. Not only that but after she did that Ash started reaching for her ALL THE TIME. Precious. ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ I did really miss Layla in this one. She was so sweet in the first and her and November were just becoming friends, but at the same time it was so cute to see Ash and November’s dynamic without her there. She made a few appearances in this one, but I do wish we got to see November and her bond a bit more. I just missed her 🥺. ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Overall I actually adored this book, I want to re-read it already. I am so happy this hit for me, so many books have been lacking this year. This one is so not included in that list, literally ADORED. I was giggling and kicking my feet so much. I was in a state of pure joy the entire time my eyes were on these pages. I already miss it so much, I was not ready for this to end. ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Here are a few of my fav quotes, I know it's a ton. There were just so many perfectly quotable moments and this isn't even all of them. 😭💗Some were just wayyy too long to type…⟡ “‘Nailed it on the comforting.’ A small smirk appears on Ash’s face. ‘I’ll comfort you when I’m certain we're not going to die.’ In spite of myself I laugh. ‘That's literally the worst thing you could have…Haven't you heard of telling someone their outfit looks good when it doesn't? White lies save lies.’ ‘Your outfit looks good,’ he replies, playfulness dancing in his eyes. I look down at my rumpled uniform, which consists of a white button-down, black leggings and black lace up boots. ‘It does, doesn't it?’ I say. ‘I could win a pirate costume contest in this thing.’ Ash’s mouth pulls up into a smile, but his expression seems more than amused. He’s looking at me like I’m the most unusual and interesting person he’s ever seen.” ⟡ “Ash smiles at me. ‘I can't leave you alone for two minutes. Good thing I don't intend to.’ Layla raises her eyebrows. ‘Are you flirting right now? That could have turned into a fight.’” ⟡ “‘You really are beautiful,’ he says, and chuckles to himself. ‘I never thought I would say that to a girl with a very sparkly phone case. But it couldn't be more true.’” ⟡ “But instead of answering, he walks right up to me. His look gains intensity and my stomach does a quick flip. He touches a loose lock of my wavy hair and places my arms around his neck. He pulls me close. ‘If you could see yourself the way I see you, you would know that you’re perfect,’ he says with fresh minty breath and it suddenly occurs to me I haven't engaged in any of my morning grooming regime. He leans closer, and just as he nears my mouth I turn, give him a fast kiss on the cheek, and step away. ‘No way I'm kissing you while you're all freshly showered and’ - I gesture at him - ‘dressed like that.’ He laughs. ‘You won't kiss me because of my clothes? Is there an outfit you would prefer? Because I'll gladly change.’” ⟡ “Why do you think I came with you November?” “Why?” “Yes, why would I leave my twin sister, my training at the Academy, and risk my life to be here with you?” “Um, well you want to stop the Lions, for starters.” “Not the reason I’m looking for.” “You enjoy a good risk?” “I'm falling for you November. I realize that might sound trivial to you. I saw those pictures in your room, listened to your stories. And I am certain that you've been surrounded by people who care about you your entire life. But it's new to me. Caring about someone other than my Family wasn't encouraged; in fact it was actively discouraged. You asked me why I decided to come on this mission with you. You listed all the reasons I shouldn't. That is why. The truth. Because being without you felt like a greater sacrifice than all the rest.” ⟡ “I think the charcoal is helping but I swear I'm never drinking whiskey again.” “Noted.” “I’ll make sure there’s none of it served at our wedding.” “Our wedding? Oh god. Please tell me I didn’t say what I think I said.” “I’ll admit, I always thought that when a girl finally proposed to me, it would be better choreographed than that. But at the time, I think you may have been a two-foot-tall seal. And it was pretty romantic for a seal.” “This is so not funny.” “Oh I beg to differ. That definitely makes my top three best conversations of all time.” ⟡ “I slip my hand into his non-bandaged one, mostly because I want to remember walking down this jaw-dropping street with him, but also so I don't walk into anything while I'm craning my neck. For just an instant, he tenses, and I realize that holding hands probably isn't a Strategia thing. I remember how aggressively Layla reacted the first time I stopped her in the hallway by grabbing her arm. She almost leveled me on the spot. But a half second later, Ash relaxes and his fingers curl around mine, pulling me close to his side.”
5475425766	✨10/10✨November serisinin ikinci kitabı November’ı Avlamak da bitti! Serinin son kitabıydı. Bu kadar güzel bir kurgu onlarca kitap yazılabilirdi ama yazar iki kitap yapıp zirvede bırakmış. Gereksiz uzatmamış ve tam yerinde mükemmel bir sonla bitirmiş. Yazarı gerçekten tebrik ederim! 😍🥳Okurken çok keyif aldım. Kitabın içindeki gizemin peşinden giderken meraktan ölecektim. Elimden bir an bırakamadım. Kesinlikle bir akademide geçen, cinayetlerin ve sırların olduğu aksiyon dolu bir hikaye okumak isterseniz gözünüz kapalı alın. Kitabı okurken aksiyon dolu bir film izliyormuşum hissi vardı. Karakterler, anlatım dili, hepsi harikaydı. Reading Slump’tan çıkaracak kitaplar listesine de girer. Okumanızı tavsiye ederim.
5498098482	✰ 3 stars ✰ “It’s a form of power to be able to embrace yourself in all the ways you are and all the ways you’re not.” Chasing Christopher would have been a more beneficial and correct title than Hunting November for the sequel that I had held off from reading for so long, only to be severely disappointed. Like, what happened?? Where were the thrills, the intense tension, insanely vivid action, and high stake scenarios that intrigued me to continue? Where was November's clever wit and intense flair for danger that made her such a unique heroine??? I have never felt so deflated and disgruntled before, it was so so sad what happened here - a YA duology that had the potential to be something I could rec to others that you won't regret reading this, made me regret reading it. And that's the worst feeling ever. 😞“It’s almost unbelievable to me that only a month ago I had no idea this bizarre boarding school even existed, that Strategia were real. And despite dodging death a half dozen times and being framed for murder, my troubles are only just beginning because my dad is now being hunted by an assassin-like secret society of Families that is so effective it’s influenced the course of history for thousands of years.”I did appreciate that we got a lot more backstory to the history of the Strategia and how the power system works, especially how November's parents legacies was such a centerpiece to the entire system. While I didn't enjoy how much of the story relied on November rehashing her past to find out the truth behind her past, I admired November's fierce determination in finding and rescuing her father. traipsing over two continents, following the intricate clues laid out by her father, heading into dangerous territories to get closer to him. It did seem a little far-fetched at times, but, hey - to suspend disbelief works like a charm sometimes! 😀😀“To you I would have been a commoner.”Ash shakes his head. “I think you’re absolutely wrong, November Adley. I would have known you were perfect anywhere I met you.”“Perfect?” I say. “Okay, now I know you’re full of it. The last thing I am is perfect.”“Perfect for me,” he says with such intensity in his expression that I think I might melt into the floor.Ash and November were very cute together - the moments of their soft love shared was such a warm levity in contrast to the tense atmosphere they were involved in. 💕 I also enjoyed seeing some of the main side characters from the previous book return - who were once sworn enemies, were now on the same page, fighting by each other's side, with one purpose - to upend the most powerful family in all of Strategia. How they balanced each other out - compared notes, challenged each other, often at times, not trusting the other, but still finding a way out of difficult situations - it was a refreshing change since when they were hurtling knives and throwing punches at each other. 😊😊“Just because there isn’t a clear shot doesn’t mean you can’t win. There is always a work-around and a way to surprise your opponent. It just takes creativity and a lack of self-imposed boundaries.”Sadly, I didn't feel the writing was as polished and intriguing as before - there was plenty of action and danger afoot, but none of it compelled me to be at the edge of my seat or pulling my hair in fear. It was lax of feeling - almost to the point of being lackluster in appeal. The ending, especially, was just so weak - the threat nor the conclusion didn't feel palpable or even rewarding. 😟 In fact, it was almost laughable at how easily it was resolved, despite the whirlwind of danger circling November and her team. Or maybe it's just me - I was so hopeful that it would live up to expectations that once it started off so poorly, it completely dampened my enjoyment. Which just saddens me and frustrates me - I don't regret giving it a chance - I regret that it wasn't what I thought it could have been. 😔
3618481705	le lloro fuerte, te amo Ash, te amo November. Diosito que buen libro, November no cambio mucho, es decir, lo esencial de ella que es lo que la diferencia de los estrategas no cambia y eso da un buen ambiente y Ash, el literalmente trata de ser mejor persona por November, finalmente permitiéndose amar.
3778708996	L’ambiance est toujours aussi cool mais j’ai quand même eu plus de mal à accrocher ...
3938028631	C’était meilleur que le premier tome, mais tout va toujours trop vite, pas de développement des personnages et de certaines situations comme si tout était acquis.
4894407154	3 Stars ★ ★ ★ Well... this book was a big miss for me. I found myself bored and fast reading through some of the filler parts as I just didn't seem to care about most of the characters. I would have liked it more if it was just Nova and Ash on the hunt to find her father, but all the other characters just confused me and made it too much for just a basic hunt-and-find story. The first book is way better and can easily stand alone without this second book. I made some notes, but none of them are worthy of sharing, it's all very generic YA romance.Sorry, Adrianna-I love all of your books except this one.
3960597150	Un second tome lourd en rebondissements. Je ne me suis pas ennuyée une seule fois durant ma lecture ; j’étais tellement immergée dans l’univers que j’ai lu l’intégralité en moins de 48h...
5062988878	Not as good as the first one, and it got a little slow at parts, but it was still an amazing read!
5282560216	3.5⭐️
4188721121	3.5/5⭐I don't know what else to say to convince y’all to READ this duology!I think objectively this would be three stars, but I don't care. The ending BLEW my mind and I SOBBED. The author really played with my feelings. Aarya, Ines, Ash, November, Layla, and Matteo truly are some of my new favorite characters... THEM. ASH IS ATTRACTIVE AF Edit (a month later): Ash just came into my mind 😩Am I mad some of my favorite ships didn't happen? Yes. I'm actually super mad but at the same time, I'm so happy by the way some things turned out...and SAD because the author DID NOT have to do that. RTC
2923121962	Another action packed story. Loved this book so much. Where first book is at the academy this all over and it’s daunting. Im not sure it’s me but trying figure who is good and who isn’t still a challenge but that makes the lure of the story. Plus all the kick butt characters. Very strong but passionate female MC. To ash very awesome side character. Soo if haven’t read any of Adriana’s work should do so. 5/5 stars for me.
5293730385	i loved this book. it was everything I wanted in one book.the ratio between the mystery and the love and comedy was just perfect. The dynamic between nova and ash reminds me so much of pip and ravi. i love the way the story isn’t hard to follow even when there’s a lot going on ! aarya is also hilarious LMFAO i love her. this was a nice read ! thanks again awa for the recommendation 🫶🏾
3087694089	4.5 Stars'Hunting November' is the second book in a thrilling young adult series that readers are sure to love. After reading and loving the first book, I had pretty high expectations and hopes going into this one. I'm happy to report that I wasn't disappointed in the least. Everything that I loved about the first installment carried over into this book. November was an awesome main character. She's realistic and I easily identified with her right from the beginning of the first book, so when I read this one, it felt like I was meeting up with an old friend. She continues to be smart, strong, determined, and generally badass. She has her flaws like everyone else and we get to see both sides of her, which made her feel all the more realistic. I loved getting to know her even better in this book.The plot was intriguing and full of twists and turns, secrets and lies, and lots of thrills. I loved how the story had us solving clues and chasing the answers down all over the world. Figuring out the clues was a lot of fun for me and I loved piecing it all together. Although the plot wasn't wholly original (which is basically true for any book these days), the author put a lot of thought and uniqueness into it to make it stand apart from anything else out there. The last thing I want to talk about is the writing style. It always plays a huge part for me and can make or break a book. The author wrote the story in the first person point of view from November's perspective. The first person is by far my favorite writing style because it allows the reader to have a deeper connection with the narrator. I love that the author chose to tell the story from November's POV because it felt like I was right there alongside her throughout everything that happens and I liked getting to know her character even better than I had before. Overall, this was a fantastic book and a wonderful second installment in a thrilling young adult series. Highly recommended for fans of the genre and readers who enjoy the author's other works.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
3093957780	Hunting November is all you would want and more in a sequel to a kick ass first book (Killing November)!! Hunting November doesnt skip a beat!! You're immediately consumed in Novembers world as if you were November yourself. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time (with major anxiety at times lol). This book is so unpredictable and right when you have it figured out Adriana Mather surprises you!! Phenomenal isn't a good enough word to use for how amazing this book truly is. It will definitely have you wanting more. I feel my review does no justice to this fantastic, amazing, perfect, book! If you're on the fence of buying this book; just do it!! Lol you wont regret it!!(:
5463146267	Ağağaağağ😍😍😍 her anı çoook güzeldi!BAYILDIM!❤️İlk kitabı da favorilerime girmişti ama bu kitap çook daha güzeldi! "Bana neden bu göreve seninle birlikte çıkmaya karar verdiğimi sordun. Gelmemem için bütün sebepleri sıraladın. İşte bu yüzden. Gerçek bu. Sensiz olmak, diğer her şeyden daha büyük bir fedakârlık gibi geldiğinden." İlk kitabın sonunda yaşananlar ve ortaya çıkanlardan sonra, November’ın akademiden ayrılacağını ve Ash’in de onu yalnız bırakmayacağını öğrenmiştik. Bu kitapta da November’ın Ash’le birlikte çıktığı bu macerayı, amaçlarına ulaşabilmeleri için atıldıkları tehlikeleri, çözmek zorunda kaldıkları sırları ve bulmacaları, bu süreçte kurdukları bağı ve onlara gelen sürpriz destekleri okuyoruz. Ash gülümsedi. "Seni iki dakika yalnız bırakmaya gelmiyor. İyi ki böyle bir niyetim yok." Ash ve November ilişkisinin gelişeceği gayet öngörülebilir olsa da aralarında bu kadar güzel bir ilişkinin olacağını, Ash’in bu kadar mükemmel bir karakter sergileyeceğini tahmin edememiştim. Ash, duygularını hiç saklamadan kendini November’a açtıkça, onu her an düşünen hareketleriyle, ona olan sevgisinin güzelliğiyle beni kendine aşık etti. Dahil olduğu her anı güzelleştirdi ve okudukça eriyip gitmemi sağladı😍 Seriye başlarken çok beklentiliydim ve bu beklentilerimin karşılanacağından da emindim, ama daha çok, ustaca işlenmiş akademi kurgusu, sırlar, kurnazlıklar, zekasına hayran bırakan karakterler bekliyordum. Yani romantizm anlamında çok fazla bir şey göreceğimizi düşünmemiştim ama beni bu açıdan da inanılmaz mutlu ettiğini söylemeliyim😍❤️ Benim için en büyük sürprizlerden biri Ash’e aşık olmak ve favori erkek karakterlerim arasına eklenmesiydi!🙃 Ash, "Sende dikkatimi çeken ilk özelliklerden biri de bu," dedi. "Mizah duygun."Çok şaşırarak, "Gerçekten mi?" diye sordum. "Akademi'deyken hep aşırı ciddiymişim gibi geliyordu. Benimle Pembrook'ta tanışmış olsaydın daha farklı olurdu. Ağlayana kadar gülmek tam benim kalemim olan bir şey. Ama orada tanışsaydık belki o zaman benden hoşlanmazdın." Kaşlarımı kaldırıp indirdim. "Sana göre sıradan biri olurdum."Ash başını iki yana salldı. "Bence çok yanılıyorsun, November Adley. Seninle nerede tanışırsam tanışayım, mükemmel olduğunu anlardım.""Mükemmel mi?" dedim. "Pekâlâ, işte şimdi saçmaladın. Her şey olabilirim de mükemmel çok zor"Öyle bir inançla, "Benim için mükemmelsin," dedi ki eriyip yere damlayacağım sandım. Bunun dışında, ilk kitaptan itibaren inanılmaz detaylı ve başarılı bir kurgu var. Her şey o kadar ince ince işlenmiş, gördüğümüz her şeyin kurgunun devamı için o kadar anlamı var ki😍 böyle ilmek ilmek işlenen ve her ilmeğin bir amaca hizmet ettiği kurgular beni çok mutlu ediyor. Gerçekten her anından inanılmaz bir keyif alarak okudum kitabı.❤️Ash ve November’ın birlikte verdikleri mücadeleyi okumak ne kadar keyifliyse, yardıma gelen karakterlerle kurdukları ekibin mücadelesini okumak da o kadar keyifliydi. Birlikte çok güçlü ve güzellerdi. Yazara kızdığım tek şey, sondaki o malum olaydı, böyle bir darbe alacağımızı tahmin ediyordum ama yine de keşke olmasaydı💔😢 "Bir keresinde bana gerçekten değer verdiğini söylemiştin," dedim. "Çoğu insan bunu söylerken duygularını kasteder, midesinde kelebekler uçuşturan duygularını yani. Ama sen bana gösterdin, sadece emsalsiz riskler alarak değil bana güven verip en umutsuz anlarımda bile beni güldürerek. Sana söylemek istediğim şey şu ki, ben de sana gerçekten değer veriyorum.""Bu iyi bir şey November çünkü ben sana âşık olduğumdan çok eminim," dedi. "Senin bunu umursamadığını şu an öğrensem çok kötü olabilirdi."Güldüm, yanaklarımı ateş basmıştı. Sırıtarak ve içten içe tekrar söylemesini umarak, "Şimdiye dek bir erkeğe söylediğim en romantik şeyi söyledim ama sen bir yolunu bulup yine beni alt ettin," dedim. Hınzır bir bakış attı. "O zaman sen izin verdiğin sürece seni hep senden daha fazla sevmek için var gücümle çabalayacağım. Bir insanın bir insanı benim seni sevdiğimden daha çok sevebileceğini hiç sanmıyorum. O yüzden lütfen bir dene. Ama yenilgiye hazırlıklı ol." İlk kitaptan itibaren aklımdaki tüm soru işaretleri cevaplarını gayet güzel bir şekilde buldu, o yüzden epey mutluyum. Kitabın her anını büyük bir heyecanla okudum ama son düzlükte nefesimi tutmuş bir haldeydim resmen! Ve sondaki ters köşe de okuduğum en iyi ters köşelerden biriydi. Beni her anlamda mutlu eden, oldukça yüksek beklentilerimi fazlasıyla karşılayan muhteşem bir seri oldu. Kurgusuyla, karakteriyle, anlatımıyla yazarı çok sevdim. Umarım daha fazla kitabını okuyabiliriz önümüzdeki dönemlerde. Size de gönül rahatlığıyla tavsiye ediyorum. Okumadığınız her an çok güzel bir şeyi kaçırıyorsunuz bence.❤️ "Bir şey önemli ise bunu hep anlamışımdır. Ve sen, November, nefes kesicisin. Bıçak kullanma becerilerinle herkesi alt ederken bir yandan da etrafına nezaket ve neşe saçıyorsun. Çevrendeki herkes sana saldırıp ihanet ederken bile insanlara güveniyor, içlerindeki iyiliğe inanıyorsun. Hayatım boyunca senin gibi biriyle karşılaşmadım, sana âşık olduğumu söylememek için yaşayan en ahmak insan olmam gerekirdi."
3235297781	Weirdly enough reading this book made me want to up my rating for Killing November. “Hunting November” takes us on an adventure through Europe as November and Ash try to unravel the secrets left behind by her father as they struggle to outmaneuver Jag and see end end to his reign of terror. So what I enjoyed in book 1 was that she was learning everything from poisons, fighting techniques and other skills to make herself a better Strategia and in this one it was less of that and more running around on a weird scavenger hunt and I thought it would focus more on the relationship ties between families but it fell back on the usual trope becoming something straight out of Borne Identity. I never felt the chemistry between Ash and November so that stuff I just glossed over waiting for the action to kick in and it’s a shame that the characters and plot lines that were the most interesting were kept on the sidelines and like November I wanted nothing more than to see the original tale of the Lion and the Bear because those two and their story was the only thing that kept me around so long. This isn’t a bad series but it is ultimately one you will forget. **special thanks to the publishers and netgalley for providing an arc in exchange for a fair and honest review**
3353191431	Somewhere in the world is a boarding school where the children of assassins are trained to take on their parent’s mantel. They’re sent to learn how to survive as the right hand of leaders, prevent mass genocide, and circumvent wars. They may not be known the world over, but the Strategia are the only thing keeping whole nations from crumbling.Hunting November follows… November (Yes!! That’s where the name comes from!) as she looks for her missing father. With the help of friends, she’ll travel from her home in the states all the way across the Atlantic to Europe in search of answers. And all along the way, she’ll have to uncover secrets, solve hidden clues from her dad, and try not to die by the hands of those out to stop her.This book was just as action packed as Killing November, but instead of being trapped within the walls of Academy Absconditi with the children of her family’s enemies, she’ll have the entire world at her throat… literally. I really enjoyed that even though we didn’t get the whole boarding school mystery vibe, which is what really gave the first book its charm, we get a world filled with puzzles, mysteries, and what could be death at every corner. So really anything could happen.I can’t say exactly what happened, but there is a shocking death that really hurt, tbh. I wasn’t expecting it, so of course it was a great move on the part of Adriana Mather. SHOCK ME! Keep me guessing! And now when I read her books, I’ll know not to trust her to keep my fave characters alive!
4187292650	Nachdem mir Killing November so gut gefallen hat, konnte ich Band Zwei kaum abwarten und auch der Abschluss der Dilogie konnte mich wieder absolut fesseln. War das spannend! Auch wenn ich das Internatssetting in dem Band ein wenig vermisst habe, so war es dennoch wieder wirklich schwer aus der Hand zu legen und ich habe es fast vollständig an einem Abend verschlungen. Da es sich um den zweiten und letzten Band handelt, möchte ich natürlich nichts zum Inhalt verraten. Die Geschichte ist eine Art Verfolgungs- und Schnitzeljagd und es hat viel Spaß gemacht die Protagonisten auf Ihrer Suche zu begleiten und dabei selbst mitzurätseln. Es herrscht eine geheimnisvolle und fast schon düstere Atmosphäre und die Handlung selbst war wieder sehr actionreich und voller Wendungen. Einzig allein zwischendurch habe ich manchmal ein wenig den roten Faden verloren und war ein wenig verwirrt von den Geschehnissen, was den Lesefluss ein bisschen gestört hat. Dennoch ein gelungener Abschluss, der mir ein paar spannende Lesesunden beschert hat. Wenn ihr die Reihe noch nicht kennt und Lust auf eine mysteriöse und spannende Geschichte zum miträtseln habt, dann solltet ihr euch die Bücher unbedingt mal genauer anschauen. Ein Jugendthriller, den ich definitiv empfehlen würde.
3184973086	For someone new to the world of Strategia, November has had a rapid introduction to the families and their machinations.After an action-packed introduction I wasn’t sure it was possible to ratchet up the tension. But Mather does, in spades.Forced to leave the Academy, Ash and November are on a desperate hunt for clues to find her dad. Their journey is fraught with danger, and I’m in awe of the skills these teens develop. This book makes the bigger picture clear and we learn a little more about the people in charge. Plenty of thrills, some awful moments to take in but we get a lot of optimism too. Ultimately, November comes out on top...but there’s a lot to get through before she arrives at this point.

3071171650	Killing November was one of my best reads last year - high stakes, untrustworthy characters, a school for assassins. The year waiting for this sequel was a long one.This book picks up right where the other left off. November and Ash leave the school in search of her father, who's left complex clues for her in different locations across the country. Talk about tense situations - death could literally be waiting for them around every corner, and some of the people they come across would just as soon slit their throats rather than speak to them. Pacing may leave you breathless, and the action is almost nonstop. But not everything is serious - some lighter, humorous moments are sprinkled throughout the story along with romantic elements. Twists and surprises abound, and the big reveal near the end left me gaping. I absolutely didn't see it coming. This series is incredibly addictive, with ultra-high stakes, a complex plot, and untrustworthy characters that worm their way into your heart. I get the feeling this is a duology, but I'd sure love another book. Highly recommended!I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.
3254292346	When I read the synopses of Hunting November, I didn't expect to like it. The insular world of the Academy was so appealing in Killing November that I couldn't imagine Hunting November without it. I was wrong. Mather has once again managed to create a world that the reader can inhabit. November has left the Academy with Ash, careening through the UK on a mission to find her father. Along the way she and Ash meet unlikely allies and encounter diabolical enemies. While the naivety and ignorance of November is again stretched to its limits as in Killing November, it is not as grating and frustrating in this second effort. Overall an enjoyable read, one that has stayed with me. Mather has an incredible skill with descriptive text, allowing the reader to be so deep into the book that scenes replay like a movie. when remembered. Thank you NetGalley for the ARC!
3306256738	I had the opportunity to read the ARC of this and I can say this was amazing! Ive been bawling for like 30 minutes now. This book had my emotions going on a roller-coaster! I loved every minute of it! Nova and "the gang" are some of the best characters I have ever read! I def hope we get more in the future. This was the easiest 5 star i have ever given!
3447042923	** spoiler alert ** I-I’m at a loss of words to describe my love for this series, I really really hope the author writes another one. Well she needs too. And Ash and November, my power couple, oh my babies, when he told her he would love, and one up her in love forever, my heart was so so happy, I was literally crying.
4087862666	Nota real: 4.25/5🌟Sinceramente no me esperaba que estos libros me gustaran tantísimo, ha sido una sorpresa que me ha encantado la verdad. Es una historia super novedosa, original y con una trama muy diferente; con un poquito de romance aunque no es para nada lo principal y muchos muchos secretos. En este libro lo especial de la personalidad de November ha seguido formando parte de ella, no ha cambiado, y eso me ha gustado mucho. Más que cambiar ha sido más bien ha sido al contrario, gracias a ella los demás personajes iban cambiando.Tiene una trama tan especial y original que me encantaría poder ver este mundo en la gran pantalla, o al menos en netflix jajaja creo realmente que triunfaría y es lo que la gente necesita y quiere ver ahora mismo.Mini-Spoiler del primer libro en este párrafo. Este libro comienza justo al día siguiente de donde lo dejó su predecesor y nos narra la aventura de November, acompañada por Ash, en la búsqueda de su padre antes de que lo encuentren sus enemigos y lo maten. Esta aventura está llena de acción, secretos, descubrimientos, peleas, asesinos, estrategas, disputas familiares, intriga...No voy a contaros mucho más de lo que ocurre en este libro porque yo soy de las que opinan que se disfruta más de un libro sin saber demasiado de qué trata. Yo ni si quiera me leí la sinopsis de "Cazar a November" antes de leerlo. Solo deciros que en este libro ya nos metemos de lleno en el mundo estrategia y la diferencia de familias, lo que hizo que lo entendiese todo muchísimo mejor y me atrapase esta forma de vida tan distinta. He disfrutado tanto de esta historia tan original que la segunda entrega me ha gustado incluso un poquito más que la primera. Es una lectura fascinante, súper ágil, atrapante y divertida incluso (a pesar de tratar de asesinos quiero decir). El final no sabía cómo iba a ser ni qué quería que pasase, pero para mí tuvo el final que se merecía y me dejo muy satisfecha. Ocurrió todo de la mejor forma posible y no se dejaron ningún cabo suelto. (A pesar de eso, si en algún momento deciden seguir tirando del hilo y sacar una tercera parte, estaré deseosa de leerlo). Me encantaría poder leer más libros ambientados en el mundillo que la autora ha creado en la Academia Absconditi. Lo echaré muchísimo de menos porque estos libros se han ganado un hueco en mi corazón.Pienso que es una bilogía que vas a disfrutar mucho si te gustan los libros con secretos, misterio y con un aire juvenil.

All opinions are my own.Book: Hunting NovemberAuthor: Adriana MatherBook Series: Killing November Book 2Rating: 3.5/5Publication Date: May 5, 2020Genre: YA ThrillerRecommended Age: 16+ (violence, secret societies, spy stuff, murder)Publisher: Knopf Books for Young ReadersPages: 368Amazon LinkSynopsis: Surviving a few weeks at the world's most lethal boarding school was one thing. But now comes the real test: Can November Adley find her missing father before her enemies find her? Subterfuge is the name of the game in this thrilling sequel to Killing November, from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of How to Hang a Witch.After surviving a crash course in espionage at the mysterious Academy Absconditi, November has only one purpose: finding her missing father. Along with fellow student (and heartthrob) Ash, November follows the clues that her father left, embarking on the deadliest treasure hunt of her life. The first clue is in her hometown, where old friends beckon and unexpected enemies lurk around every corner. The second clue is in Europe, where revelations about her family's history will plunge her into an international web of deception, lies, and intrigue. The third clue is deep in enemy territory, surrounded by the most skilled assassins and master strategists, and where everyone wants her and her father dead. Can one girl with limited training infiltrate a centuries-old organization that is powerful enough to topple empires? November only knows that she'll do whatever it takes to save her father . . . or die trying.Review: Overall, this was a good book. It had a lot of action in it and the writing was really well done. The world building was also great and the pacing matched the tone of the book.However, I feel like the book was a bit too tropey for me. It was a bit like Bourne Identity and it had the feel of it, but I just felt like it followed the tropes that a lot of action/thriller/spy books do. The romance also felt force and the characters didn’t feel that developed to me.Verdict: It was good, but not my style.
3553678208	~𝟐.𝟕𝟓 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐬I’m a little disappointed in this sequel for Killing November. There was a lot of things in the first one that bothered me, but I looked past it because the aesthetic for the story was so captivating. Unfortunately, they leave the school in this one so it’s just Ash and November running around making mistakes. Which is funny because Ash is supposed to be trained and I don’t see anything but two teenagers. It would be a lot better if November had full training and actually knew what she was doing- the whole clueless act in MCs is getting old. I did like the plot twist at the end and the friend group that was built, but I felt like November and Ash’s relationship did not convince me that they were in love. The problem with this read is that it was just bland. I didn’t feel anything AT ALL while reading this (except for annoyed at some parts). I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t love it- it just was kind of a waste of time.

4314701451	November has only been at the Academy for a few weeks, but she has survived multiple attacks on her life. After reading book one; Killing November, we learn that November's father is in danger. This book seriously jumps right into it and the search for her father is on. She survived the Academy, so how hard can it be hiding from everyone who is hunting her and finding her father? Thoughts, hmmmmm.. So I definitely enjoyed this one, HOWEVER, it wasn't as good as book one ! It was still action packed, and the hunt for her father was a blast but it didn't hold my attention as much as I expected. It definitely gets better the further into the story you get, and once the fighting starts it gets really good. However, the ending also just didn't do it for me. Like I said, it was still really good but it had nothing on Killing November. ★★★.5 Perhaps I just loved book one too much and I shouldn't be comparing them. If you've read these I definitely want to hear your thoughts!
3761116686	https://songedunenuitdete.com/2021/01...Dans l’ensemble, j’ai passé un très bon moment de lecture avec cette suite. Hunting November est un titre qui cible avant tout les adolescents. De fait, l’intrigue n’est pas bien compliquée et l’autrice s’attarde essentiellement sur le ressenti de ces personnages.Dans mon cas, cela ne m’a pas dérangé. J’ai apprécié le duo Ash/November. J’ai également beaucoup ri. Et de bon cœur en plus ! Je pense spécialement à une scène d’anthologie dans laquelle November doit récupérer des informations auprès de l’un des contacts de son père. La pauvre finit beurrée comme un Petit Lu. C’était très marrant.Voilà un titre que je vous conseille si vous voulez vous détendre avec une histoire sans grande prise de tête, plutôt bien ficelée. Ce genre de roman, ça se lit comme on engloutit un pain au chocolat.
3309309607	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hunting November is the sequel to Killing November, which came out this past May. Hunting November picks up right where the first book left off, like practically in the middle of the scene a little bit. So, I highly suggest reading the two relatively close together. I was slightly apprehensive to read the second book, solely because I was so nervous it wouldn't live up to the first. But that wasn't the case at all. From the first sentence, you are launched back into the world of spies and assassins with the same funny rhetoric that was in the first book. Something else that I found that Mather did really well is let the storyline build on its own. She doesn't rush to the punch and all of the side storylines add on beautifully to the plot. Crossing my fingers there is a spinoff or a third book set in the future. ..#books #booksofinstagram #bookstagrammersunite
3305225923	Wow! This sequel was an exciting next step in the November story! I loved this story took us all over the place! I liked the scavenger hunt mixed with Mission Impossible feel that this plot gave the reader!Hunting November picks right up where Killing November stops. All November wants now is to find her father. She sets off with her friends on a scavenger hunt, going from clue to clue. The hunt takes the group from November’s home town to Europe where they bounce around the country in search of their next answer. The final clue lands them in enemy territory and is filled with betrayal, secrets, and deceit.The action throughout Hunting November was quite intense, and I LOVED it, but I did miss the overall excitement that came from the first book. I really enjoyed November’s introduction and understanding of her new world in Killing November, and I missed that in book 2. Outside of that, I have no complaints about this addition to the November series.The characters were very likable, but the side characters were so wonderful. Some are funny, some are witty, but overall, they just become these friends that you want to have in real life. I wasn’t super connected in the story’s romance, but I felt like there was so much other stuff going on, I was okay with not being 100% invested in that relationship.To Read or Not To Read:I would recommend Hunting November for readers that like a dark young adult story with a mystery to solve. I would recommend that readers read book 1 in this series, Killing November, before jumping into this book. I think you would find the book much more enjoyable if you read the first book before starting this one.I was provided an advanced reader's copy of this book for free. I am leaving my review voluntarily.My full review of this book will post to my blog on 4/28/20. All of my reviews can be found at https://shejustlovesbooks.com/all-boo...
4426898536	What I like about this book is that it’s not the usual romantic love story, - also that, but much more a story about love between friends and family. Beautiful strong love. Also, that it’s not just any fantasy world with magical unrealistic abilities, but that it is somehow still related to our world and mostly about excellent skills that I love to read about. And finally, that it’s full of riddles and psychological analyses - fantastic combination!
4808418526	t really liked this just not as much as the first book sadly :(. HER AND ASH MY BABIESSSSS. Also Arya love her. I wish we got more of Layla and Mateo in this book as they weren’t really in it as much as I wish they were. The ending also felt a little rushed BUT THAT PLOT TWIST DANG. if you liked Wednesday read this book they are so similar. I love this series and I need more of this authors writing. This is such a comfort series for me and I loved the academy sm, so sad it’s over
3178022675	It’s a telltale sign of an amazing book for me when I’m reading for the enjoyment of every step of the story without just trying to “find out what happens.” There is not a dull moment in this book- every single moment was riveting, keeping you on the edge of your seat. Adriana Mather’s descriptions also set the stage to be able to picture everything so well. So atmospheric and a phenomenal sequel to Killing November.
6510080490	No tiene el misterio que tenía la primer parte pero si el suspenso de saber que es lo que va a pasar luego. Creo que si vuelvo a escuchar la palabra “strategia” me voy a pegar un tiro jajajaa pero bueno, me gustó que Aria e Inés aparecieran, al igual que Mateo y Layla. Para pasar el rato, vale la pena.
4473413612	I really enjoyed this! The writing was entertaining, the humor was just right up my alley and I liked November! The Strategia world was interesting I would say. There are some logical issues tho. I’ve already talked about this in the review of the first book. But it didn’t bother me that much. It’s a fun YA duology!
3650424038	After surviving the events of book 1, November only wants to find her father. But she must follow the strange clues he left her and that isn't going to be easy. Luckily she has her friends because, without them, she would not know how to survive.I love the characters, the action is nonstop, and the twists are truly unexpected. Great follow-up to the first one, with a satisfying ending - no cliffhanger. Not sure if the story will continue...
5278235092	Amazing but the only thing was that in the end November doesn't want to go to America as urgently as she wanted to go before. Maybe cause she has embraced her Strategia self but still, It's like she has forgotten about Emily, there is only like what one line about wanting to go see her in the end. I would have liked to see Emily meet other her other Strategia friends. Apart that all was perfect. Really need a part 3. Pls let there be a part 3 🙏

3290704947	I received an eARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Overall, I really enjoyed this book, I would say it's a definite 3.75 stars.We pick right up from the action at the end of Killing November, which was a little disorienting since I haven't read the book in a year. We immediately jump into action as the characters race off into action, getting the party started. I thought it was a great end to Killing November. There was action (duh, they're like spies), drama, and good endearing moments. The biggest reasons why I didn't give this a higher rating though is 1) I was immediately thrown into action with no recap, or explanation, just action. I'm not a big fan of that personally. 2) There were some moments where certain characters experienced a total personality switch from book 1 to 2. And it remains unexplained. 3) I thought the ending was sweet, but it was predictable and felt a little lack luster to me. Besides those issues I thought this was an awesome sequel! We get a nice, even end to November's story and I'm fairly satisfied.
3292888101	A must read for anyone who loves boarding schools or spies. Hunting November is a breathtaking sequel to Killing November with more secrets and lies than ever.
3284407970	When I read Killing November, I was beyond impressed. When I read Hunting November, I was floored. It's rarely possible to write a sequel that's just as good..if not better..than the first story. But Adriana Mather did it again! I read this book in two and a half days. I could not put it down! And just when I thought I had it all figured out, Adriana would throw out more twists and turns. The suspense in this novel was absolutely stunning. I was willing to stay up late..extremely late..each night, knowing I had to get up early the next morning for work. Adriana continues to develop the characters from Killing November into Hunting November..and it's crystal clear who you're rooting for..and who you aren't. When I read a book, I think long and hard, wondering if it would could carry over into a movie. With both Killing November and Hunting November..the answer is a big YES! Adriana is able to paint the picture of her characters and storylines so clearly, you feel like you're right there, in the middle of the action. Should you read Killing November? Yes. Should you read Hunting November? Yes. Be prepared for a ride..with plot twists you won't see coming in a million years!
3319712446	** spoiler alert ** I came into this with low expectations, but by the time I finished the book, I felt utterly exhausted by its repetitive, poorly structured writing. It's a shame because the characters aren't bad per se: November has enough personality and grit to make her an okay protagonist, and while she gets help, she doesn't get things done for her. Her friends are vital to her story but they don't exist simply to prop her up. Most of them join her quest for their own reasons. My absolute favourite since book one has been Aarya, and I'm glad we got to know her and Ines better.The lovestory is more or less bearable too, mostly because it's not as central to the plot as it would have been in most YA stories.The whole Strategia stuff made me roll my eyes more than once and required a lot of suspension of disbelief. For one thing, if most Families work towards the same important goals, why do they do so separately? Wouldn't it be easier to abolish the archaic clannishness and unite? Since they have a Council anyway. Secondly, even though several of the characters bring up the great common good Strategia do for the world, we never actually get to see that. What we do see is an insane school that is for some reason considered a safe place, and lots of infighting. Taking all that into account, the Jackal Family, which is an outlier among the rest of the Strategia, actually seems the smartest.I don't get the reason for November's big quest either (much like the character herself, actually, since she does have the brain to wonder about this!). What was the whole point of all the clues? Her Dad explains only the last note; the rest is history. And the whole plan of sending November to the Academy to do things without explaining anything to her still feels undercooked and plain dangerous.Jag turns out to be an incredibly boring and cliched villain, more of a circumstance than a human being, which is especially disappointing after all the ominous setup. He even wears a cape with red velvet padding! What is he, Dracula!?But my biggest complaint is the writing itself. All the things that irked me in book one doubled and tripled in this one. All the "I see/think/know", "judging by", "I feel like", etc. - are they really necessary, if November is a POV character and we already perceive everything through her? The neverending "my stomach churns", "my heart leaps", etc. sometimes happen twice a page or more. Yes, she's scared, we got it. Every time there is a door, it is opened/closed, the hinges whine, the room is peered into (if not entered). All the rooms have dark paneling, a fireplace, and fancy candelabra - yes, we get it, Strategia dig "medieval" style. Don't get me started on how many times the word "Lion" is used when they do get to that Family's property. And finally, everybody is constantly looking at something or at each other. It comes up so frequently, especially around dialogue tags, that the only thing you can visualize is characters constantly turning their heads. It is especially jarring in those scenes where there are only two characters present, and you'd think they were already looking at each other since they were talking. Combined with the overuse of the same basic structure of sentences (f.ex. "..." he says, and I look at...), it looks like the writing of a child.I really wish this book had been better because I loved the emphasis on friendship (November and Emily, Aarya and Ines, November and Layla, even November and Aarya) and family (again, Aarya and Ines, November and her Dad, November and Matteo), which feels more prominent than the emphasis on romantic love.
3278974847	Wow! Are the first words out of my mouth after closing the last page of this book. Adriana has such an incredible way of enticing you right off the bat. Once i started reading the first page, i had to fight myself to put it down. Adriana has such an incredible way of telling a story that not only keeps you guessing but completely throws some surpises at you as well. There are so many incredible details in this story, about history and facts that you feel like you are in the book. Like you're November. You feel every feeling her character is feeling as she goes through these intricate,life changing experiences all the while finding out not only who she is but who her family is. She finds herself,and finds faith in thoughs as well as finding her natural born instincts. You will catch yourself trying to figure it out as you go. Dont!. You wont be able to figure out Adriana's infinite play on words. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it without a doubt, blew my mind. Surely a must read.
3304840249	I loved the first book in this series so much that I sat down and read it in a single day. The second book started off a little slow for my preference, but it really picked up in the second half and I found myself enjoying the book nearly as much as I had enjoyed the first one.This books takes us from November's school, to her hometown, and then to Europe, where the characters are led on a thrilling high-stakes adventure as November tries to find her dad. They confront and escape several powerful assassins along the way. This was a bit unbelievable, but suspending that notion, overall the book was highly enjoyable. If you're looking for a fast fun read, I recommend this book.
2971192911	Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with a DRC of this title for review. All opinions are my own.I loved this book. It is one of my favorites I have read so far this year and I might have even liked it more than the first book in the series. This book picks up from the MOMENT book one ends and it doesn't let up. November and her friends are on the hunt for Jag, the notorious leader of the Lion Families who has been dismantling the respect and camaraderie of the Strategia families. He has issued the order for November's father to be killed and she knows she has to try to save him, even if she is underprepared and overwhelmed by the thought of going up against not only the worst of the Strategia, but the man who is her grandfather. There are twists, turns, some cool strategies and interesting fights. Highly highly recommend this one. Appropriate for grades 7 and up.
3255032927	I am extremely lucky to have been included in the ARC tour for this book. It starts off where the first book left off with November and Ashai getting ready to leave Academy Absconditi to search for her father. They start their journey by going back to where it began in Pembrook and from there they find themselves in the United Kingdom from Scotland to London. They are thrown into so many different deadly situations to find more clues that her father left for her to find. On their way there are surprise allies that show up to help with the mission. They find themselves in deep in enemy territory Where it comes to a very mind boggling, edge of your seat ending. I really love the chemistry between November and Ashai. It was very welcome surprise at how many allies came to help them on their mission to save her father and was very excited at how it all just worked. I can not wait to find out how November's story continues.

Normally, I’d find books like these and wait until the series was done before picking them up, but after find Adriana nearly 4 years ago, I’ve followed her books so closely. She never fails to give her readers something they don’t want to put down.In this sequel to Killing November, Adriana takes the readers from the Academy to the streets of several cities. This continues shortly after we left November and brings us through important changes and experiences in November’s life as well as the lives of all Strategia. November’s relationships with the other around her truly shows her kindness and willing to do what is right. I love the easy banter between Ash and November as well as the protectiveness that’s grows the more they are together. This book is more than a brief escape, it’s like making friends and tackling challenges you never expected to face. The characters are more than just names printed on the pages, but people you see grow, trust and can’t wait to see more of. I can’t wait to see if we get more of November, Ash and the Academy, but I know that whatever comes next is definitely worth the wait!
