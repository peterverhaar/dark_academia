3059348122	3.5This reads like something I would have devoured as a kid: a great title, a boarding school, some creepy secret societies, found families, and lots of interesting school/research side quests. What can I say, I was always a nerd. Writing: ★★★★Characters: ★★★Memorable?: ★★★★ 1/2Pacing: ★★★ 1/2The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane follows the adventures of Emmy, a girl who's father disappeared when she was 3 years old, and who's mother is a child psychology literary star with, ironically, no time at all to raise her daughter by the standards she dictates. With her mother's career rocketing into the the spotlight, Emmy is shipped away to Wellsworth, a prestigious private boarding school in England. Emmy is not really happy with this turn of events, but a mysterious letter referencing her father compels her to explore Wellsworth...and see if maybe the trail to her father isn't as cold as it appears. Emmy and her new friends soon discover that Wellsworth is hiding secrets, and those secrets have secrets. Will Emmy discover the truth behind her father's disappearance, or will she find herself at the heart of a larger plot? I found The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane to be extremely well written, engaging, and worth the time as an adult reader. In a way, it reminded me of old-school Disney movies as the audience is clearly middle grade, but the hints of adult awareness and humor are there. I'd imagine that parents would have a great time reading this aloud to their children. Excited to see the next installment!

2447125622	Look at this cover. Now back at me. Now BACK to this cover. The cover is amazing! It gets better every time you look at it, with tiny clues and symbols around the edges of the spooky-mysterious central picture. But, you ask, is the book inside as good as the cover?Yes. Yes it is.It's a boarding school story that reminded me quite a lot of Harry Potter (though there is no magic here, but that's okay!), and a twisty mystery that made me think of National Treasure, only British. There's a lot going on, and it's wonderful! Evil roommates, infuriating adults, thrilling sports, enigmatic teachers, new friendships, secret passages, arcane symbols, ancient artifacts . . . I mean, seriously, it has everything, and it's all brought together so well, and so believably! I just ADORED this book, I really did! And you will too! Next year! I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy so that I could blurb it, and I'm sorry to tease . . . okay, not that sorry! HAHAHAHA! But seriously: Next year. You'll love it.
2475378697	The digital arc of this book was kindly provided by the publisher via Edelweiss+ website in exchange for an honest review.4,5 starsThis middle-grade debut novel really caught my attention from the very beginning. I tend to really enjoy books set in boarding schools and this one was no exception. I haven't read such a thrilling and exciting mystery novel in a while and because it's middle-grade, there weren't many distractions (e.g. love interests) from the main plot like it is often the case with YA or adult mysteries. I also loved Emmy and her friends a lot, their friendship was a bit too instantaneous but I loved their banter and relationship overall nonetheless. There was a small historical aspect to the story as well, concerning the school building and the whole mystery plot, which added a nice touch to the book. The only small problems I had were a few tropes, like absent and neglectful parents and the horrible roommate, which irked me quite a bit but they weren't prominent enough to make my reading experience less enjoyable.I would really recommend to check out this book even if you don't like middle-grade because the mystery, in my opinion, is worth it.
4642532078	Boarding School & Secret Societies?! Yes please.As an adult reading this Middle School book, it was entertaining yet frustrating at the same time. The parental neglect that seems to never be acknowledged is not okay. MC Emmy manages to make some friends & come out of her suffer in silence shell so as to not seem so much a doormat. The secret society aspect is very mysterious & eery with a believable background. Is this the greatest book ever? No. But it is entertaining with plenty of plot & character development hence the 3 stars. A quick read if you are in between books.
2665493792	3.5 stars. For a debut novel this is pretty good. Nothing super original here in terms of plot: girl sent to boarding school, makes a couple key friends, secret society (passage ways and all), bullying, absent parents, etc. Lots of intrigue, some action, tons of time spent doing homework, some soccer (football), and a good dose of mystery. CharactersOne of the stand-out pieces of Julia Nobel's debut is that the narrative of our lead gal is very strong. Right from the first couple chapters I felt like she had a dominant, prevalent voice. Her personality shone through and she felt very real to me. Sadly the secondary characters were all a little flat, even the two best friends. I'm hoping this is an area that Nobel's writing improves and evolves in. After all the world expects well written secondary characters since Hermoine and Ron entered our lives. Continuing StoryThis is a part of a series, and so not all of our questions are answered in this first book. However, enough of the mystery is revealed so as to not feel ripped off. The biggest thing that bugs me about the whole set-up, and what will continue, is our lead gals Mother. She's supposed to be a parenting expert; yet she's a really crappy Mom (not unlike Leonard on Big Bang Theory's mother). I'm not sure the choice to make her a parenting expert really made sense. I get the idea of her fame being in the way of parenting, and all that jazz; but I would have preferred she was just a movie star or something. Unless in the next book (or two?) we actually delve into the psychosis of having a mother who is a parenting expert. Given this is a middle grade book I'm going to say that is unlikely. OverallThis is a decent read. It kept me occupied for a period of time and reads up quickly. There's not a lot of fancy vocabulary in The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane, which is good for a middle grade book. I feel if I went back and analyzed this closely there are probably some plot holes and issues; but I didn't have any jump off the page at me or get in my way of enjoying the story. Overall a decent debut by a Canadian author; and so I am rounding up my 3.5 stars to 4. A tidbit of advice from this book that stuck out to me: "...when you prepare for the absolute worst, nothing can be as bad as what you’ve imagined."Please note: I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. This is an honest and unbiased review.
4584105526	This is the first instalment in the Black Hollow Lane series.Subtly eerie and full of mysteries but a little too slow to develop for me, initially. I still look forward to continuing on with the series, due to my love for the central trio of characters and my heightened intrigue as the novel progressed.
2768614314	Sometimes you see a cover and just know that this is a book you must read. But I’ve been fooled before by covers, thankfully this wasn’t one of those times. The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane is a terrific middle-grade mystery adventure debut novel.Description:With a dad who disappeared years ago and a mother who’s a bit too busy to parent, Emmy is shipped off to Wellsworth, a prestigious boarding school in England, where she’s sure she won’t fit in.But then she finds a box of mysterious medallions in the attic of her home—medallions that belonged to her father. Her father who may have gone to Wellsworth.When she arrives at school, she finds the strange symbols from the medallions etched into walls and books, which leads Emmy and her new friends, Jack and Lola, to Wellsworth’s secret society: The Order of Black Hollow Lane. Emmy can’t help but think that the society had something to do with her dad’s disappearance, and that there may be more than just dark secrets in the halls of Wellsworth.Thoughts:There is just something about books that have kids in boarding schools that I really tend to enjoy. Boarding schools just seem to me to be the perfect setting for mysteries, life-long friendships, and are ripe with opportunities for sneaking out past curfew.In this middle grade adventure, the author has woven, not just one but two mysteries into the story while at the same time guiding Emmy through classes, bullies, and sports. The main mystery of this book is about a secret society called The Order of the Black Hollow Lane – the type of secret society that attempts to guide businesses and politics from behind the scenes. Wellsworth is the place where they start to find and train new members – all through the Latin club. The second mystery, which will probably be an over-arching mystery for the series, is about her father. Wellsworth isn’t apparently some random private school in Britain, but instead is where her father went to school. Some of the teachers knew her father and yet won’t talk about him. But Emmy’s questions still persist: What happened to him? Is he really dead? If he is alive why isn’t he around? Does the Black Hollow Lane have anything to do with his disappearance?Together with two new wonderful friends, Lola and Jack, they begin to try and put the pieces together regarding the secret society and Emmy’s father, that includes a few close calls with curfew, teachers, and a mysterious secret passageway.Audio Book Review:Another terrific audio book to listen to narrated by Saskia Maarleveld, who has done many, many other audio books such as The Alice Network, The Victory Garden, and What the Wind Knows. With so many different accents to listen in this story from American to British to Scottish my ears were never bored and never once did I not know who was speaking. But in addition to the different accents, I enjoyed listening to the emotion that was played out in several of the characters. Mysteries and ghost stories are always perfect choices for audio because they can add so much ambience to the story and make you wait patiently for the next thrilling moment instead of allowing you to do a speed-read to find out what happens. In short, this new middle grade mystery story is absolutely fun and wonderful and I can’t wait for the next in the series.
5046222544	just realized i have a severe middle grade deficiency and i need to fix it ASAP
2885345218	ugh the Harry Potter-esque feels.This was hella cute! The boarding school + some Malfoy-esque characters + a McGonagall-like teacher + quidditch being football instead + a secret society are all elements that make for a book I am going to like. I feel deprived that I never got to go to a boarding school as a kid. Weird shit always happens at them! See examples: Harry Potter, Truly Devious, this book.
2160712689	I read this manuscript during Pitch Wars last year and it was FABULOUS. It blew me away and I knew right away it was The One. I can't wait to see it in its final form! It is spooky, mysterious, and absorbing, and I fell in love with the characters from page one. There are many boarding school mysteries out there, but there's something so unique and gorgeous about this one with its spunky cast, vein of family loss and longing, and eerie Gothic setting where no one can be trusted. Keep your eye on this one!
3971801802	Not reinventing the wheel here, but solid choice for anyone who enjoys boarding school books, secret societies, and found family stories. Watch me discuss it here: https://youtu.be/UjQQc19Y9SE

3097557652	چقدر خوشحالم که سال ۲۰۲۰ رو با کتابی جذاب شروع کردم. اولش انتظار داشتم کتاب فانتزی باشه، اما در کمال تعجب هیچ اثری از جادو و جن و پری در کتاب به چشمم نخورد و متوجه شدم با کتاب جنایی نوجوانان روبه‌رو هستم! کتاب خیلی جذاب و تا حدی غافلگیر‌کننده بود و خوشم اومد که قشنگ داستان رو کشوند به کتاب دوم. امیدوارم کتاب دوم هم به همین خوبی باشه
2992432930	Emmy discovers that her dead father left behind a mysterious box of medallions with a note urging her to keep them safe. When her mother sends her to boarding school in England, Emmy thinks the medallions have some connection to the old school. Perhaps her father was a student there at some point and copied the odd symbols that are engraved on library books and wall carvings about the school. Emmy enlists the help of her new friends, Jack and Lola, and they investigate the existence of an underground society that will go to any lengths to hide their secrets. Now Emmy isn't even sure if her father is really dead, or if the secret society is hiding something even more dastardly.I loved the mystery in this book! The secret symbols and hidden passages and puzzling notes hidden in the pocket of a coat. One of the best things about this mystery is the shadow of ancient history looming over every clue. The secret society appears to be hundreds of years old with a long history of working outside the law. This gave a delicious depth to the world-building, especially since our characters are living at a school that used to be an old abbey in ancient times. Emmy is a wonderful main character. She is plucky and tough, but she gets discouraged sometimes, and needs her friends to give her some hope. I really liked how she gradually opens up about her grief over losing her father, and her friends share their own troubles with their difficult families. They are the misfits of the school, so I loved how they band together and support each other.The writing really captured my attention and made me care about the characters. The mystery was delightful, and I can't wait to read the second book!To see the mild violence and other sensitive content in this book, check it out on the Screen It First website! https://screenitfirst.com/book/the-my...
5628117685	A boarding school mystery to be solved and family secrets to uncover.Emily is 12 years old. When she was 3, her father disappeared and her mother is a well known child psychology writer that ironically has no time for her own daughter.So she ends up sending Emmy to a boarding school in England. Being the new kid at a new school is always challenging and Emmy has to catch up with classes in a foreign country.However Emmy also wants to find out as much as she can from her father. A mysterious letter she received makes her believe that she will be able to uncover her family secrets at this school.A great coming of age story with a found family and many secrets to uncover that will help Emmy understand what happened to her father.A perfect quick mystery read set in a boarding school for middle grade readers.Even though I had a really good time with the book I didn't love it as much as I had hoped. Some of the character relationships felt forced or unrealistic. Emmy's mom also changes quite a bit throughout the book with much explanation on why the sudden change of character.But overall this was an enjoyable cozy mystery that will continue in book 2
4041718729	That was a lovely, funny, heart-warming and adventureous story. loved the characters and the friendships with found family included. Also the audiobook narration was great! cannot wait to get to the next one.
4288129245	3.5 stars.THIS WAS SO WHOLESOME.
2948822721	When Emmeline Willick's mother, a well-known American parenting expert, gets a job on a television show, leaving her little time to spend with her own daughter, Emmy is shipped off to boarding school in England. Once there, at the prestigious co-educational Wellsworth School, she confronts all of the usual challenges facing a new girl at school: struggling to find her feet socially, to come to terms with her difficult roommate, and to catch up with her studies. Emmy ends up making good friends with Lola Boyd and Jack Galt, two other students in her year, and joins the football (soccer) team. She also joins the Latin Club, at the insistence of her housemistress, and soon finds herself caught up in an extraordinary mystery involving her own father, who went missing years ago, on her third birthday. It turns out that Thomas Allyn was also once a student at Wellsworth, and a member of the sinister Order of Black Hollow Lane. As Emmy searches for answers to her long-held questions about her father's disappearance, she involves herself and her friends in a dangerous quest...The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane has a number of elements - the school story setting, the mystery involving a secret society, the small band of loyal friends - that I find appealing, so when I saw an online friend reviewing it, I immediately sought it out. Insofar as I am influenced by such things as cover art, I found the decorative dust-jacket lovely, and was drawn in by that as well. Oddly enough, despite every expectation to the contrary, I couldn't become involved in the story, the first time I tried to read it, and had to set it aside. I suspect that it was just poor timing, because when picked it up again a few days ago, I read it speedily, and with enjoyment. I had my suspicions throughout, thinking that (view spoiler)[Master Barlowe was secretly a villain (hide spoiler)], but I turned out to be mistaken. I was looking for an unlikely adversary, but I didn't land on the correct character, which I appreciated. I like my mysteries to have a few surprises! It's clear that author Julia Nobel, who made her debut here, was influenced by the Harry Potter series. Although not fantastical, some of the other elements here - coming to a school you didn't know existed, where the parent(s) you never knew also attended, becoming part of a close-knit trio of friends, getting involved in a conflict with sinister forces - were very reminiscent of Rowling's books. Even the concluding chapters, in which the three friends descend into a subterranean world underneath the school, in order to confront the villain, felt similar.Despite my rocky start, I definitely enjoyed this one - thanks for bringing it to my attention, Constance! - and will be seeking out the sequel, The Secret of White Stone Gate . Recommended to school story lovers, and to reader who enjoy middle-grade mysteries.
2475143311	A great story and fun to read. Very Harry Potter-esq minus the magic. A mystery to solve, daring midnight escapades and likeable characters. Although the story wraps up in this book, I want more!
3287966794	Dnf at 63% I just couldn't keep reading about the predictable things that the main character would do.
3926687849	This has now become one of my favorite middle grades! Although at one point the plot was predictable it was an exciting fun read.
5381169602	THE MYSTERY OF BLACK HOLLOW LANE by Julia NobelThis novel is perfect for ages 9-14 or reading as a family. The story starts as the main character is shipped off to a boarding school in England. Emmy find herself all alone in a new school and having never boarded before. She’s also dealing with an emotionally detached mother and the loss of her father at a young age. Despite this she quickly makes friends with Lola and Jack and her journey begins.While at Wellsworth, she learns a little of her dad’s history, is sent cryptic letters, and delves into the the very mysterious Latin Society and “Order”. The biggest takeaway from this novel is the power of friendships that last.
3468540508	This was such a pleasant book... absolutely loved Emy and her friends, how she overcame her relationship with her mother... how she found a place to call home and friends to call family...i highly recommend this book and i can't wait to read the following books
3922381895	2.5/5 rounded up. Super sad to not have fallen in love with this book. Based off the beginning, I had my hopes high. But it’s just an underwhelming book for me and, in my opinion, it’s too close to seeming like Harry Potter but without the magic. Emmy’s father is MIA and whether he’s alive or not is not certain. Although Emmy barely remembers her father since he left when she was 2 or 3 (I think it was 3), she still feels like she wants to know what happened to him or why he left. One day Emmy finds a mysterious box with medallions in it and a note from her father basically asking her to keep them safe. Emmy’s mom sends her to Wellsworth boarding school and some mysteriously events begin to happen. Along with her friends, Jack and Lola, she discovers information about some secret Order and possibly a connection between them and her father. Maybe some accidents around the boarding school were never really “accidents” either. And maybe it isn’t so safe for Emmy on the campus.Similarities to Harry Potter that I just felt were too similar is the secret ‘Order’, there are Houses in the school you can belong to, some nice and some questionably evil teachers, and at the end — summer approaching so school not in session so Emmy’s going back with her mom — Emmy makes a comment about she’s not going home cause Wellsworth is her home. Cue a young Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) “I’m not going home…not really.” I really loved the idea of this book and I could have overlooked the HP similarities if I enjoyed the overall story. It started out promising, but I just grew bored. Nothing too original happened and I’m sorry to say all this. I really wanted to love this from how it started off. 😔 Can’t win them all.
2707568670	A rather dark boarding school tale, appropriate for 6th grade and up. Emmy is sent from Connecticut to boarding school with secret cargo -- a pewter box of medals that belonged to the father she has not seen since her 3rd birthday. You want to root for Emmy. She has a crummy roommate and some mysterious assignments that begin to lead her deeper into the mystery surrounding her dad's disappearance. Two other students join her quest and there is much to write about in a sequel. Looking forward to it!Thank you to Sourcebooks and Edelweiss for a digital ARC of this debut novel.
3110350784	This was an interesting read! I love stories that involve boarding schools, mysteries, secret societies, etc. This reminded me a lot of the old show House of Anubis, which I loved! I do wish there would have been more going on throughout the book. I feel like most of the action and findings took place in the last 1/4 of the story, but I’m hoping in the second book it will be more spread throughout the entire book! Nonetheless, I think this was great, and I’m looking forward to reading the next in the series!
4174829181	3.5 🌟i wish the ending was a bit less rushed
5042989302	This is another one of those books where I’m not sure how I heard of it, but have absolutely no regrets putting it on my TBR list!In The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane, Emmy, the daughter of a prestigious parenting guru, is sent to Wellsworth, a boarding school in England so that her mother can film a TV series about giving parents advice. She’s initially very down about this idea, especially since her mother has banned her from playing football, but when she discovers that Wellsworth has a connection to her missing father, the mystery is all she can think about.Honestly, this book was so much fun! It’s quite clearly middle grade, given that almost everyone in this book is about twelve, but it doesn’t talk down to the reader. The stakes are high – Emmy has a mysterious chest of medallions that she’s found – and I never doubted that the mysterious secret society in the book was dangerous. However, Emmy is also twelve and no Alex Rider, so the challenges she faces make sense for her.Emmy’s friends, Lola and Jack, are lovely supporting characters! I really liked the bond that the three of them have and how they befriended and supported Emmy so quickly. The development of their friendship was one of the high points of the book.There are a few serious issues in this book – like parental relationships and bullying, but the book doesn’t address this as much. I felt that Emmy’s strained relationship with her roommate Victoria could have been used to explore both issues more, but it also makes sense that the book wants to focus on the mystery. Since there’s a second book, I hope that this subplot will continue to develop and we’ll get an interesting and complex friend/enemy relationship from this! I also hope that we’ll get to see more of Emmy’s relationship with her mother; there’s clearly a lot of resentment as Emmy feels neglected and forbidden from playing her favourite sport, but Emmy is also strangely obedient to her mother, mostly following her instructions even though her mother is overseas.Overall, I thought that this was a fun adventure! I see that there’s a sequel and I’m definitely going to read that – I want to see how the adventure continues!This review was first posted at Eustea Reads
4673531958	I had so much fun reading The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane! This was recommended to me by a friend after I mentioned I wanted to read more Middle Grade books and venturing into the genre with a bit of a mystery to solve was a wonderful experience! :DThe setting here and Emmy's perspective really won me over. Nobel did a fantastic job at presenting and developing Emmy as a character and narrator and I really enjoyed her point of view and connected to what she was going through. Her love for football and her struggles regarding her parents were both well woven into the story and it was a great experience going on this journey with her.The overall mystery plot was very intriguing and I loved how it was initially set up. I loved all the secrecy and the little bits and pieces of very suspicious information we got throughout the story and how most of them were tied together. I did have a tiny bit of an issue with how some twists were revealed and how convenient they were--though I'm not sure if that was on purpose in like with the genre? Still had a lot of fun, though!The ending was also pretty interesting and left me with a bunch of questions regarding some of the information we got during the final chapters. There was obviously a lot going on and it was more complex than we thought, so I'm pretty curious to see how that's going to go in the next book!
3581546200	3.5 stars. This woman really copy/pasted Harry Potter, deleted the magic and added a female protagonist. I respect the audacity.
6185839726	This book was so Harry Potter coded 🏫🍂 I loved all the cozy boarding school adventures, can’t wait for book two 🗝️🍁🕯️📚
3003672758	I want to start this book review off by saying that parents who don’t listen to their kids are really annoying and i truly wanted to throttle nearly every parent in this book.I’m lucky my mom always is and was so active in my life and listened to me and is so involved in my life and my choices because WHEW. Reading this and some of the parenting choices in this made me absolutely want to scream. Your child is a PERSON, respect them.Ahem, so hi 🙂Emmy’s dad disappeared when she was three years old and all traces of him, photographs, relics, memories, did as well. That is until a mysterious box with medallions and a note arrive. The note states:These belonged to your father.Emmy’s mother is a famous child psychologist and is busy with work and traveling and has decided to send Emmy to a prestigious boarding school far in England far from her home in Connecticut. She has difficulty adjusting at first due to the hard coursework, and mean girl roommate, oh and there’s also the strange Latin club which is a front for the school’s super secret society – The Order of the Black Lane. Emmy and her friends, Jack and Lola, begin to dive deeper into the school’s secrets and mysteries unaware that they aren’t the only ones seeking them as well.First things first, yes. Yes, this does remind me of Harry Potter in so many ways. Now that we’ve got that out of the way let me continue my rant about the HORRID FUCKING PARENTING IN THIS FUCKING BOOK. So Emmy’s mom is a famous child psychologist. She wrote a book about it and is going around tour in America for it I guess. It begins with them going to a party and a bomb is dropped that Emmy is going to be sent to a boarding school in England. Like…she didn’t even tell her daughter this and expects her to be calm about it?? The best part is when Emmy gets to England. She loves soccer and is great at it. But oh no, her mom wants her to focus on studying because if Emmy’s grades get bad it POORLY REFLECTS ON HER BECAUSE SHE’S THE FAMOUS PSYCHOLOGIST. SHE ALSO FORGOT HER CHILD’S BIRTHDAY.I. hate. her.Also the fact that she never talks to Emmy about her dad but…Okay, ranting over.This was a nice book. I love books about boarding schools so I was all over it. Emmy is brave, smart, and punched a bitch in the eye. Proud of my girl. Lola and Jack were great as well. Jack’s older brothers are both in that stupid order and so is his dad so they hate him which…whatever and Lola’s mom is the headmistress which is pretty cool.Unfortunately the plot was weak and the mystery just was not that mysterious, I found myself losing interest halfway through and could not really remember the point of the entire story. It did start to pick up again around the end but by then you already guessed who the bad guys were since it is glaringly obvious. The end felt pretty rushed as well but I do have to say that I am pretty excited to read the second book and see where we go from here.Honestly, I’m not too interested in Secret Orders or medallions but I do want to know more about Emmy’s dad and see how these three friends grow up with one another because if there’s one thing that strengthens over time and causes growth within oneself its a healthy loving friendship.3.5/5
2685079255	The Mystery Of Black Hollow Lane is so good, I didn’t want it to end! Emmy is shipped to a boarding school in England while her mother is busy with her career. She doesn’t know much about her father, but keeps discovering mysterious pieces from his past. This book does have a Harry Potter feel to it, but it didn’t take away from the story at all. Emmy was determined to find out more about her father and with each secret she uncovers things get more intense at school, I loved the characters, the storyline and all the mystery! So fun! I received this book in exchange for my honest review, my opinions are my own. Thank you to Sourcebooks and NetGalley for this ARC! This will be featured on my blog Tuesday January 22, 2019Www.colecampfireblog.comLanaLCole@yahoo.com
2429013199	I loved this book and can't wait for the next book in the series. This story had every element I love... boarding school, friendships, mean girls and a spooky mystery to solve. The book follows Emmy, a daughter of "parenting expert mom" on TV who is very busy and decides to send her to a boarding school in England. Wellsworth School is a mystery on it's own and Emmy soon finds out her absent father used to attend the school. Emmy and her friends soon stumble on a secret society within the school called The Order of The Black Hollow Lane. I do not want to go into the story more as to not spoil it but I highly recommend it and I do plan on continuing with this series.
3233893684	ugh. i have been distracted for the past few weeks because all the covid-19 issues in my country that affect my well-being. i picked up this book because it seems light and it sounds like something i would've loved as a kid. but all this issue about emmy and her dad is so tiring instead of "adventurous" and it took me two weeks to finish three hundred pages. tiresome.
3566542760	Bloody Brilliant
4258013224	3.5Qualcuno ha detto dark academia?Ebbene sì, se amate l’aesthetic di questo genere e vi manca Harry Potter, questo romanzo per ragazzi fa al caso vostro. Un collegio inglese lontano dalla civiltà, società segrete, club di latino, padri scomparsi, misteri da risolvere… cosa si vuole di più dalla vita? Romanzi come questo ma per un target più maturo, grazie.Ebbene sì, l’estetica di questo libro è un grosso punto a favore, anche se la storia in sé parte molto lentamente e solo dopo la metà ingrana in modo interessante. Essendo scritto per un pubblico di minorenni, si concentra molto sulla vita e le turbe quotidiane dei dodicenni e solo grazie a una buona caratterizzazione del trio di turno riesce a non risultare piatto. È vero che io sono una vecchia brontolona che non avrà figli ma solo tanti gatti, ma cercate capite che intendo…Sta di fatto che io ci sarai andata volentieri al club di latino! Dato che non ho avuto l’occasione di studiarlo a scuola mi pare un buon modo per compensare.Nonostante il mio bofonchiare, lo considero un buon mistery per ragazzi. La ricerca di Emmy per scoprire cosa è accaduto a suo padre e piena di inghippi e misteri, trappole e persone senza scrupoli disposte a tutto per fermarla. L’ultima parte della storia è stata davvero avvincente, adrenalinica e mi ha incuriosita parecchio. Spero che il seguito riprenda con questo ritmo e ci offra nuovi enigmi da risolvere. Promosso!
2873388069	I've had exceptionally good luck with middle grade books recently, and Black Hollow Lane continued the trend. It would be easy to compare this one to Harry Potter: boarding school, three friends who are all kind of outcasts in their own way, a blond bully who might just need love from their parents, mysteries and misdirections, team sports factoring into the story. And if it was just that it might have been derivative. But the comparison to Harry Potter runs deeper in a way that is hard to put into words. Julia Nobel has a sense of pacing and emotional connection to the characters of the school that reminded me of my first read through of any HP novel. It was a comforting feeling - knowing that the author knows how to hit just the right cues. But enough comparing - this is a fantastic book on its own. I love the secret society angle, and bringing in medieval history and humanities into the plot of the story. I love the relationship between the characters, especially the primary 3, but also that every character had nuance to their personality and background. And I especially loved the way that some mysteries were solved in book 1, but it also opened the mystery up far wider for the series to continue. I'm 100% in to see where it goes next.
3090860508	This book gave serious harry potter vibes. A boarding school, an adventure seeking trio, a secret lane, lots of mysterious letters, suspicious teachers and a spooky student group.In my head, I was imagining every event to be happening inside Hogwarts. The Gryffindors common room. The murky and dark dungeons. The dining hall. The trio of Em, Lola and Jack seemed too similar to Harry, Hermione and Ron. The similarities were sharp.Anyways, I liked the story - A little girl in a boarding school on a whole different continent with a mysterious box full of medallions, on a mission to find out the truth about her father. It was a decent mystery but most of twists and turns were completely foreseeable. But the ending was lousy. And it ruins your reading experience in the end.
5254926159	3.75Dark academia but make it middle grade.This book instantly had my attention and was a page turner. There were a lot of things to enjoy here: a young girl sent abroad to a boarding school, a mystery surrounding her father, a secret society, evolving friendships. That being said, I wish that there had been more detail/explanation in a few parts. The pacing felt off at times as well. The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane's ending is somewhat frustrating - it wraps up some storylines but definitely has some cliffhangers. Fortunately, I had the second book (thank you library) and could start it immediately.
6433743974	3.5 starsMy brother chose this book at the bookstore and naturally, I had to read it too. As someone who loves middle grade and YA books, this was right up my alley. Super fun mystery and I have so many questions left to be answered! The plot was a unique page turner. The cover was also super cute. I only docked stars because it felt a bit young for me, I’m sure it would’ve been a five stars for little me. I might continue this series.
7616752119	Loved this one! I had DNFd the two books prior to this one so I was just looking for something fun and easy to read and this definitely fit the bill. It had just the right about of fun and mystery to keep me entertained and I devoured the entire book in a few hours. I've also already started the second book in the series. Whether you're reading this yourself of with your mid-grade age child, this one is definitely recommended for a book about friendship and adventure.
4305682441	This was a lot of fun! We meet Emmy, a feisty American preteen, that get shipped off to a British boarding school with loads of deep dark secrets in its underbelly. Loads of parallels can be drawn between this and the Harry Potter multiverse, but to be honest - this story is lovely and unique in its own way.No magic or super powers or complicated storylines but a good old school mystery for younger and mature readers set in real life.I really enjoyed it and awaiting the delivery of the second in the Julia Nobel series.Read if you need to escape and don't feel like concentrating too much.
5286918719	This was a fun, quick read. Emmy is a winning MC - not too quirky, but spunky. I also liked that her friends were fairly normal. The plot limped once in a while, but it was enjoyable, and I LOVED the boarding school setting, not to mention the references to Latin, literature, and history. On to the sequel!
3710698307	Lets say I give it 3 stars cuz it's a beginning of a series.I'm getting Harry Potter vibe all around but minus the England vibe (Harry Potter and England is unseparatable). And while I read I keep forgetting they are 12 yos. From the way they speak they basicly young adult not kiddos. Last thing is the soccer game. I'm not an avid fan but I know football. You cant possibly have 6 matches in a row for one day?? 6 times for 2x45 minutes running around 125mx85m for 12 yos?? Really? Unless its Futsal.
5912897735	Great middle grade read with memorable characters, an atmospheric boarding house setting and a solid mystery. The story flowed well and had a few surprises. Enjoyable!
6824363584	This was the quickest I’ve ever read a book I think OmgoshReview soon!

7992767384	One of those children's books that adults can equally enjoy. A very good school mystery with a dangerous secret society.
4258735283	Such a fun mystery! This is exactly what I needed right now. Love the main characters and the plot. It gives me Harry Potter/Truly Devious vibes! If you like middle grade mysteries, pick this one up!
4676578646	This was a good, clean read for middle graders. Similar to Mysterious Benedict Society but with a simpler plot. There does seem to be a bit of kids not getting adequate punishments for misbehavior, but in general this is a mild, fun read.

3832558511	3.5 this was an endearing middle grade mystery set in England. Characters were fun. Felt a bit bland in the mystery department, although this is the first book in the series and it left off on a good cliffhanger.
5030428637	Loved it! A new favorite Middle Grade. Can’t wait to read the second book in the series.
3593796408	this was ok and something probably me as a child would have lapped up. but mostly I just found it a bit cringe
2832866895	4.5 It was super fun! But the kids felt older than they were supposed to be. They were supposed to be 12 but they were acting like they were 16
4941339989	I loved the book there was lots of action in it and I could barely put it down I recommend it
2925945055	For nice American girls who longed to go to boarding school in England - it might be less fun than you think!https://perfectretort.blogspot.com/20...

5826285198	Good middle school mysteryBasically it's about Emmy being sent to a boarding school in England while her mother travels for her work. Before she left she found an old box in the attic and a note. It has something to do with het father; the mystery begins. The characters overall were interesting their. Interactions felt somewhat real. The story during the first 90% of the book moved right along and kept my interest. Unfortunately, the ending felt too abrupt and kind of week. Overall, I enjoyed the book and will give the next book in the series a try.
2866393365	A suspenseful mystery about a long kept secret society who will do practically anything to keep their existence hidden. The British boarding school setting and general snobbery of the students didn’t appeal to me as much, but I did want to keep reading to find out what happened. Ages 10 and up.
4019810592	I thought this was a really entertaining middle grades novel. I am planning on reading it aloud to my kids!
2629664194	3.5 STARS - This book piqued my interest with its beautiful cover and its setting - a British boarding school. Gotta love it! The mystery has an adventurous feel with its ancient relics, secret societies and hidden passageways but at the heart of the story is Emmy, a tween girl who has been dumped at the school by her overly busy mom but finds solace in two friends who don't mind digging into the mystery of Emmy's missing father. While Nobel brings her own unique story and characters, fans of Harry Potter will see its influence here in a few spots and whether this engages or distracts will depend on the reader. What will keep kids reading is wanting to know more about the secret society and the whereabouts of Emmy's father.As the first book in a new series, time is taken to set up the overall plot which left parts of the book (and some characters) feeling like they weren't given enough time. But now that the groundwork has been set for the series, I believe future books will focus more on the mystery and developing more well-rounded characters. Overall, this is an intriguing Middle School mystery with some darker elements but ultimately, it's a story about friendship and finding a place where you belong.Disclaimer: My sincere thanks to Sourcebooks Jabberwocky and NetGalley for providing me with a digital copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.
2332086671	Oooh, I really enjoyed this one! Young Emmy lost her father on her third birthday and her “parenting expert” mother has shipped her off to Wellsworth boarding school when her work (in the US) gets incredibly busy. Emmy struggles to blend in and eventually stumbles upon a secret society and ancient artifacts that seem related to her personal family history. I don’t want to spoil anything, but I CAN say I flew through this story. I’ve heard some think this is a Harry Potter rip-off, but I wouldn’t go that far. There are definitely similar elements, especially considering the main character is attending a boarding school in England where there are mysteries and secrets. But there’s no magic (at least so far) and the story offers enough unique components to make it its own story. I believe Harry Potter fans will dive into the charming Wellsworth world and I’m excited to continue with the series when book #2 is released!For more children's literature, middle grade literature, and YA literature reviews, feel free to visit my personal blog at The Miller Memo!
4316012146	I really wanted to like this. The set up was good: girl with absent mother and vanished father gets sent to boarding school. I really enjoyed the fact that Emmy, the main character, played soccer.Where it fell down for me is that there just wasn’t really any story. Emmy spends the first third of the book just being a good student. She does nothing except study and homework. She gets assigned to the mysterious Latin Club where she proceeds to spend the entire year sitting in the corner doing homework. What was the point of that entire plot line??When she eventually decides to start looking for her dad, we’re halfway through the book. Then all of a sudden it’s the end and the villain unmasks himself and, James Bond style, tells her the entire backstory of her dad and his entire evil plan (which consists of getting money), so she never actually finds out anything on her own.This ended up being a very poor man’s Harry Potter. Emmy even finished the book in sick bay, just like Harry. A disappointment.
