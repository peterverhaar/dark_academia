7211225354	5 stars!“Now all that was gone. This was the unbelievable fact of death. This was a paradox her mind could not accept, that someone could be in the world one moment and simply be gone the next.” I never doubt Rebecca Kuang when it comes to books. Like she can switch to any genre, write literally any storyline, but she's just so insanely talented that it never fails to capture my attention, it literally casts a spell on me, and I feel breathless when I read her books. I have read all of her books with the exception of "The Burning God' because lets be real 🧍I am not ready for the devastating blow it'll deliver but from what I have read by her, I've noticed how well researched her books are, and how they're so neatly finished like you cannot find any cracks and Katabasis like her other books followed this path. It was a different genre (Dark academia), but it was so well-researched, and I realized many times as I read this, I was simply in awe. The book felt like it was written by someone who had graduated from Oxford, Yale, and Cambridge. This book had Calculus, my worst nightmare, but the way R.F. Kuang wrote it to support the paradoxes and the logic around her world was so well done that I was secretly invested. I wanted to read more about it 😭 I felt so foreign harboring feelings like that towards Calculus, but if Miss Kuang decides to teach calculus...I'LL ENROLL. You don't understand how hard you have to try for me to like or even read something related to calculus, but I was so invested in the way she bent it to her own narrative and her own world-building. She's quite literally a mastermind. “Christ,” said Peter. “Hell is a campus.” There were a lot of criticisms that this book got when it was published, and the only one I found myself agreeing with was that it was a love story because it wasn't; it had a love story in it, but it was NOT a love story; it was so much more. Also, people criticized it for being too academic 😭 it's DARK ACADEMIA?? What do y'all expect, but even if we scratch that, it was still digestible, it was. It also wasn't like the academic part felt like a slog or dragged because the way she blended it in with the story just made the whole concept so much better, you had an idea of how everything was working because proofs were being provided and the explanation was so beautifully written within the novels constraint that it didn't feel like a "textbook" also I felt like this was way more easier to read than 'Babel' if we're talking about it being too academic. The logical demonstrations that Kuang did in the interludes were so exciting to read, and I was so bummed that they weren't filled throughout the book because I was having SOO MUCH fun reading them. “This was the key to flourishing in graduate school. You could do anything if you were delusional.” I have so much to say about this book 😭 one thing being how Rebecca writing this book made many of the readers feel like she was flaunting her three degrees because her characters are graduates in Cambridge but it quite literally the opposite of that, she highlight the criticisms of these institutions with her pen, the exploitation of students, the cruelty that was depicted and hell quite literally being Cambridge 😭😭 took me out but it was a really good way to convey that message. So, I feel like sometimes people should just actually try and see what the book is trying to convey rather than bashing it. “She gazed at Peter and thought, 'I wish I were the night, so that I might watch your sleep with a thousand eyes.” I honestly think that in the following years to come, this book will be perceived as a classic because it is a timeless classic, it has all the aspects that would give it that recognition and I know that the way she targeted institutional corruption, her take on hell so far is the best one I have seen, it's so unique and it stands so well on it's own despite drawing inspirations from others, I also loved the blend of Chinese mythology in it. “And if falling in love was discovery, was letting yourself be discovered the equivalent to being loved?” Rebecca's narrative in Katabasis refused to sit still because it transitioned from academic satire to academic seriousness. She weaved her way through the narrative, adding philosophical touches to it, and it worked in her favour. The journey that she took us on was presented to us through the present timeline and past flashbacks, and usually, I'm not that big of a fan when there's a past and present switch, but it sort of elevated the story here. The narrative that this book follows, coupled with its themes/tones and the setting itself, can be very heavy; the back and forth gave it a much-needed balance. Although the chapters were long, each of them ended up with a mini cliffhanger, which kept the pace moving; however, I would still classify this as a slow-paced book, and it's more beautiful like that, you absorb so much when you read it at the pace that it sets, the sharp twists and turns just hit you one after another. When I reached the end, I did sit and think, 'What was even the point of this book?' because there's not much that happens, but also simultaneously, there's so much that's happening. The main thing that really hit me was the factors that Alice faced. How she questioned her loyalty, how she processed her own emotions, her inner turmoil was so vividly displayed that it just made everything so much better. “Her memory did that sometimes; she confused memories and reality, her imagination was too vivid, she couldn’t help it.” Moving on to the characters, Alice Law, I have never met a character whom I have been this conflicted about because Alice Law was a very hypocritical person. I did not like her at times, but I also resonated with her at times. Reading her journey through hell was the best part of this book. The reasons why she went to hell at first didn't convince me, but as I saw more of the flashbacks and got to know more of her, the reasoning became clearer, and I was more understanding towards her. Rebecca displayed Alice's mind in this unfiltered manner, where we saw everything that happened, ALL her thoughts- the bad and the good. Her determination is a quality about her that I really liked because 😭 she literally went to hell and had no idea what to do 🧍 but I liked the way she mapped hell out and her journey, which dealt with bitterness, guilt, and confusion. I really enjoyed reading about her character. The way I wanted to kill Grimes was because of the immense torture that he put everyone through and especially her, and the reason behind it made me even more enraged. Everything that she did. All the hate and the envy that was etched into her was a consequence of Grimes' words and actions, and I will forever hate him for that, and that is perhaps why the ending was very satisfying for me. Also, she was portrayed so well 😭😭 because she was literally bartering with the king of the underworld. “I feel sometimes it is so difficult to be conscious.” Peter Murdoch. We see Peter through Alice's perspective, and through that, Peter feels very distant and unpredictable. I had no idea what to think of them because Alice was so uncertain about him and reading the book through her thoughts made me uncertain about him as well, he did come off across as a bit reckless - joining Alice on her journey to hell, the whole notebook fiasco but Peter was the exact opposite of what we made him to be and it was al because of the subtle differences that Grimes had caused between them by favoring one over the other and this was so deep rooted. Ugh, I hate Grimes. Peter's story through his own perspective (flashbacks) was very refreshing because that way we saw Peter for who he was, what he was struggling with, and his encounter with Grimes was the same as Alice's. I felt so sad for Peter tbh :(( He deserved better. “Surely no one else lived like this - burdened by the tiniest details they assumed had enormous consequences. Surely no one else was so anchored by anxiety. Other people could stumble and shake their heads and move on. How she envied their lightness.” Elspeth and Archimedes, Archimedes was the cutest, and Elspeth was just another victim of Grimes. I liked how she helped Alice see him for who he really was, but also I hate how much she was underestimated because 🙏 she was strong asf. “Meteorologically, Hell didn’t seem much worse than an English spring.” The romance, initially, when this book was announced, I thought it was going to be a romance, but to my surprise, when I got to know more about it, I knew that was not the case, and thank god for that because it helped me manage my expectations so much better!! Alice and Peter's love story was so well written, it was a subplot, but the way it bloomed was what I loved, and the fact that all of this happened in hell, LMAOO. I feel like there was so much hate-filled b/w them because of Grimes, but I liked that they worked their way through that. But honestly, them working it through that and trying to trust each other was the best art, and the humor/ banter between them was absolute gold!! “Fortunately graduate school had prepared her for this, the constant managing of despair.” The plot I'm so tired of writing this review 😭😭 and the fact that I still have so much to talk about 🤸 So, Katabasis is the descent into the underworld and is a Greek term. Katabasis literally feels like reading a half descent in myth and a half dissertation, in the best way possible, btw. The way she interwove the linguistic and philosophical aspects of this book with the plot was truly phenomenal. I have never felt this immersed. This review might have a repetitive nature because I've been writing it for the past week 😭 The plot was not just complex, it had a logical emotional reasoning. It was literally like taking a rollercoaster ride on an intellectual escapade; the paradoxes, the interludes, and the intricate magic system just elevate the entirety of the reader's experience. For me, Katabasis had a rather stagnant plot. Not much was happening, and side by side, a lot was happening. I honestly do not know how to explain that, but that literally is what it felt like reading it. You might think nothing of substance is happening, but you would also be conflicted because you would feel a lot is happening 🧍🤸 the stakes were not always high. “But of course it was worth it. It was the only thing that was worth it. She had been fortunate to find a vocation that made irrelevant everything else, and anything that made you forget to eat, drink, sleep, or maintain basic relationships—anything that made you so inhumanly excited—had to be pursued with single-minded devotion.” I think it doesn't always matter if the journey doesn't have epic action sequences or climactic situations, and Katabasis proved that. The main focus, or the main beauty of reading Katabasis, is noticing Kuang's deliberate action of making Katabasis a slow-paced book. I was truly able to appreciate this book way more this way. I was able to see that the plot was the journey itself, because at its core, it's about Alice's descent through knowledge and self-destruction. Katabasis itself is so nuanced that this kind of pacing is necessary for you to catch up on these subtle hints and understand what the plot actually revolves around. One of the main plot points was Alice and Peter discovering that hell was a campus. Highlighting how academic drive or academic ambition can be hell itself, another thing that was done very subtly was showing us how Alice was a character who had her perceptions about knowledge, academics, progress, success, and the way it was slowly peeled away for her to be met with the cold, hard truth was so brilliant to see tbh. This shows how the plot was never moving around things like entering or escaping hell; it was about what Alice felt and discovered, and how her priorities shifted; it was her experiencing something of which she had no control. “What you must realize, Alice, is that you cannot just take refuge in feminism when it suits you.” All of this doesn't negate that there were scenes of action sequences and climax, but they were not to the degree you would expect them to be. It was more about the main character unveiling the reality of the world of academia, while tackling her own personal critiques. If you want action, you will get that. Do you want plot twists? You will get that too. It's sort of filled with everything, but the amount of it in the book differs. The plot twists tbh really got me, and the chapters after the reveal were my favorite because we got so many answers!! I absolutely loved that. “Hell’s lonely,” said Peter. “You’ll want company.” “Hell is other people, I’ve heard.” I'm blabbering so much in this review 😭 but I don't want to stop because I loved it so much!!! And one thing that I loved the most about this book was its world-building and magic system, I fear I may never shut up about this part. The world that Rebecca created literally has me in awe because it's so vast, it's so well crafted, and like you could go on hours and hours dissecting it, and AHHHH you would love it because everything about it is so damn interesting and all-consuming. Rebecca Kuang's take on Hell is so different from the other interpretations despite her inspirations. So, in Kuang's version of Hell, Cambridge itself is hell. The entirety of the system fits categories that would define hell; it's served as a vivid parallel for Alice as the eight circles mirror academic corruption, and it's done so well!! Every inch of this world is a critique of the system. Kripke's symbolizes the consequences of when the intellect overpowers humanity; the Lethe, according to my interpretation, was a relief of academic stress or academic burnout. In this version of Hell, it served as a form of mercy where you could forget everything, and all the courts of hell represent the academic corruption, like the arrogance of intellect, the need for validation, exploitation, rivalry and resentment, self-destruction, autocratic control, and knowledge being weaponized. All of the parallels are so well reflected!! You can quite literally see them in the institution that Peter and Alice attend, and how vividly it mirrors hell. “Perhaps human intelligence was a mistake, and everyone who celebrated the escape from the Garden of Eden was wrong. Perhaps the gift of rationality did not outweigh the debilitating agony that came with it.” The magic system's backbone is logic, reasoning, and paradoxes. There's so much theory involved in just the magic system alone that I believe someone can write a separate book on that, and honestly, I would devour that as well, like every epic magic system, it's not perfect. It has its flaws too, which makes it so much better. The way she gives us extensive knowledge on the system she created in the form of interludes just shows how passionate Rebecca was about this world; it honestly felt like the output of a collision between Theory and logic, and it honestly was explosive. The main source of magic is done throughout the use of chalk which felt very academicy and intriguing to me 😭 so chalk is used in the real world, Alice and Peter bring it along in hell thinking it would work but upon using it on the sands of hell it would remove the work done, this formed the way the hell functions and the use of blood on chalk to perform magic for it to exist felt so fun to read!! I might be wrong on this, but I think the magic was also heavily reliant on maths, with functions and equations being used to perform. The spells worked really well that way. I love it when there's some depth, and there was extensive depth in this world's magic systems so far as to using the principle of paradox, and the very idea of that was so mind-boggling, I LOVED IT!! “The life of the mind, unfettered from commerce, was the only kind worth living.” The ending was satisfying to read, it gave me what I wanted in the most satisfying manner, and I loved that as well!!! Overall, Kuang aced this! It was my favorite read of the month, if not the year.p.s.: special thanks to areeba who proofread this entire review and corrected my mistakes for free out of the goodness of her heart.___The review is never-ending 🧍🏻 I've been writing for the past 3 days.___I don't get the hate😭 this was breathtaking.___I am feral over this already, and I'm at page 1 🧍🏻___AVON AND HARPER IM ON MY KNEES BEGGING FOR AN ARC 🙏🏻___Can we just stop what we're doing to admire this beautiful cover 🙏🏻 it's gonna look so good on my shelf!!___"Alice Law, you naughty girl. You're trying to go to hell."Just give it to me, please 😭 🙏🏻
7904884786	If nothing else, Kuang is always capable of surprising me. I did not expect to love Babel’s hefty prose as much as I did, nor did I expect to find Yellowface as unfunny as it was. Katabasis is unique in that it is bereft of anything particularly good or bad. It is nothing. Here, Kuang asks the question, what if every account of Hell was based on real experiences? What if Dante really traveled to the nine circles? What if Aeneas actually crossed the river styx? What if you read an entire book solely dedicated to the author showing off how much they read? A full half of this book (more, to be honest) is nothing more than Kuang desperately trying to remind the reader that she is smart. She knows T.S. Elliot and Michael Huemer. She understands Blaise Pascal and August Ferdinand Möbius’ theories. Nietzsche and John Bancroft? Child’s play. When characters aren’t busy info dumping about a dead philosopher (or mathematician, or logician, or theorist, or just some random guy), the narrator does it for them. I cannot emphasize this enough. This is not a case like Babel, where she included quite a bit of context and explanations for languages, histories, and general events. Here, the entire narrative comes to a screeching halt every five seconds so she can explain Schrödinger‘s cat to us. It quite literally reads like a textbook where the actual storyline is only added in to stop you from putting it down. It is so boring. I must clarify (because some people have clearly misconstrued my words) that I do not have a problem with a dark academia book doing what dark academia books do. Again, and I cannot stress this enough, I really enjoyed Babel. I thought the weaving in of history and her personal knowledge was creative and fun. I have a problem with how goddamn boring this book was. Every single new reference made me groan out loud because all it did was take away from the actual plot. This is exactly the type of book that will have people online claiming they were “too dumb” to understand it (this is, somehow, used as a compliment!). I am here to tell you that you are not in any way lacking in intelligence if you cannot understand the insane amount of slop in here. It is not a positive attribute that the author threw together a bunch of random academia bullshit in the same way that millennials insert Harry Potter references into their books. Frankly, once you look past all of the philosophy, the writing is quite juvenile. It actually shocked me quite a bit. My main praise for Babel was the writing. I thought, even if Kuang isn’t the most elaborate with her prose (she’s usually a very straightforward writer, which I like), it was still a beautiful love letter to languages. Katabasis reads like a Tumblr post.Consider: “You know very well what a heap is. You know it when you see it. It is like porn.” (Apparently a reference, but so random in context that it sounds silly) “You couldn’t just decide you didn’t like being punished and nope back out into Limbo.” (Nope as a verb???)Not a quote, but worth noting that the Hell described in this book is not only unimaginative but actively irrelevant to the course of events. The characters, whom I haven’t brought up at all until now, are insufferable. This certainly tracks with Kuang’s record, as she is really quite good at writing frustrating protagonists (this is a compliment). I liked Alice! Peter, not so much. Feels a bit ironic that I said there wasn’t anything either good or bad when I’ve gone on for so long about the writing, but I do want to make it clear that I do not actually feel any way about this book. It is strangely written with an alright story that is interesting at times and, more often than not, uninspired. It is merely fine. Not great, like The Poppy War. Not awful, like The Burning God. I will forget I read it in a week. Review in exchange for an advanced reader’s copy.Edited Sept. 2025 for clarification.

R.F. Kuang's premise, a postgraduate in analytic magick, Alice Law, and her fellow Peter Murdoch embarking on a perilous journey through the eight courts of Hell to retrieve Professor Jacob Grims, held immense promise. The initial setup, the chalk-drawn pentagram, and the evocative descriptions of the oppressive weather and the chilling architecture of Hell, painting a vivid and compelling tableau.However, the immersive atmosphere was frequently obscured by an overabundance of descriptive detail. Kuang's prose, while often beautiful, became a dense fog, making it difficult to maintain focus and follow the narrative's thread. The emphasis on Peter Murdoch's backstory, while intriguing, often overshadowed Alice Law's journey in the first helf of the book , leaving her character somewhat underdeveloped. Peter, the aloof yet seemingly empathetic magician, held the reader at arm's length, creating an emotional disconnect that I found frustrating. Alice's attempts to bridge this gap, to truly understand him, were compelling, but often felt thwarted by the narrative's focus on Peter's internal landscape ,It is worth noting that Alice does take a pivotal role in the final chapters, demonstrating her agency and importance within the story.The enemies-to-lovers trope, a point of significant interest, delivered moments of both captivating tension and jarring incongruity. Certain twists were genuinely unpredictable, eliciting a visceral shock that propelled me forward. However, the initial motivation for the descent into Hell remained shrouded in a perplexing ambiguity, leaving me feeling disoriented rather than intrigued.Kuang's integration of philosophical and mathematical concepts, while intellectually stimulating, often felt like a display of academic prowess rather than a seamless narrative element. The author's rapid-fire exposition, jumping between complex ideas without sufficient contextualization, left me feeling intellectually inadequate. While a good book should challenge the reader, Katabasis occasionally veered into didacticism, creating a sense of distance rather than engagement.In conclusion, Katabasis is a work of undeniable ambition and intellectual depth. Kuang's ability to craft a dark and atmospheric world, including the detailed building and oppressive weather, is evident, and the narrative's unexpected twists are genuinely compelling. However, the overreliance on dense description, the uneven pacing, and the occasional feeling of being talked down to ultimately prevented me from fully immersing myself in the story. While I commend Kuang's willingness to tackle complex themes and push the boundaries of genre, I ultimately felt that the narrative's potential was not fully realized. I would recommend this book to readers who appreciate intellectually challenging fantasy and are willing to navigate a dense and sometimes perplexing narrative, but with the caveat that it demands patience and a willingness to grapple with its complexities.𝙋.𝙎: some quotes I loved :* I wish I were the night, so that I might watch your sleep with a thousand eyes.* You thought the world was one way and then it wasn’t. One could become zero. One could become two.* Everyone else lived in such an ossified world. They simply took the rules given to them.* An unexamined life is not worth living, as Socrates tells us.* Goodbyes were worth the effort only when you meant to see someone again.-Guess who got the arc 🤭
7162525001	4.5⭐️ “Hell is a classroom”Wow wow wow. I absolutely adored this book!! And this is why I will always say go into books with an open mind, especially popular new releases with A LOT of differing opinions. I know a lot of people didn’t like this book and found it to be too info dumpy and reads like a textbook with all of its literary references and philosophical underpinnings, and honestly that take is entirely valid. I totally understand by people either love or hate this book and I just so happened to be in the camp that LOVE IT!!!I think one of the main reasons why I loved this so much is that it resonated with me so so deeply. As someone who spend 6 years in higher education, who thrived off academic validation and for praise and approval from my professors, being in Alice’s head made me feel so seen and heard. RF. Luang really said, hey, all of you who have ever lost yourself to the need for perfection and approval in the world academia, who sacrificed your mental and physical well being to the point where you don’t even recognizing yourself anymore… I see you and I hear you. And GOD did I feel seen. Reading this made me feel like a student again and brought back so many memories both good and bad, it was quite healing.I adored this plot, it sucked me right in! The parallels and prose and depth to this world and these characters made it so easy for me to so deeply invested in the story right away. Peter and Alice have my whole heart, their romance (though subtle) was perfect, this is everything I want from rivals to lovers. This is also EVERYTHING I WANT from dark academia. This is also exactly how I prefer to read a soft magic system. The magic is there and it’s intriguing and easy to understand and fit into the world, yet it is not used to solve problems and accelerate the plot. Some people might not like this aspect but it’s perfect for me.The depression representation too!!! Don’t even start with me, it was so perfect it actually made me emotional because of how much I related to Alice’s struggles. This is the type of mental health rep I want from books. “She was not one of the depressives who lay stinking in bed; she could not just lie there, the stillness hurt worse. Moving staved the agony.“Two lost, damaged souls, unknowing victims of the same trauma, with minds so big it can be overwhelming, wander to hell together to bring back their professor…. What could go wrong?“I wish I were the night, so that I might watch your sleep with a thousand eyes.”
7058082846	Some books are too magnificent to simply be described—they must be devoured and savored slowly to fully appreciate their brilliance. This is one of them—a spellbinding blend of enemies-to-lovers romance and dark academia fantasy, featuring a mind-blowing journey through hell, where every level embodies sins like pride, desire, greed, wrath, and tyranny, alongside the infamous City of Dis. The story weaves together elements of mathematics, philosophy, and religion, enriched with fascinating anecdotes from Ancient Greek mythology.Alice Law, an ambitious and brilliant mind in Cambridge’s Magick field, accidentally kills her mentor by misdrawing a pentagram. Determined to bring him back, she embarks on a dangerous quest to hell—only to be joined by her arch-nemesis (and former crush), Peter Murdoch. Their mentor, Grimes, could be anywhere in the underworld, and as they navigate its treacherous levels, they encounter terrifying entities, battle monstrous creatures, and undergo hell’s grueling trials.Trapped in a relentless race against time, Alice and Peter must confront their tangled past, wavering between love and hate, while guarding dark secrets that could destroy them. The deeper they descend, the greater the danger—not just of losing their lives but of succumbing to the underworld itself. If their secrets come to light, will they escape hell unscathed, or will they be doomed to wander its eternal abyss, their memories erased forever?Overall: Words cannot capture how much I adored this book—it’s not just my favorite fantasy of the year but possibly the best book I’ve read all year! With its sharp academic wit, themes of abuse, existential questioning, self-respect, and the infinite choices that shape our lives, this novel masterfully blends intellectual depth with an addictive rivals-to-lovers romance. I can’t recommend it enough—add it to your reading list immediately, and prepare to be enthralled by its intricate, mysterious, and utterly unputdownable adventure.A huge thank you to NetGalley, Avon, and Harper Voyager for providing a digital review copy of this masterpiece in exchange for my honest thoughts!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter
6788705183	→ boring as Hell, pun intended ←after deeming Babel a masterpiece, i had such high hopes for Katabasis. i don’t feel like putting you through an overly long review of my thoughts. let’s make this easy. (i’ve read enough over-explaining in this book to last a lifetime, so i won’t do the same to you.) ┏━━━━━❂ the issues ❂━━━━━┓✦ tedious + exhausting to read✦ the mathematics, logic, and geography were all wayyyy over-explained. we know you’re smart but i don't want to read a textbook. nor do i know who any of these people you're referencing are. i’m not going to go do a significant amount of research to enjoy a fantasy book. ✦ Alice was EXTREMELY unlikable✦ long-winded and unnecessarily wordy. extremely textbook-like for long stretches at a time✦ boring (!) the first two courts were creative and then it went downhill from there✦ the most dull, underdeveloped characters. we don’t even know what they look like besides their hair colors. and we only learn Alice’s hair color around PAGE 300. they lack personality, as well. ✦ the entire book gave off a ”holier than thou” vibe. like if you didn’t understand something or earn a PhD, you weren’t *worthy* of reading this book. ✦ the time jumps were very disjointed✦ our storyline was so non-linear i had to remind myself which court of hell we were in and i just ended up not caring✦ Peter was just… dull✦ none of this shit was worth losing half a lifetime. none of this shit was worth wasting however many hours i did dragging myself through this. if you disagree with me — good for you! i completely understand people who have read this book and believe it is brilliant. … but be nice. do i really need to remind adults on the internet that reading is subjective? i hope not.
7861739495	Edit: Just prefacing this review with something I believe should be obvious, but apparently is not to the vast majority: I DO NOT condone senselessly hating on any author. If your criticism comes from a place of personal malice toward the author, best keep that rubbish to yourself. This one-star review reflects Kuang as a writer, not as a person. Thank you.Dear Rebecca,What went so wrong in my love for you, hm? Did I not find you an untested, unpolished author and pass you with flying colours? Did I not defend you against the rightful arguments that your debut novel—The Poppy War—was simply a fantastic, banal caricature of the Sino-Japanese War? Did I not disregard the fact that, if you stripped the entirety of The Poppy War trilogy off of its fantastic elements, it would assume the face of a history book—because you, like an insentient mimeograph, copied word for word actual historical events and shoved them into your novel, believing in your hubris that the average reader wasn’t capable of pointing out these acts of plagiarism?You were good, Rebecca. Not great, but good. You had potential. You could create. And I loved you. I really did.Then came Babel. What a marvel it was; in didacticism, repetition, and blatant slights to the reader’s intelligence. You badgered me, prodded at my patience, fed me your opinions as facts, and I could have forgiven it all in the name of love if you hadn’t broken the one, very, very sacred promise a writer makes to their reader: I will not think for you, dear reader.But you did.Colonialism. What a concept. You wanted to speak to us of the bane of society, of the plague my ancestors endured, of the bloodied trains that carried my family from Kashmir to Punjab after the British were done ravaging our lands—leaving us bitter with a perennial animosity when once we were an amiable lot. But despite my familiarity with this sickness, you didn’t trust me with it. You thought me deaf and dumb and blind. You believed that, unless you repeated the same idea a million times, I would not admit it into my thick brain. You thought of me as the British once did: a lesser race.For a few long moments, I became disillusioned with you. In a childish tantrum I unfollowed you on Instagram, only to follow you right back the next day. I took a deep breath. Babel was your mistake. You were human, and I found it my duty to forgive you. And forgive I did.But now you’ve made the same mistake with Katabasis. You wrote sentences like, “You know very well what a heap is. You know it when you see it. It is like porn.” You called magic magick. You introduced me to two insufferable characters who my friends and I would gladly bludgeon to death with hammers. Alice Law is a self-insert. I know. Peter Murdoch is your fiancé-insert. I know that too. You’d actually be surprised at how much I know, if you actually cared about your reader.I didn’t want Socrates, Rebecca. I didn’t want Plato, Archimedes, Pythagoras, Dante, or Virgil. I wanted you. But you’re so incredibly busy trying to make sure I remember you went to Oxford, Cambridge, and Yale. You’re shaking me violently by the shoulders and screaming, “I’M SMART! I’M SMART! I’M SMART!” And your book suffers for it. I can believe you are a smart student, Rebecca, but never that you are a smart writer.Katabasis is regressive, doctrinal, and autocratic. It is a fool’s guide to hell. It has no flair, no true emotion, nothing to say that the reader doesn’t already know. It looks busy while doing nothing. Alice is Robin from Babel. Robin is Rin from The Poppy War. Rin is Alice from Katabasis. Nothing separates one character from another. My brevity and sense of literary propriety are failing me the longer I try to pen my thoughts about Katabasis.Rebecca, you made hell boring. Hell. BORING. What is wrong with you? Why must you torture me like this? Should I fall to my knees, press my cheek against your feet, and beg for mercy because I didn’t get a master’s degree from Oxford or Cambridge, nor pursued a doctorate at Yale? Is that my crime? Is the real crime not the fact that you are conceited in your belief that the average reader is stupid, while you are so incredibly smart, and that’s why you must hammer the nails of exposition into our skulls instead of doing what the better writer does—showing instead of telling?Rebecca. Oh, Rebecca. We will never be friends again. We won’t even be acquaintances. The only natural relationship I can see us forming is that of foes. What a shame. I don’t think you’ll ever change, and I know that I can’t love you like this.So this is goodbye. I leave you to the BookTok masses, to the timorous, vociferating few who’ll claim, “Katabasis wasn’t for you because you’re ignorant/stupid/sterile/unimaginative/hateful,” and to those who’ll never know how I loved you once.I’m sorry—and please know—it wasn’t me. It was you.Yours, (although not anymore, I suppose)Waniya.

7553857127	This must be annoying. If a non-fan got an ARC by one of my favorite authors just to shit all over it, I would be annoyed. I would think, they just don't get it. So there! I've done my due diligence, I've walked a solid mile or so in those shoes, and maybe... maybe I just don't get it.Entertained yet underwhelmed by the depth of Yellowface, I itched to read more Kuang. I was sure deeper intellectual criticism was bound to find me in her other works. So how divinely guided must I have been to watch an ARC of the shiny, glittering Katabasis fall right into my lap! (Thank you Harper Voyager and all those at Shelves & the City... all press is good press right?). I didn't move a muscle. Here it was, BookTok's most anticipated read in the year of our Lord 2025. Touching my hands! Oh! All of its glory! Long minutes passed, and I broke free of my paralytic spell. Yes, my loves, with shaking fingers, I cracked open those fresh pages... and read. My eyes gloss over “naughty girl." Hm. No matter, this is fine. Kuang's first foray into romance will have its bumps, so I'll be forgiving of rookie replications. I continue—oh, woah! Would you believe it, within the first chapter, spells are cast, and straight into hell we go. All right! Although unexpected, I'm geared for a fast paced ride! What do you have in store for me, Ms. Kuang? The short story? Disappointment. The long story? Read on, man. I'll spare you the dramatics for the rest, but as some of you may know... from a TikTok video I made at the halfway reading point... three main gripes arose. While I stand by these, I plan on exploring them further in the context of the finished book. Girlsss, introduce yourselves now:1. prose2. fact over fun3. character developmentBeginning with #1: prose, I often find myself unimpressed with the typical BookTok favorites populating that table in Barnes & Noble, so this is run of the mill. But knowing Kuang, watching her interviews, and learning her authorial inspirations, I think her style attempts to replicate some literary darlings. Yet it falls flat on its face. Here: although not a constant, many paragraphs hold entire sentences following the formula of "subject verb object." I present an example: "He tumbled the last meter but landed all in one piece. Alice jumped down beside him and landed sprightly on her feet. This hurt her heels, but she had a silly urge to impress Peter," and on it goes. Since I'm a freak, I know Didion inspires Kuang. Since Kuang's a freak, I know she'll read this review, but that's besides the point. Didion has a similar approach, as she commonly follows the "subject verb object" formula, but what differentiates the two is where the rest of the sentence flows from its primordial beginning. While Kuang adheres to parallelism (and maybe that's intentional, hey props to you, girl!), Didion lets each sentence flow a different direction. That's the variation that makes the reading experience more enjoyable to me, at least. Each sentence may start the same, but they end up somewhere else. See, Kuang lacks this diverse flow, and for that, I find it difficult to savor.Oh, my reader friends, but to say it's the worst would be to lie! It’s not the worst. It is fine. Again, I've been reading too many impressive books that I now assume something tame must disappoint. So if this is no problem for you,read on, man.(This is a reference to Sophie Kemp's Paradise Logic btw. Idk if you can tell I'm obsessed. Sorry to bring up another book in the middle of this review... she's the other woman...)Numero Dos! or #2, as the English would say. Fact. Over. Fun. While my initial criticisms under this number were typical, I have a bit more to share. See, a lot of Kuang's critics share their aversion to her exposition dumps, but seeing as I have nothing to compare this to but Yellowface, I'm not sure if Katabasis is better or worse than, say, Babel. I think the latter two are closer sisters than the former. Since all I know is Katabasis, I’ll look at it as an isolated case study. We dive in. Her integration of exposition (all the research she did on hell) is lazy. It is not tightly bound to the plot, it is loose. Unfortunately, Kuang herself is aware of this: "She wasn't sure her ramblings made any sense—it was all a jumble of associated concepts flung together from days of frenzied research" (326). Yeah I just cited that. Kuang rationalizes her poorly constructed research integration by projecting her own writing struggles onto her characters. Ooh that was a claim. Okay sorry, I'll level the playing field, so we can get one thing straight: everyone is impressed with Kuang's research talents. Everyone is impressed that she takes research to fiction! But it's like the RuPaul's Drag Race talent shows: you can have a talent, but if you can't integrate it into your drag, it will flop. Research should likewise be integrated into fiction. But alas! This is a misuse of medium.While I'm not a fan of the major expo dump in the first hundred pages, like any other fantasy, it improves as the chapters progress. Yet, the dip in exposition is not met with a rise in... well... FUN! I'm majorly upset with the fact that hell was simply not fun!This is not by design. Little background: Kuang writes hell as a mirror of Cambridge, insinuating that any living visitor will see hell reflected in their own life, or vice versa, however you wanna put it. Sweeping past the plot holes this introduces, that's an interesting set-up! Imagine what Alice and Peter could get into! Lol. Are you imagining? Yeah. It's cool right? Now erase all of that because none of it happens.The biggest challenges Alice and Peter face are almost instantly resolved by a convenient third party. It keeps happening! Matter of fact, I counted each time Alice said, "could it be this easy?" and for those who own the copy, they're on pages 145, 257, and 398. I don't know, Kuang, it could be easy if you want to write it easy. But at some point, the reader (me) becomes frustrated with the little struggle in these obstacles. They become frustrated that so many advances are earned quite... uh, how do you say... EASILY! Like your ending! Oh, no. Nope. I can't think about the ending or else I'm gonna start twitching in this here library where I write this review.All right now, all this talk of fun in plot, what about fun in MIND? Is the book intellectually stimulating? I'd admit it depends on how you define the term. At risk of sounding pretentious (I've already sped way past that point), it seems I have a threshold higher than the average Kuang fan. Undeniably, my biggest dissatisfaction with Kuang is the immediate interpretations of her own story. This sharp delivery lent itself well to Yellowface, because it was a satire! Her guided direction worked itself into the comedy of the piece. Yet in the context of a fantasy, in the context of Katabasis, this overbearing Kuangian voice infiltrates all! I find that any interesting questions Kuang introduces (and there are many!) are answered within pages. Please girl, let me think for myself.This is not exploration, this is rhetoric. Bombastic rhetoric, even. Harken back to the beginning of this review, I was so insanely, graciously lucky to attend Shelves & the City, where fate led me to hear Kuang speak on a panel. Thank heavens! She is such a great speaker! But she said one thing there, and it's been racking my brain ever since I finished Katabasis. It is (paraphrased), "I don't want to tell anyone how to think. I just want to explore the questions that keep me up at night." Oh. Well. Holy f*cking airball, as they say. I recall the most common defense Kuang fans tout, which argues that her sharp delivery effectively communicates her message. Then I compare that to her claim above, and there's an obvious disconnect. The one thing on which Kuang lovers and haters agree is that she's direct. And there she was saying that she is not. So is she missing something? Am I missing something? Maybe she knows her bombastic rhetoric is... bombastic? Her commentary on women in academia is repetitive, tiresome. I wonder who she writes for. If it's meant to be a Cambridge circle jerk, then they already know this. But if it's meant to be for us plebeians, then she must think lowly of our interpretative skills. At the end of the day, it's not a crime to be direct. But it is a minor offense to lie... and the punishment? How about bombast for bombast? I decree to Kuang the sentence of......... BOMBASTIC side eye!!!! Lmfao sorry to bring that one up ewwww that's kinda cringe sorry. But it was right there.If you're not totally disgusted by that display, then,read on, man. #3 and at this point I'm getting tired I kinda just wanna finish this. I’m not getting paid. Okay so 3 was character development. What I originally said in my TikTok was that we didn't know anything about the characters in the first half, making it painful to trudge through. And well yes! We do get more character info, but only in flashbacks to Alice and Peter at Cambridge. We never quite see it in play. You know the whole "show, don't tell" thing? Kuang forgot about it writing Katabasis. The one time she showed (didn’t tell) was that stellar chapter on Alice and Peter’s strikingly intimate relationship. I yearn for more. Because most often, the reader can not make their own judgement before she steps in. I guess that's par for the course! Praise be the day Kuang realizes that too. That's really all I have to say on that.When it comes to good things, I wonder if I've spent so much time being negative that I've completely lost the light. Ummmm lemme rummage around in here for a bit. Um. Ooh. No not that. Hmmm. Nope. Ooh. Nuh uh. Ahh! Okay. Parallels between Peter and Alice were lovely! They both have characteristics that make them susceptible to exploitation. How satisfying was that. I do think it would have meant more if we weren’t given crumbs up until some of Peter’s lore dropped. But that’s debatable. And I do love a parallel. I do love it.And another. All the pieces tied up together at the end, ending with a final reflection on how precious life is! That was quite sweet! Yes yes, I liked how it all came together. The story seemed to be heading that way the entire time, though, lol, like it was quite obvious even when Alice was thinking otherwise. Alice was not very convincing in her stance, but maybe that's why it was so easily changed over the course of this book. Now I know that's just how it goes.I always want to give an author two chances to see if they vibe with me, and now that I've done that, I know I'll be sitting the rest of Kuang's stuff... out. (I also posted a TikTok on the plot holes of the magic system, but that's gratuitous. For those who are curious, I push you there)Hope that was elucidating. Hope I wasn't too hateful. Hope Kuang won't subtweet me in her next book. Thank you for reading :)***Post-script: it’s release day so I’m thinking of Kuang. What frustrates me most between Katabasis and Yellowface are her “nuanced” characters. Although Alice may fall prey to the system, although June may hold racist beliefs, neither of them are convicted. There is only surface-level stereotyping of alternate thought, rather than true investigation. A powerful writer would challenge their own and their reader’s beliefs, consider how the opponent is right, and return to beginning, with better tools for combat. To fight, you must know your enemy. Yet Kuang dismisses them. Writes them as caricatures. I do not believe this is effective fiction. It is rhetoric masquerading as fiction. I almost always agree with Kuang’s beliefs, but what I wish her to ask me, through written word, is… why? Why do I agree?I wonder if the value of a book lies in its storytelling or its message. Maybe some readers only prioritize the message. I want a story. Maybe I’m only upset because my fellow readers endlessly sing her praises, and I can’t see it. I have to pick apart the pieces. Say, let’s take the piece where she writes caricatures of enemies. I ask myself, why does this not work? Kurt Vonnegut does the same, and I accept it. Why do I find it funny when he does it? Well, I guess I found it funny in Yellowface. Maybe it’s because these two lean satirical? But outside of the satire medium, Kuang continues to do this! Does it still work in a fantasy? Or is something else required of the genre? I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about what makes fiction good. Or maybe it’s a subjective experience and I’m wasting all this time.Well! Whatever. Kuang announced her next book, and she’s coming for my preferred genre of litfic… we will see how her style lends itself out there.

6679825160	Why Katabasis Doesn’t Work R.F. Kuang has built her reputation on sharp, ambitious novels that interrogate power, colonialism, and language in a way that felt both urgent and original. Even when polarizing, her books usually succeeded in provoking meaningful conversation. Katabasis, however, represents a startling departure, not because it risks too much, but because it risks so little. It takes a premise as rich as a descent into hell and reduces it to a derivative, unimaginative, and often offensive narrative.The significance of this failure lies not only in the book itself, but in what it suggests about Kuang’s trajectory as a writer.1. Trigger Warnings and the Ethics of Shock ValueOne of the first and most glaring issues is the book’s reliance on disturbing content for impact. Katabasis introduces a long catalogue of triggers: animal cruelty, eating disorders (“She was very proud of the days that she forgot to eat…”), child murder, bestiality, gore, sexism, suicidal ideation, lesbophobia, gaslighting, sexual harassment, and more. Yet none of these are thematically developed or given narrative weight. They are presented, often graphically, then abandoned.This reliance on shock value reveals a fundamental problem: the book confuses provocation with depth. Literature can and should engage with disturbing realities, but it carries an ethical responsibility to do so with purpose and care. In Katabasis, these moments function as spectacle, not critique. Instead of illuminating power, suffering, or ideology, they leave the reader with revulsion and little else.2. Alice and the Repetition of Misogyny Alice, the protagonist, epitomizes another failure. Her voice is abrasive not in a complex, thought-provoking way, but in a manner that forecloses engagement. She sneers at activists, despises other women, and reduces feminism to caricature. The most telling lines “She couldn’t stand those screeching activists who believed the only politically just thing was to become a lesbian.” “The best way to prove women were not inferior was just to not be inferior.”read less like the construction of a flawed but challenging character than as unexamined ventriloquism of misogynistic discourse. This is particularly troubling because it repeats a pattern across Kuang’s oeuvre. Her women often emerge as hostile to solidarity, dismissive of activism, or antagonistic toward their own sex. In Babel, such a stance was contextually coherent and ultimately challenged. In Katabasis, it is neither contextualized nor interrogated. The misogyny stands largely unopposed, raising the question: why is this the third time in four books that Kuang has turned to this trope? When repetition becomes pattern, it begins to reflect less on the characters and more on the limits of the authorial imagination.3. The Failure of Setting and World-BuildingA descent into hell carries immense literary and cultural weight. From Dante to Milton, from Bosch’s paintings to modern fantasy, hell is a space where theology, morality, and imagination converge. In Katabasis, however, hell is disappointingly superficial. What should be a site of philosophical, religious, and mythological resonance is reduced to aesthetic borrowing: Dantean gestures, Mad Max wastelands, The Atlas Six-style magic.The absence of religious or cultural depth suggests not only a lack of research, but also a missed opportunity. Hell, by definition, is never neutral; it is always entangled with systems of belief, punishment, and morality. To strip it of this context is to render it generic. Compared with works like The Saint of Heartbreak, which explores hell with nuance and empathy even when it is not the central subject, Kuang’s hell appears unimaginative, less a site of meaning than a backdrop for spectacle.4. Romance and Character FlatnessThe marketing of Katabasis as a romance further compounds its failure. Peter is inert, his twist neither surprising nor transformative. The relationship between him and Alice lacks chemistry, intimacy, or narrative function. What emerges is not romance but proximity dressed up as intimacy. More than that, it exposes a weakness in Kuang’s writing: she has never attempted romance seriously before, and here it becomes clear why. The novel confuses proximity with connection and marketability with emotional investment.More broadly, the novel suffers from a collapse of subtle characterization. We are told Alice seeks validation. We are told she believes herself superior. We are told how to read her. What is lost is ambiguity, space for interpretation, or the beauty of implication. Where Babel married lush prose with complexity, Katabasis settles for blunt exposition.5. The Problem of AudienceThe most revealing flaw in Katabasis is its lack of a clear target audience. The novel gestures toward many readerships but satisfies none: - Too academic for a general audience, yet too shallow for readers steeped in classical or theological traditions. - Marketed as a romance, yet offering none of the emotional or narrative beats of the genre. - Potentially aimed at fans of hell-as-setting, yet doing nothing new.This tension reveals something about Kuang herself. She has often drawn heavily from her academic training, with Babel showcasing the brilliance and the pitfalls of this approach. In Katabasis, however, the academic bubble becomes a cage. The novel reads as though designed more to demonstrate cleverness than to engage readers. The result is a work that is alienating without being profound, academic without being rigorous.6. Resolution Without ConsequenceIf the novel spends much of its time mired in provocation, its ending swings abruptly in the opposite direction. The resolution is oddly simplistic, almost Disney-like in its moral clarity: the “good” prevail, the “bad” are punished, and the toxicity of academia is neutralized. This undercuts whatever complexity the novel might have gestured toward. For a writer known for her refusal to offer easy answers, this tidy resolution feels especially hollow.7. The Larger Question: Why Does This Book Exist?All of this leads to the central problem: Katabasis lacks purpose. It does not advance mythology in new directions, it does not interrogate misogyny with depth, it does not develop its disturbing content into critique. It offers spectacle, but not meaning.For an author who has positioned herself as a serious voice in contemporary literature, interrogating empire in The Poppy War and language in Babel, this regression is striking. Katabasis is not ambitious, but hollow; not daring, but careless. What once distinguished Kuang was her ability to weave influences into something distinctively her own. If earlier works invited readers to wrestle with questions of power and morality, this one invites little more than frustration and disgust.What does it mean for an author like Kuang to fail in this way?Katabasis is not a failure of excess, but of imagination. It does not stumble because it reaches too far, but because it settles for the shallow, the derivative, the shock-for-shock’s-sake.As part of Kuang’s trajectory, this matters. She has established herself as a writer who interrogates systems of power, empire, language, colonialism, academia. But with Katabasis, the critique collapses. Misogyny is repeated but not interrogated. Disturbing content is invoked but not explored. Hell is evoked but not imagined. Even academia, the one theme Kuang does know intimately, is reduced at the end to a simplistic moral victory.The result is not simply a disappointing novel. It is a work that calls into question whether Kuang, at this stage in her career, has become trapped within her own academic frame of reference, mistaking spectacle for substance and provocation for profundity. If The Poppy War was her confrontation with empire, and Babel her meditation on language, then Katabasis should have been her descent into the underworld of meaning itself. Instead, it is an empty masquerade, a regression that leaves wondering whether the author who once dared to unsettle us has been replaced by someone content to imitate herself.

7870149271	so, like colleen hoover for people who are in grad school.before anyone comes banging down my door to say "YOU'RE HATING JUST TO HATE!" yes, this is my first r.f. kuang book, yes i've heard she's prone to autofiction + didacticism, yes i know she wrote her first book at 19 (something i've famously criticized chloe gong for), HOWEVER—i read the recent new yorker profile and was immediately sold. i found a lot to admire in kuang's humility + work ethic, and felt i'd waited for the right moment to finally pick up one of her books. i think we revere male authors for much less (see also: haruki murakami's 5am writing sprints, followed by real sprints in service of the next pair of manic pixie dream breasts). i also found the narrative thread about kuang's husband, his precarious health, and her caretaker role very (bitter)sweet (i'm trying to be more open-minded about autofiction trends). i was only slightly skeptical after learning she'd never written anything creatively until college when she gave up debate club, sat down to pump out the poppy war, and the rest—as they say—was history. this context is important because i went into katabasis ready to love it. and i did! for about 5 seconds. what i will say about kuang that i can't about gong is there's at least line-level skill being exhibited here. no, kuang isn't the talentless hack that colleen hoover is (despite my earlier joke) and no, she's not writing soapy airport slop that'll go on to inflame future celebrity lawsuits (knock on wood). i can see kuang is enthralled by her own projects and that she cares a lot about her research. this is, for the record, a great skill to have as a writer, and one we should encourage.i can see also that for the average non-readerly reader who subsists on an (imbalanced) diet of automatic nyt bestsellers (ana huang, rebecca yarros, SJM), katabasis will feel literary by contrast, maybe even too smart to warrant its popularity. the near-constant references will confuse, confound, and (less often) impress. the non-readerly will either be uninterested or dazzled. they'll feel too dumb for kuang or they'll feel like they picked up a philosophical textbook, that having slogged through 500 pages of intertextual monologues, they've proven their mettle and can finally call themselves suitably intellectual. this is, for them, the Peak.(i'm defining 'non-readerly reader' as: anyone who gets their recommendations from influencers; anyone whose eyes glaze over during narrative description + who longs to skip ahead to dialogue; anyone who stares into space when asked to name an independent press or a poet who doesn't post their drafts on instagram; people who live for trends, for concepts, for tiktok authors, people for whom books are mere vehicles on the way to movie/tv adaptations, yes this is derogatory)having finally finished a kuang book, i can safely say katabasis is largely middling, absolutely average in concept and execution, the result of a lifetime spent chasing external validation through rhetorical feints + flourishes (that debate club track record is all over this project), an unexceptional, boilerplate genre submission that will have tried & true SFF fans raising their eyebrows until it's no longer being pushed by bookstore displays. katabasis is neither too stupid nor too smart. it hits almost every beat needed to appeal to the widest possible net of readers. it's commercial genre fiction masquerading as literary (remember we're living through a literacy crisis rn....back in my day, we were spending the near-decade between every donna tartt release pioneering the dark academia niche with our own tumblr drafts). i can maybe see a world where we categorize kuang as aspirationally 'upmarket' (her work is more intellectually robust than taylor jenkins reid's, less so than suzanne collins'. what does it say that collins' YA genre fiction is more clever than katabasis?). in other words, i'm NOT here to fault the book for its jargon or references. i'm well aware kuang is pretentious and so is she (she apparently self-identifies as such). i love work that's unapologetically stuck-up—if and only if writers go all out, with no care for commercial viability or mass audience appeal. this isn't that. this is a 'living out my latent harry potter fantasies at cambridge!' starter pack—except kuang couldn't decide how or when to deliver her jargon. occasionally, we get italicized "interlude" chapters ("On Reincarnation," "On Chalk") from some yet-unexplained, all-knowing world-building source. i could get behind this concept if kuang had funneled all her heaviest world-building into these little chapters, and if they cropped up regularly, resolutely, & in a way that tied into subsequent plot elements. but the interludes drop off, then vanish for no rhyme or reason. in all the worst ways, katabasis is reflective of an outdated, institutionally-backed vanity. because it's an oxford- and cambridge-endowed vanity (literally, fictionally, meta-referentially), the social fabric of her world is overwhelmingly male. i don't just mean alice is defending her misogynistic, sexually abusive mentor (even blushing over him!) until the very last pages of the book (that plotline is its own can of worms). i mean every bit of scholarship, every philosopher & poet used to build out the world of the novel, comes from a canon of majority white men. katabasis is tasked with walking the unfortunate line between "this is social commentary on the abusive, white, misogynistic nature of academia!" AND, "this book is replicative of every awful system of power in academia!" the result is a confused, uninventive, flatly padded jail cell—really, kuang's world is nothing short of a glorified, self-obsessed seclusion room—passed off as Hell, capital H. the biodiversity? nonexistent. the ensemble cast? largely harmless, immaterial NPCs. we get sand, bones, sand, some white college buildings, sand, cobblestone, sand, some more sand, bones except now they bite but not too much because they need to be easily defeated lest they threaten the hero status of our main characters, more sand, more bone creatures but kuang already expended too many brain cells on her last dante monologue so the only name we get for them is Bone Things (great to see that cambridge degree at work!). the little bit of color we're given arrives during the book's final act, when we're refreshingly free of peter 'Gary Stu's second cousin' murdoch. finally, we get a large bazaar with monsters beyond the (frankly, boring) Shades & Bone Things, new business ventures, new plant life (kuang seems to have taken a brief page from mxtx's Ghost City drafts). otherwise, there's sand. and some cats, because they can for some reason cross metaphysical boundaries + see the dead (basically The Cat from coraline, down to the impeccable narrative timing). even king yama, the fabled, fearsome gate-keeper we've spent 500+ pages waiting for is a let-down—a giant who perches silently on his mega-awesome throne and nods along while professor grimes (at long last!) launches into his 20-minute, mustache-twirling villain diatribe. then yama snaps his fingers and we get the insta happy ending absolutely no one fought or risked anything substantial for (except, i guess, peter, who only becomes interesting posthumously). i'll be the first to say it. i wish he stayed dead. would've been a more compelling novel!now: if kuang was going to throw us into an unending, reddit-level logic puzzle, she should've gone all in. i wish Hell-with-a-capital-H was made up of physical & mental logic puzzles that peter/alice were forced to trek through, so they had a chance to put those so-called 'world-class' degrees to the test. i wish there were mazes, games, kooky game masters, survivalist schemes with direct consequence/reward systems to force proximity + build out the threadbare ship we're meant to root for (except, y'know, alice/peter hate each other for most of katabasis, and their 'chemistry' isn't established in anything but time-lapse-style flashback summaries sans dialogue shoehorned into the 2nd half of the book...do these two ever share interactions that don't involve exchanging theory? the answer is NO!). i wish ANY part of Hell delivered real stakes. there were none. we open the novel already having accepted that peter/alice gave up half of their lifespans to make the journey (and, to the surprise of no one, this consequence is quickly resolved by king yama's scowly finger-snapping...at this point, i wish he would've just broken into song, that's how Movie Magic® the finale rollout was. commit! make it a wicked marathon while we're at it!)professor grimes comprises most of the emotional/physical stakes in katabasis: peter/alice's advisor, the guy who holds the key to the ivory tower, the guy who, from minute 1 until the last pages of the novel, is an unbearable, uncharismatic, black-&-white TWAT. you had one job, kuang. make us care about the book's DRIVING FORCE. FLESH HIM OUT, GIVE HIM NUANCE, PERSONALITY. we don't get that though. as soon as i met this bitch, i knew there was some level of sexual abuse waiting right around the corner. sure, the execution was worse than i could've imagined, but my point stands. kuang practically beamed 'SEX PEST' to us from across the pond. it's like grimes ripped off his mask to reveal an identically ugly face right beneath the first. he was a parody of a scooby doo baddie. but let's back up. from the book's first paragraph, we're launched into an internal monologue. we have no idea where we are in time & space (beyond cambridge, michaelmas term, fall). i mean, literally speaking, what building and room are we in? what's around us? desks, bookcases, chalkboards? i know alice is gripping chalk, but where is she standing? in...the void? we have time for a roman propaganda interlude, a bit of dante, but no physical description, no scene-setting, no gesture work. yes, it's safe to assume we're in a classroom. but if this is the OPENING SCENE of your literal tome and your fmc is DRAWING A PENTAGRAM ON THE GROUND as an inciting event, i don't think an establishing shot is too much to ask for. i can't believe the golden girl of HarperCollins wasn't given an editor competent enough to catch this glaring visual oversight.the first bit of setting description we EVER get arrives well into chapter 1: She knew before she turned around whom she would find at the door. GIRL WHAT DOOR?!?@?# WHERE THE HELL ARE WE???(addendum: kuang finally establishes that we're in a lab 16 pgs into my ebook, after plenty more monologuing!)i hate to break it to kuang, but if you don't balance your soliloquies with basic scene work, you are in fact selling readers your term papers.perhaps my most flagrant issue with the premise of katabasis: the circumstances surrounding grimes' death. he is, in kuang's words, "the most brazen thinker of his time" & "the most influential analytic magician in England," an uncontested authority, THE foremost cambridge professor, highly sought after, lauded by magicians everywhere, well-known for making his advisees carry out the inconvenient parts of his research, with the power to open ANY door + assure tenure through a mere rec letter. and NO ONE suspects foul play when he dies suddenly and for no reason in a gruesome accident? even though "[Grimes] had yelled at [Alice] once or twice and she had yelled back and the rest of the department had probably noticed"? you've got to be fucking with me. like. girl.not only does it make no sense that alice would walk away scot-free (that no one saw her leave covered in blood while staving off a panic attack), but the ALTERNATIVE WOULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING? if alice was dedicating every last waking moment of her life to making it to Hell BECAUSE magical detectives were poking around campus, interviewing students, and getting closer to exposing her part in the murder...this would've made the journey more urgent & high-stakes! it would've given alice multiple motives (some VERY conflicting, all of them more interesting than 'needs a rec letter' or 'still kinda fantasizes about being sexually harassed by her dead advisor' or 'simultaneously wants to torture him forever?'). it would've imposed REAL temporal restrictions on the otherwise lax, free-wheeling, week-long sojourn in Hell (yes, the book takes place over 1 single week). as is, alice/peter aren't working against any kind of clock except hypothetically, grimes could be reincarnated by now, but we don't know for sure, we're just guessing hehe! again: no stakes. obfuscating alice's true part in grimes' death did NOTHING for the book's pacing or suspense.i'm running out of room, so some quick bullet points:• idk why kuang hid peter/alice's true feelings for each other in present-time when they were CANONICALLY IN LOVE all along. wdym alice doesn't know why there's a weird stir in her gut when he's around? the logic isn't logicking!• i wish we would've moved between past + present peter/alice from the outset to establish friction between their early intimacy & their current awkwardness. this way, we would've gotten some (much-needed) fluctuation and a reference point for chemistry (a chemistry the book would then work to re-establish!).• WHO WERE ALICE'S PARENTS? what's her backstory? to our knowledge, she had THE MOST NORMAL UPBRINGING, YET SHE'S NOW A WALKING, TALKING, TANTRUM-PRONE, SELF-SERVING YET SELF-FLAGELLATING(?), WOE-IS-ME, I'M-THE-WORST, I-DESERVE-TO-DIE, SEXUALLY REPRESSED LOSER FIENDING FOR A CRUMB OF GRIMES' ATTENTION? what the HELL happened in the interim? & why does she not care more about losing contact with anyone but Male Crush #1 (peter) & Male Crush #2 (grimes)? oh, wait: "...her mind wandered vaguely to her parents in Colorado[...]but she could not imagine anyone would miss her that much." okay, that resolves that i guess!• i just think it's funny that every square inch of Hell is populated with ppl from cambridge—is in fact modeled after the campus. the rest of the world? anyone outside of the (british) collegiate social class? we don't know them nor do we give a fuck about them.• kuang couldn't make up her mind about the regional or temporal inflections of her world. sometimes "Anyhow" is our only transition phrase + we get modern anachronisms ("You couldn't just [...] nope back out into Limbo."), and other times, alice/peter are unable to have convos that don't sound like this:alice, an american: Say, Peet-uh! ["Peter" but British™]peter, a brit: why, yes?alice: would you fancy a pinch of wah-tuh? ["water" but British™]so alice is a koreaboo but for english culture (cobblestones & tea & halal carts)!• i also think it's funny that she's spiritually Victorian, a quality peter later interprets as "bird-like": "She liked the light, absent feeling she got when her stomach was completely empty and she was running only on air. When she felt a pale and ethereal shade, a mind that existed without a body." okay, edward cullen with an eating disorder, let's get you some fluids and maybe then you'll calm down and stop equating paleness to perfection• the other incredibly (& unintentionally) comical part of katabasis is how terrible kuang is at eroticism. when we make it to the court of Desire, we get some remarkable world-building: "She felt she was being tested, monitored to see if any of these enticements aroused similar interests in herself. Do you like feet? Do you like dolls? Do you like hard wooden objects? [...] They saw Shades fellating dogs, licking chalkboards, writhing upon beds of panties..." (me when i'm in a competition with an asexual species of plankton to see who's better at misinterpreting what sex is)• later: "...Marilyn Monroe's splayed fingers, Jessica Rabbit, breasts bouncing. Jezebel dressed to the nines[...]Fucking bunnies, fucking like bunnies, a jackhammer, a sledgehammer, iron into flesh..." do NOT let kuang anywhere near ao3. she'll have a stroke.• it gets worse when we dive into the 'SEX PEST ADVISOR' subplot, but there's no time to unpack that here so all i'll say is: god-awful + riddled with clichés!• incredible that peter's singular flaw was revealed to be chronic illness all along (& therefore not a flaw...back to Gary Stu we go!).• some of the world-class description we get: "...dipped the chalk in her not-blood..." & "...barge-type thing composed of scrap and bones..."• "Alice didn't know whether to laugh or scream." okay, xie lian. • "'I hate that man,' she said. 'When [Grimes] died, I felt like I could breathe.'" everything in this book says otherwise (literally everything, including your own thoughts!). nice try tho.• because this takes place over 1 week, because grimes = the only stakes, & because kuang kept him from us until the very end of the book, alice's character development is fully contingent on his 'villain reveal' and is delivered in a last-minute, slipshod lightbulb moment. incredible!• i love the magical deus ex machina flower that a side character who has every reason to hate alice discovers by chance, then selflessly (& conveniently) gifts her as the key out of hell.• alice's character is like...alice's inner monologue: this is all my fault I SHOULD JUST GO DIE i can't do anything right I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUFFERING OF EVERYONE AROUND MEalice out loud: i was just trying my best ☹️😣😖😓🥺🥺🥺🥺boring, badly plotted, with an unbearably obnoxious, man-obsessed fmc & her government-assigned emotional support cardboard cutout, 0 stakes, an ensemble cast who hands her instruction manuals at every turn—in essence a colossal waste of time + my cue to never pick up another kuang book! she'll continue to be widely read & will therefore never have to engage in serious editorial overhaul. i'll leave you with 2 quotes that flawlessly capture the spirit of katabasis: "Murdoch." [Alice] followed behind him, pathetic—but she didn't know where else to go. "Please don't hate me." & What had she done since they'd come to Hell? Lied, betrayed Peter, betrayed Elspeth, landed them all in this sorry mess.

7138568645	4.5 ⭐️ I was fortunate enough to get an ARC of this book and it was incredible. There were so many complex concepts seamlessly blended together to make this masterpiece. There was magical realism, an epic adventure through hell, a critical analysis on academia and a study on our mortality just to name a few of the topics Kuang tackles in this book. It was truly such a unique story with surprising takeaways and I can’t recommend it enough.

7887174195	RATING BREAKDOWNCharacters: 3⭐️Setting: 4⭐️Plot: 3.5⭐️Themes: 4⭐️Emotional Impact: 2⭐️Personal Enjoyment: 3⭐️Total Rounded Average: 3.25⭐️My favorite aspect of this book was the symbolism. Having never read Dante's Inferno or any of the other source materials referenced in the book, I'm sure it's much richer than I was even able to notice or interpret while reading. That said, the things that stuck out to me, the lay reader, are first, that Hell is laid out as a college campus. It's so on the nose, but I adored it. And I loved that the main characters' names were Alice and Peter. I immediately thought of Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. And since we are in a Neverland/Wonderland of sorts, if it wasn't intentional, it was still brilliant. One thing about R.F. Kuang, the woman is BEYOND clever, well-read, obscure, and witty. If you want something smart to ponder and take time with, you'll find it in her books. I'm not always looking for this, but I can certainly appreciate it.Structurally, the book being a quest through the levels of Hell worked well. It made for slower pacing, but it was consistent, and it always felt like we were making progress, either into the characters' traumas and back stories, or towards their goals. The writing style felt a little like the interior of Alice's mind, at times frenzied and over-detailed, but laser-focused on the objective. It worked for me. Possibly, the academic detail will be a deterrent for some readers, but it made sense to me stylistically. I know nothing of calculus, and I could still hang with the story. Compared with Babel, this felt softer, more whimsical, and ultimately sweet. The tone of the book feels more like a healing journey, a quest of the soul, than I was anticipating. And that has left me with warm feelings for the book's messages in general.As for my own taste, some things just don't resonate with me, which is why this isn't a five-star, and it will be tough for me to recommend over other things. A few of these personal preferences have to do with the characters feeling similar to others I've read. Their struggles and behaviors felt obvious, and I lost interest. The setting is brilliant, but also awful. So mission accomplished, since it's Hell. But it didn't make me eager to pick up the book. It took a long time for me to feel invested in the characters or plot, so my emotional experience with the book was just mid. Curiosity and symbolism kept me hooked enough, and ultimately, the payoff was worth it.As for themes, I love the overall message of this story. It's optimistic and simple. The characters grow and change, and ultimately, if this is how Kuang delivers an aspirational story, instead of a cautionary social criticism, I'm here for it! If I could ask for anything, I'd just wish for more subtlety. But this is a recurring mismatch for me with this author.Technically, this is solid. Characters, setting, and plot are all clinically successful. Thematically, it has substance. For me, it's missing an emotional grip, to make me look further, linger, rage, wonder. At the end, it feels complete, but I'm not satiated. Should you read it? Well, Kuang fans will enjoy this. Readers who are hit-and-miss with Kuang's work may like this, as it has a different feel to her other work. Those who find the author's previous writing to be dry, overly academic, or obvious should probably skip this one.
7253006273	Katabasis is Info Dump: The Novel. It's a novel that seems to mistake information for narrative, so caught up in its ideas and "clever" logic that it loses sight of basically everything else. How could a novel this long have been so allergic to storytelling? I swear, it felt like all the information in this book was delivered through massive chunks of exposition. Explaining how Hell works? Massive chunk of exposition. Exploring the characters' lives and experiences? Massive chunk of exposition. Critical moment where the characters finally talk to each other? Massive chunk of exposition. And it's not even that it's a lazy novel, but rather that its energy is entirely misdirected: rather than spend time fleshing out its characters' dynamics or storylines (which, let me tell you, are frustratingly threadbare and massively underwhelming), it funnels almost all its energy into explaining scholarly theories and paradoxes and logic and math etc etc etc. And the fact of the matter is, I can't invest in ~Ideas~ and ~Theory~ when they're not grounded in solid storytelling with solid character dynamics. The result being that Katabasis read like a textbook with the thin veneer of a novel imposed onto it. This whole novel just felt like an inside joke I didn't get--and by the end, I really had no desire to "get" it, anyway.(thank you to hrc for the eARC!)
7316090907	Potential Spoilers Ahead!!!Beneath the ancient stone walls of Cambridge University, Alice Law is pursuing a master’s degree in Analytical Magic. She’s smart and hardworking, but no matter how much effort she puts in, she just can’t seem to win the favor of her advisor, Professor Grimes - a powerful academic gatekeeper who basically controls the entire field. His biases and manipulations are like invisible spells, shaping the fate of his students. Those who don’t earn his approval, no matter how brilliant, often find themselves sidelined and forgotten.Then, during a magical experiment gone wrong, Grimes dies - and his soul ends up in hell. Alice originally just wanted to advance her academic career, but after his death, she makes a shocking decision: she offers up half of her remaining lifespan in exchange for a one - time trip to the underworld, hoping to bring Grimes back. Joining her is Peter Murdoch, another of Grimes’s students. He’s nothing like Alice - different personality, different beliefs - but in this journey, they become each other’s only lifeline.Their descent into the underworld - called Katabasis - takes them from one infernal hall to another, facing philosophical riddles, logical paradoxes, and trials of the soul. Along the way, they meet the Shades - spirits who were once victims of Grimes’s cruelty and deception. These souls are waiting for rebirth, and for justice. The more Alice sees, the more she starts to question her mission: why save someone who’s hurt so many?As the journey deepens, Alice’s goal quietly shifts. She no longer wants to rescue Grimes - she wants to bring Peter back with her. She realizes that the man she once idolized, the person she aspired to become, isn’t worth sacrificing her life for. Grimes belongs in hell. What she truly needs is to reclaim the part of herself she gave up chasing a false ideal.So this is a novel packed with intellectual weight. Reading it feels like you need a cheat code - math, logic, Greek mythology, philosophy… all these layers are woven into the story’s fabric. The title itself comes from Greek, meaning ”a journey into the underworld,” often referring to a hero or deity who ventures into the realm of the dead and returns with a loved one or deeper wisdom. So yeah, the title kind of spoils the plot - but in a poetic way.The book reminded me of the Kuang’s other works. In Yellowface, she takes aim at the publishing industry’s hypocrisy and gatekeeping. In Babel she goes full force against the colonial undertones of Oxford. And here in Katabasis, she turns her critique toward academia itself - specifically the toxic power dynamics between professors and students. Cambridge’s ivory tower isn’t sacred anymore; it’s a breeding ground for control and oppression.Kuang’s writing is wildly creative and ambitious. She blends Eastern and Western mythologies seamlessly: there’s Hell, but also Lord Yama; the River Lethe from Greek myth, and Meng Po from Chinese lore; Dante’s inferno meets traps set by the betrayed Weaver Girl. There’s Orpheus descending into the underworld for love, and now, students diving into hell for their professor. This cultural mashup is totally my thing - it’s rich, layered, and challenges how we perceive myth and meaning.So why does Alice insist on saving Grimes? By the end, I realized she wasn’t trying to save a person - she was chasing an ideal, a version of the future she thought she wanted. She was willing to give up everything for that imagined future, which is something a lot of us do. We sacrifice the present for a dream that might not even be real.When Alice finally sees Grimes for who he truly is - a morally bankrupt, mediocre academic who bullied and harassed students - she also sees through her own illusions. Her rescue mission becomes a personal reckoning. She’s no longer trying to save him; she’s trying to save herself. This journey through hell was never about him - it was always about her.Of course, with 2 young protagonists, romance is bound to show up. I get that. But Alice’s emotional shift felt a bit jarring - she goes from being laser - focused on academia to suddenly prioritizing being with Peter. It didn’t quite sit right with me. They’re brave enough to face death, yet too scared to admit their feelings? That trope felt a little tired, and didn’t fully match Alice’s character.That said, Kuang mentioned in an interview that this book was written for her husband - a brilliant, gentle man who even added her surname, Kuang, to his own. Knowing that, the romance feels more personal, more heartfelt. It’s a love letter between intellectuals, wrapped in myth and metaphor.As expected, Katabasis isn’t an easy read. It doesn’t cater to the casual reader or chase market trends. It demands knowledge, cultural awareness, and philosophical patience. But that’s exactly what makes it special. In a time when love is dismissed, literature is commodified, and knowledge is oversimplified, this book stands as a quiet rebellion.It’s not a book that’s easy to understand as well, but it’s one that deserves to be understood. It’s a literary descent, a spiritual journey, a conversation between self and world. And as I read it, I felt like I was going through my own Katabasis too.4.6 / 5 stars

7119977643	3.5 stars A trip to hell to rescue a soul should not be this boring. This book left me with a mix of conflicting feelings. I know R.F. Kuang is brilliant—her passion for her subject matter just radiates from every page, and she's undeniably an intellectual. The way she addresses women's experiences in academia through the main character Alice is razor-sharp, and I genuinely appreciated how unflinching the book is about tackling hypocrisy, misogyny (including the internalised kind), problematic feminism, classism, and all those badly behaving men who populate academic spaces. Like, she doesn't pull punches on any of that, and I respect it.The worldbuilding- I found it very fascinating. I loved how the book imagines this alternate history where every recorded story or account of hell and journeys into it are treated as genuine explorer reports of a real place. In this world, all the different depictions of hell throughout history, each written from a different time, culture, and perspective, are fragments of a collective attempt to describe something that actually exists. That idea alone is incredibly compelling. It reframes literature, religion, and folklore as part of this long, shared process of discovery, like scholars or travellers trying to document an unfamiliar realm that no one can fully comprehend.I especially admired how R.F. Kuang weaves all these accounts—many of which exist both in her world and ours as "fictional" works into a single, unified version of hell. She takes the common threads and recurring images from across these sources and fuses them into her own vision of what hell could look like and how its nine circles might actually function if they were real.Especially at the start, the imagery and the depiction of the world feels newly alive, like we're reading the culmination of every prior attempt to describe hell. The pieces of mythology and lore that appear throughout the book deepen that sense of reality through a lot of academic flavour.And here's where I think the true genius lies, where hell becomes this twisted reflection of academia itself. Pride manifests as a library, Desire as a student centre, and scholars are condemned to write dissertations on their sins forever. The eternal torture of peer review and endless citations and grind of academic validation that is both ironic and devastatingly fitting. The implication that hell is the destination for people like Peter and Alice, who's obsession over the pursuit of knowledge and validation mirrors their damnation.Yet hell in this book isn't only an academic construct or a literary exercise—it's also a philosophical one. The more you think about how it works, the more questions it raises about personalisation and multiplicity. Like if hell is meant to mirror each individual's flaws or sins, then why do people end up sharing the same version of it? Is it tied to a person's moral failures, etc.? It makes this version of hell feel unsettling yet thought-provoking, and leads to even bigger questions about how many versions of hell might exist. The book doesn't answer these questions outright, but they hang in the background, shaping how we interpret the story. Even though they're not central to the plot, these philosophical undercurrents give the world a richness and ambiguity that invite reflection when we finish the book.Understanding Alice's character is essential to this book. She's introduced as a linguist and classicist with a photographic memory, someone whose intellect is inseparable from her trauma. Her character arc is meant to be the novel's heart—this reckoning with abuse, self-delusion, and guilt unfolding against the 80s academia setting. Alice is written as a compelling character. Her internalised misogyny and belief in meritocracy blind her to the systemic cruelty around her. She is isolated, self-deceiving, and desperate for approval; hence, she becomes easy prey for Dr Grimes, her brilliant yet monstrous mentor. She idolises him because she needs him to justify her suffering. We watch her obsession turn into despair and self-destruction, like even her attempt to resurrect him speaks to her broken need for control and vengeance. She simultaneously hates and defends him because admitting he wasn't worth it means admitting that everything she sacrificed was for nothing.So ultimately this book is good in the sense that the premise, the themes, the messages, the ambitious drive—it's all good. But the narrative structure, pacing, and storytelling, in turn, made the book an extremely tiresome and boring read.After that strong opening, there's no sense of urgency. Not once was I invested in Alice and Peter's journey through hell. They're never cautious; there's no momentum in the plot. They are in hell—yet it doesn't feel dangerous or suspenseful. We have countless myths, legends, and works about hell featuring trials, danger, and vicious deities, and Alice and Peter are simply strolling through it.The Kripkes as villains had brilliant potential, but their motivations are so cartoonish and their threat so defanged that I was never worried for the main characters. Babel had more nuanced character development than this. Yes, Alice and Peter face consequences, but then we just move on. Everything feels resolved too easily, leaving me with more questions—what happened after they did that? Why did it work? There's no sustained anxiety about what hell might throw at them next, no sense that the stakes are mounting. The obstacles appear and dissolve with equal ease, draining any tension from the narrative. The entire journey feels like "and then this happens, and then this happens, and then something occurs, but what did it mean? Moving on, and then this happens."Peter is an especially weak character—not because he lacks potential, but because his characterisation is handled so poorly. We don't know much about him for most of the book, and when we finally get some insight into why he acts the way he does, something massive happens that recontextualises everything. The revelation itself was so jarring because we'd been given so little foundation to understand him before that point. It's as though his character suddenly comes into focus only to immediately transform into something else entirely. As for the romance, I wasn't invested at all. There's no chemistry between the two characters. Maybe that's intentional since this book isn't really a romance, but there's absolutely no emotional honesty. They barely ever talk about their feelings, and I need depth, vulnerability, or at least something to make it convincing. Perhaps the lack of emotional honesty is meant to undermine or comment on Alice's arc of self-deception, but if so, it doesn't land—all it just feels unconvincing, and what happens to Peter later makes the relationship even less satisfying in retrospect.My main issue, and I know this is a very common critique by many others I know that, and I understand why she is that type of writer because her messages are not subtle—I just want to say in my opinion it's exhausting. Kuang doesn't trust her readers. In Babel, there's a tendency toward heavy-handed thematic clarity—yes, it was literally paint-by-numbers colonialism, but at least the footnotes gave you a choice. You could skip them if you already understood the context. The educational material didn't interrupt the narrative itself; it was adjacent to it. That structural decision, while still didactic, at least kept the story moving. Here, that restraint is gone entirely. The copious textual references and explanations are embedded directly into the prose, breaking the narrative flow. Don't get me wrong: I do need things explained. I learned so much through this book, and I appreciated the education. But the difference is that Babel's heavy-handedness didn't stop the plot dead in its tracks every few pages. This book does. Yes, the characters understand all these theorems and logic paradoxes, but how much depth did we really need in the moment? The constant interruption for explanation slowed the plot to a crawl. It also kills some of the mystery. Hell should feel unknowable, frightening in its inscrutability, but instead it's exhaustively annotated. I wouldn't mind googling references or doing a bit of work to understand allusions on my own time, but being force-fed explanations mid-text pulls you out of the story entirely.Despite my extensive criticisms, this isn't a failed book. It's an ambitious, intelligent work and an important testament on knowledge, guilt, and what it takes to reclaim one's humanity from the ashes of obsession. The satirical conceit works: the whole plot and character setup is deliberately over-the-top, a grand metaphor using a fantastical journey to hell to represent the oppressive, soul-crushing aspects of academic ambition.The problem is that intellectual success doesn't translate to experiential satisfaction. The ideas work; the reading experience doesn't. From an author like R.F. Kuang, I expect greatness, not just competence. This wasn't great—it was competent in concept but tedious in execution, which is perhaps the most fitting critique one can give a book about hell. This is my least favourite work of hers that I've read. It's still very much a great book, but I was just expecting better from her.
7149193728	⭐ 4,50 starskatabasis wasn’t what i expected and that turned out to be a good thing. i went in thinking it would have action,fast-paced fantasy, something in the vein of the poppy war. instead, i found deeper,academic,more introspective story. it doesn’t unravel through plot, but through people.their grief, their guilt, their detachment from being alive.reminded me of babel in the storytelling,and the academic style at some parts. the pacing is slow,but it mirrors the characters emotional paralysis. you’re not reading to find out what happens next,you’re reading to understand why these people are the way they are.“she was so tired of the contents of her mind. her thoughts were so loud; they pounded her skull, it never stopped, it was all too much.”peter and alice broke me.but i wish we had seen more of them. their relationship was full of history and tension.but the book only offered glimpses: shared glances, quiet breathing, unspoken memories. maybe that’s intentional. maybe some connections aren’t meant to be revived,just remembered.grimes’s storyline caught me off guard. it was raw and deeply unsettling, but also one of the book’s strongest emotional threads. it forces you to sit with the discomfort. there are no clean resolutions.just a quiet honesty.“all the ghost stories were wrong; hauntings were so rarely malicious. the dead only wanted to feel included.”katabasis doesn’t shout but its presence stays with you.the concept was so good but had a few missed emotional moments.if i hadn’t read her previous books i would rated it 5 stars. still, this book left a mark on me and so glad to get an arc from one of my favorite authors.thank you to harpercollins for the arc, it was a dream come true.....this will be the BEST thing of 2025.
7871393283	Where oh where to begin this review.I can usually rattle off my thoughts within minutes of finishing a book. This is the first time in a long, long time I've taken over a week to even try to gather my thoughts.To say it plainly - Katabasis is the sort of book to recalibrate something within me. A book that spoke to my very soul.I've always had such an intense love for the dark academia subculture, its themes often pulling on so many tangled, complicated emotions towards academia as both institution and romantic image in one. The indulgence of knowledge, paired with the stark contrast between an appreciation for the aesthetic vs the feverish, cult-like darkness that can often lurk behind closed doors, is a very specific feat to accomplish well - and Kuang proved she could manage it with Babel.With Katabasis, those same themes were achieved but with a shift in aim for its scathing criticism of academia, and with a stronger romance element too. After loving Babel, I hardly dared hope Katabasis would reach the same level of enjoyment. But it somehow, unbelievably, managed just that. Katabasis proved to be one of those rare books that felt personal somehow. For better or for worse, I saw parts of myself in Alice and Peter. I saw their flaws and hated them for it because I understood some of them all too closely, wanted to shake them knowing it'll get them nowhere. And I adore reading about insufferable characters if done right. Another balance Kuang manages effortlessly.Hand in hand with those characters are their backstories. While I don't wish to go into any amount of detail (admittedly, it's a large contributing factor to why I struggle to review or even talk about this book), one thing I didn't expect to find was a touch on chronic illness that was so succinct, yet so accurate to my own experience in academia, that I shut the book and stared at the wall for a long while. Not once have I heard or seen that particular experience from someone else. To use my own staircase analogy, it felt like I missed one step from the bottom - startling, yet comforted once the shock fades. While the moment in the story itself passed quickly, everything in me felt laid bare, and continued to be so throughout. It was humbling and overwhelming all at once. There's a lot of discourse around this book, grand expectations built up and readers daunted by the apparent homework it requires. Even if it'll ease one person to know - I don't think it's necessary. Of course, R.F. Kuang has a brilliant mind and there's no escaping that knowledge throughout. But just as she is a successful academic, she is a successful writer. She knows how to remind you of what's relevant, to break down the bones of her point to ensure readers understand enough to keep reading. I truly don't believe all the talk of philosophy and mythology and whatever other types of -ologies need to be all that daunting. It's Kuang's job to guide us through. She doesn't lock you in a philosophy lecture.It's a strange one, to have so many emotions tied to a book. I could prattle on for days (clearly). Equally, you could ask me my thoughts and I'd simply stop in my tracks.I know this book won't be for everyone. But it sure as hell* felt written for me.*Let's not get into how 'sure' hell is after reading this, eh?
6959250039	3.5 🪽katabasis to me was so hard to rate and is so hard to write a proper review for. like all of r.f. kuang’s work, there are so many different elements in the story interwoven together - she combines many complex themes with each other - however, they always tie together to prove the main one. i think most people’s interpretation of the message of this book is how your academic life can literally feel like hell on earth and how corrupt the education system has been, and i completely agree. i think kuang added all these characters and stages of Hell in the story to further emphasize her point. grimes, elspeth’s story, the courts of hell, peter, and dare i say even magnolia & nico.again, as i said, this review was so hard to write, so please bear with me. at first, after reading the reviews, i was confused, because Alice, our protagonist, really didn’t seem like a terrible character - in fact, i even liked her and understood where she was coming from. however, as i got further into the story (maybe the halfway point), i started to realize where people were coming from. the reason i was sympathetic towards her in the beginning was because her reasons for pursuing such academic success - the amount of success that she struggled for - was relatable. honestly, don’t mind the romance reader in me, but sometimes her mindset reminded me ann liang fmcs’ - the constant need for academic validation and consistently being on top. at the halfway point however, she said some things and made some decisions that were, questionable, at best. i will say that my support for her wavered a bit, but thankfully, by the end, she became a likable character once more. i think one aspect that really cemented her character growth to me was obviously, her thought and actions toward grimes, but more so, I think, her behavior and empathy towards Elspeth. the stark contrast her actions showed when she first met elspeth versus the end was astounding. all this to say, i think her character development was truly incredible, especially considering how much she was, i don’t want to say brainwashed, but brainwashed, manipulated, and set on her choices in the beginning.was katabasis a love story? in my opinion, i don’t think so. there was definitely a teensy romance subplot in it, but truly, the romance was so, so, so far from i think, what kuang wanted us to take from this book. yes, peter and Alice ended up together, but i think it was so miniscule in the grand scheme of things. Peter definitely helped alice realize some things and become sympathetic towards others, but i think that was more through their friendship with each other and the time they spent together rather than a romantic connection. don’t let this scare you though - i thoroughly enjoyed their romantic relationship. by the end, it’s impossible to believe that Alice and Peter are anything but perfect for each other - I mean, they literally gave each other a reason to actually live life. that said, i didn’t really connect to peter’s character - (view spoiler)[especially considering the fact that he DIED halfway through the book 😭 and didn’t come back to life until literally the very end. i feel like if we got to see more of his past life, his experience with Cambridge and the education system in general, i would’ve felt way more connected to him. on the flip side, i do think his death was necessary for Alice to be able to grow on her own without the pressure or outside thoughts from anyone. (hide spoiler)] all that to say, i didn’t hate Peter at all and quite liked it when he had screen time. the main critique that people had with this book was that it was “too academic” or that it had too much info dumping. personally, the info dumping definitely was on the heavier side, but it was necessary. r.f. kuang has always been an academic - and I think going into this book expecting anything else is just setting yourself up for failure, ESPECIALLY when babel was one of her releases prior to this book, and ESPECIALLY when this book is in the dark academia genre. the definition of dark academia is literally “dark academia is a literary aesthetic and subculture concerned with higher education, the arts, and literature, or an idealised version thereof”, and i think the book definitely doesn’t stray from it. honestly, for the most part, i was interested in the little rants or tidbits of information that she would write about Kant, Dante, or other famous philosophers, activists, academics, etc. because i really think it added some more flavor to the book and how these famous people connected to kuang’s own idea of the underworld, the meaning of life, or the education system. the pacing of this book was definitely, without a doubt, extremely slow-paced. it felt like nothing was happening for most of the book, but suddenly at the end, everything led up to that climax. Alice & Peter traversing through the courts and experiencing revolutions took my time up in the most delicious way. and i just need to mention that the last 80 pages were SPECTACULAR. another thing that I also loved was the addition of little interludes sprinkled throughout the book. they offered so much more insight to the story and enhanced it overall. the last thing that i wanted to say in terms of the order of things that happened in the book, was the plot twist at the end. if you’re expecting some incredible or mind-blowing plot twist: you’re not going to get it. i predicted the end when I was about 200 pages away from it. another major thing that kuang succeeded in conveying in this story was the idea of the underworld and what happens after death. the amount of existential crises that i experienced throughout this book was wild compared to any other book that i’ve read about paranormal activities or anything related to the afterlife. I was genuinely wondering what our purpose is on earth as humans and as individuals. (view spoiler)[random side note: why did magnolia and Theo following Nico into the Lethe actually make me sad. maybe I'm psychotic. (hide spoiler)]it’s finally time for what i think, is the thesis: the corrupt system of education throughout history and how it’s harmed so many people. first off, WOW. in my opinion, kuang really succeeded in developing this idea throughout the book. Alice, our main character, literally embodied this. (view spoiler)[she was starving herself, regretting not letting her professor SA her, giving up half her lifespan to bring back her professor (hide spoiler)], and so. much. more. it was genuinely making me sad how our world has shapen into people using the most valuable and best thing in life, knowledge, and weaponized it against others. and although this is a fantasy book, it’s something that is very much a real life thing. professor grimes made me unbelievably angry and upset in this book. how can you, a professor, do these things to your students and manipulate them like this? how can you make them feel and think like this? disgusting. and i think some students are so blinded by their efforts for success, recognition, or money, that they just fall into this trap, again & again, demonstrated by our protagonist. and of course, Alice, as a woman, faced the harsh realities of how women were treated in the 1980s and still, today. the way women are diminished just because we have a vagina is still insanity to me. i don’t know where this idea started and will forever mourn the day that this spread across the globe. because we, as women, are just as intelligent, strong, fearsome, and valuable as men. it PAINED me when i read about how Alice and her peers were treated by male professors when they were just there to get an education just like the men. (view spoiler)[the fact that Alice even blocked out her being a women… i can’t. (hide spoiler)] so yes, the education system that also includes societal standards was incredibly fucked up then, and might just be as fucked up (maybe a little better) right now. kuang, as an academic, has (presumably) definitely experienced this and it shows throughout this book. her critique of the education system was incredibly saddening but insightful at the same time and i think that katabasis, without a doubt, succeeded (with flying colors) in conveying this complex but necessary message.⊹ ﹒ ⁺ ﹒ ⊹ ﹒ ⁺ ﹒ ⊹ ﹒ ⁺ ﹒ ⊹ ﹒ ⁺ ﹒ ⊹ ﹒ ⁺ ﹒ ⊹ ﹒ ⁺ ﹒ ⊹☆ ── preread ⊹so excited to finally read one of my most anticipated releases 🧎‍♀️ counting this as a fall book because that's what it gives 🤚🏻⌗ fall book #3.

6993349685	⁀ ⊹ ₊ To be a magician was to be that tortoise racing Achilles; deluding himself, as the runner loomed larger behind him, that space and time would hang still so that he might stay ahead.mother kuang has done it again!! i'm probably throwing up a little bit from the sheer emotional whiplash this book put me through. katabasis by r.f. kuang is my most anticipated release of the year, and receiving an arc to buddy read alongside my bestie, fadhee was an absolute privilege. and lemme just say, all the pain, all the misery, all the existential dread we endured from babel? this book fixed it. mostly.── 𖣠 plot summaryalice law dreamed of being the best magician. she put all her effort, mind, and even health into it. her biggest goal was to work with jacob grimes, the world's greatest magician at cambridge. alice did everything jacob asked, even when he was mean to her, just to get his approval.but then, jacob grimes died in a magic accident that alice caused. now, his soul is in hell. alice must do whatever it takes to bring him back, even if it means going to hell herself.peter murdoch, who was always competing with alice, decides to join her on this mission to find jacob's soul. this journey is very dangerous and might cost them their own souls.will this adventure destroy them? will alice and peter become more than rivals, or will everything end in disaster?── 𖣠 characters𖣠 alice lawfull disclosure, i was so damn biased about her character at the start. she kept giving me the ick, consistently. why? because she’s the biggest teacher's pet you’ll ever meet, but make it dark academia. her ambition felt almost unhinged. she’d sell her soul for an A, and guess what? she literally almost did. but miss author, you sly dog, you got me. her character growth done so subtly, so painfully, so realistically that by the end, i was stanning her. ⁀ ⊹ ₊ She gazed at Peter and thought, 'I wish I were the night, so that I might watch your sleep with a thousand eyes.'𖣠 peter murdochmy pookie. my shayla. my absolute chaotic nerd prince. peter, oh peter. he wears slutty glasses, which is just chef's kiss character design, thank you very much. i was obsessed with him from page one. he's this glorious mix of whiny and sensitive but also fiercely intelligent and surprisingly loyal. there were so many moments where he'd be complaining about something absolutely dire in hell, and i just couldn't stop laughing. and miss author truly gave me the biggest emotional whiplash about him. i was ready to throw the book across the room at one point, i was so mad. but listen, the end was worth every single tear. peter murdoch deserves the world. ⁀ ⊹ ₊ Peter Murdoch was a book with no ending and all she wanted to do with the rest of her life was to trace her finger down every page.𖣠 elspeth bayeselspeth is and always will be the it girl. I LOVE HER SO MUCH. she was such a grounding, amazing character. her wisdom, her resilience, her absolute patience with these two chaotic grad students on their journey through literal hell was so good. a literal queen. she was the one holding it all together, the unsung hero, and i would follow her into any supernatural dimension. period no tampon.⁀ ⊹ ₊ “Go on. Be brave, love.”𖣠 professor jacob grimes:FUCK YOU. his entire existence in this book is a testament to how even in death, some people just can't stop being trash. ── 𖣠 my thoughts and overview:let's get into the drama, the tension, the 'are they gonna kiss or murder each other?' vibe that is the relationship between alice and peter. it was executed so damn well. they are the quintessential academic rivals to lovers, but make it high-stakes, life-or-death, and literally in hell. their constant competition, their barbed banter, the way they simultaneously infuriate and rely on each other was just perfection. their whole journey throughout hell was a massive rollercoaster. one minute i was giggling at their passive-aggressive arguments, the next i was tearing up at a moment of genuine vulnerability between them. the slow burn, the forced proximity, the mutual goal despite everything, it’s all there, and it's giving everything i ever wanted from an enemies-to-lovers trope.the plot itself was done so well. fadhee and i were constantly on edge, genuinely scared about what fresh hell (pun intended) was going to happen next. BUT. and there's always a but lol. there was so much information dumping in this book, especially in the middle section, that i did find myself sort of bored at times. my eyes glazed over during some of the more detailed magical theory or historical lore dumps. it didn't detract too much from the overall experience because the characters and stakes always pulled me back in, but it definitely broke the flow a few times. also, if you’re expecting HUGE, earth-shattering plot twists that leave your jaw on the floor, you might be a little disappointed. i actually guessed the ending right before it happened. however, even though i saw it coming, the execution was still so good that it didn't diminish the impact. certain parts truly made me want to rip my hair out in frustration, or scream laugh at the sheer absurdity, but the journey and the ending were worth every single bit of it.if you’re a fan of dark academia with a heavy dose of fantasy, a dash of mythological elements, and a chef's kiss academic rivals-to-lovers romance as a subplot, this book is for you. it's gritty, it’s smart, it's emotionally resonant, and it will have you questioning your own life choices (and your professors). miss author has once again proven why she's one of the most exciting voices in modern fantasy fiction.lastly, a very big thank you to my bestie fadhee for reading this with me. i couldn't have done this without you. love you!! tropes:─ dark academia ─ academic rivals to lovers ─ a journey to hell─ betrayals ─ use of chalk and magick ─ mentions of ancient concepts─ mentions of different mythologies thank you netgalley and harper voyager for the e-arc! all thoughts are my own!
7361294901	i’m freeeee! rtc, maybeOkay I have gathered my thoughts (I even have proper capitalization and punctuation) I think this may be rfk weakest book…. I’m just in shock that this is her 6th book. Katabasis did not feel like rfk’s writing at all, it read more like a young adult debut novel. The structure was off; we had 5 paragraphs dedicated to describing a river, lots of repetitiveness throughout the book, weird sentence structures and very unserious and corny dialogue. The writing was very juvenile. As usual rfk leans onto info dumping and not trusting the audience to come to their own conclusions. But this was on a whole other level. It was all academia drivel that took you out entirely from the story, all to show how intellectually superior she is. We get it we all know you went to an Ivy League school and prestigious universities in Europe. All the academic talk aside the story itself was very boring. For it being an intriguing premise, it was done so poorly and felt like it was written in one sitting (she worked on this for 2 years?) I also can’t help and feel like this was another self insert story. Which isn’t a bad thing, but whenever she writes about marginalization, racism, or sexism it all comes from a place of privilege and is very surface level. As for the characters, they were very one dimensional and again boring. There was absolutely no depth to this novel. The reason I said this is her weakest book was because it’s forgettable and boring. Not even bad enough to hate read, no substance to cling on to. This is not the same book people were making recommended reading list to prepare for Katabasis.
6890093709	3 starsThis was a good book; very well-written, well-researched, with an interesting premise. You can tell that a lot of hard work went into this book. However, I was never gripped by it and just found myself indifferent throughout most of the book. This was largely due to two things:1. Alice was insufferable. I found her so so unlikable. I don't know if this was done on purpose or not, but for almost 80% of the book, I was praying for her downfall😅😅 Again, maybe Kuang meant for her to be so unlikable? Maybe I'm the problem? I just did not relate to this girl at all. Going to hell to rescue your professor whom you hate because he could open doors for you as far as being a Magician just did not sit right with me for a motive. (there is also another reason but it's a spoiler and even that reason was not enough to convince me) I think this is a me problem though.. maybe other readers will find that motive to be sufficient and I think that would make the reading experience much better!2. THE MATH. Listen, I knew going into this that it would be educationally heavy and I actually don't mind learning while reading any genre of book; in fact, I prefer it. However, in this book, it felt like the author was trying to smack me upside the head with all the info she knows, from philosophy to theoretical math and physics and everything in between. I don't mind a book challenging me, but I do mind a book boring me😅 It's not like I didn't understand what she was saying; she actually explained them pretty well, but will I retain this HUGE amount of information? Signs point to no😅 I just think this book was too heavy handed with all the theoretical jargon. AGAIN, totally a me problem, and this might be some other readers' cup of tea. The beauty of opinions.My favorite Parts:1. Achilles the cat was the real mvp of this book.2. I liked Peter and he deserves better than Alice.✋3. The themes touched upon in the novel were interesting (feminism, women in the work field, sexism, ambition, abuse of power, stress on students, existentialism...) However, they were nothing new or revolutionary? Like nothing new was added to the discussion of these topics..at least for me.Just to reiterate, this is a very good book, just not a good or memorable book FOR ME. This maybe due to the fact that books about academia never really grip me. As a teacher, I am up to my ears in academia, so reading about it as well might be subconsciously icking me😅Also, my buddy reader Ashlyn actually dnfed this one😭 hope we have a better buddy read next 💖
8085173941	this is one of those books that i am eternally grateful to have read, the story will live in my bone marrow …. but the actual experience of reading it, mostly in terms of actualllly wanting to pick it up just. wasn’t. always. there.
7073457335	Spoiler Free 5-min Review Video:https://youtu.be/9FuR90gz5n4Personally I think this is Kuangs best book yet. I loved it. Katabasis is about two graduate students who journey into hell to try and save their advisors soul. It draws on Dante's Inferno and lots of philosophy, but I think it's a pretty accessible (albeit slower paced) book. This book has LAYERS but it gets at things like different ideas of the afterlife, the treatment of women and minorities in academia, academic and workplace abuse among others. It's smart and nuanced, and Alice is a great main character. I really feel like Kuangs character work has developed with this book and she nails the landing with how this ends. It is indeed a journey, both literally through the different parts of hell, and figuratively as our main character reflects on her life and grows. It's set in an alternate version of our world where magick exists and is an academic subject. I can't say too much about it without spoilers, but I absolutely recommend it! It's not a quick read - it's the kind of book that requires close attention and space to think. I read it over a couple of months and I'm glad I didn't rush it. That said, I DON'T think you need to have a background in philosophy or have read Dante's Inferno to enjoy and understand this. If you have read those things, you will probably get an added layer of depth, but it seems designed to be relatively accessible as long as you have some patience. Personally though, it's one of my favorite things I've read this year. I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher, all opinions are my own.
7139998461	A HUGE THANK YOU to NetGalley and Harper Voyager for the ARC!I love Kuang's style!I liked that we set off on our journey right away, even if it felt a bit abrupt.I was immediately drawn into the atmosphere, and I started building some theories (I don't know why; I didn't get anywhere with them. I really need to stop trying to predict the endings of books)This book reminded me of a mix of Babel and Ninth House, as well as Alice in Wonderland! Philosophy, mathematics, wildness and darkness, life and death.“If he/she won't go to hell with you, why do you need him/her?”Honestly, there were moments when I was bored and wanted more action (?). But at the same time, the book made me think.What is life, and are we really living it, or are we just missing out on what’s important while chasing after what’s not?What disappointed me was the FMC; perhaps it was because I didn’t understand her, I didn’t share her feelings, and I didn't like her actions in the past.The whole book is from the FMC’s perspective, and there’s also a dual timeline; only one chapter is dedicated to the MMC, whom I liked, he's like a cinnamon roll, and I teared up at his story.At times, I laughed at the beginning, and at other times, I found myself tearing up.The rivals to lovers trope, oh, thank you! I liked that they were rivals for quite a while, with a bit of hatred, but despite that, they were also friends. The descriptions of the moments from the past when they spent time together made my heart clench!After the ending, I don’t know what to write or how to describe my feelings. It wasn’t a disappointment, but it wasn’t what I expected either. Still, I found myself teary over the book Rebecca again, though for a more personal reason this time.What is the purpose of this journey, to rescue the professor, or something else?Idea: 5/5 Plot: 4/5 Emotions: 4/5 Characters: 3/5 (Peter 4.5/5)• Hell • Dark academia • Rivals to lovers • Toxic professor ‼️Warnings: Child death, Gore, Sexual assault, Suicidal thoughts, Suicide, Blood, Violence, Chronic illness, Sexism, Injury/Injury detail, Panic attacks
7877906504	Anyways, I liked this. The premise ("Two grad students travel to Hell to get a letter of rec from their dead advisor") is catchy, but Katabasis works best as a character study of Alice Law. Kuang's exploration of a woman dedicated to academia even when it rejects her reads as compelling and frustrating. Relatability is not something I usually seek out in books, but this was just such a book tailored for ME and what I like about dark academia. I've never seen my own attitudes towards grad school mirrored so honestly; I kept returning to Alice's realization that she pursued a PhD not because of any unique curiousity for her field, but because learning is something she liked and was good at it, and wanted commendation for. It's also nice to read an author who continues to dedicate herself to complex & potentially alienating characters. I think where Katabasis stumbles is the imbalance between promise of premise and execution. The beginning of the book centers Alice and Peter discussing how they will travel through Hell, how they will search for their advisor Jacob Grimes, and what challenges the respective circles of Hell will present. But the journey Alice takes is internal. She may be physically crossing from Wrath to Cruelty, but Katabasis isn't interested in overcoming that boundary except for what it means for Kuang to play around with landscapes and set dressing. This isn't a book about two people navigating Hell, it's about what it means for their relationship to academia once they get there. Thematically this is fine, and more interesting than the alternative, but at the end I'm left wondering why we spent so much of the first half of this book pretending otherwise. Why have Alice and Peter wander for so long through Pride? Why place so much weight on the difference between Greed and Wrath to have your characters speed by them?This is a book for people who are In On The Joke and who enjoy tangents about magic systems and debate clubs. I read entire sections out loud to my fiance, and I kept waiting for a Second Reviewer bit to hit. Katabasis is a book that's been recommended too widely-not because it's too "academic"/"smart" or that only a certain kind of person will understand it (we must be honest with ourselves, this is a very easy book to follow), but because it's so fine-tuned to an audience who /will/ care about the difference between magic chalk brands and linguistics jokes and Camus memes, or whatever. That doesn't necessarily affect whether the story is good or bad. Just if you are annoying enough to like it. Which I am. Thank you to the publisher for an advance copy. Opinions are my own.
7866943532	4⭐️What a journey this was. What an absolute ride! This was my first R. F. Kuang books and its just set it did NOT disappoint.There was just so much to love about this book, the first being the characters. The way R. F. Kuang wrote these characters was nothing short of brilliant. I mean COME. ON!! Alice and Peter were 2 of the most unique, depth-centric characters I have ever read. Not only was the story magical and captivating, but the characters stood on a pedestal. Alice was intellectual and brave and so driven that it inevitably became one of her biggest flaws. When light had shed on Peter’s past and the struggle that BOTH of these characters had to endure, it made you think: these characters were perfect at being imperfect.I would like to point out that this book was absolutely incredible for like 80% of the book, but the ending definitely left something to be desired. I wasn’t as drawn in and it dragged quite a bit nearing the 450-500 page mark. I was worried that I would rate this lower but I just couldn’t; I had a phenomenal time reading this. However, I think the little “side quest” Alice went on with the Kirpkes (iykyk) was pretty rushed and I felt like it didn’t add a whole lot to the story.The journey during the entire rest of the book, however, was amazing. I could not put this book down no matter how hard I tried. While Kuang’s words are complex and the language she uses in her writing can be confusing at times, it was easy for me to sink my teeth into it and it wasn’t confusing enough for me to lose interest. This was very much written in a way that you need to use a lot of brain power and it can take some getting used to. I HIGHLY encourage you to read it nonetheless. The story, the character, the journey; everything made this book the well-written, captivating it piece of art that it is.I know Kuang is very intimidating to a lot of people, me included, but starting with this one just felt right. It was complex yet not uninteresting. It was entertaining yet not too confusing. This book felt like it had the writing and tones of a modern classic. At least that’s what I kept feeling and thinking as I was reading this book.Let this be your sign to pick up a book of hers. I’m really looking forward to reading Babel given how much of a hit this was for me!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~𝓟𝓻𝓮-𝓡𝓮𝓪𝓭: 🤎🍂My first R. F. Kuang book!!The synopsis of this book immediately hooked me and I’ve been seeing reallyyyy good things 👀
7891381570	1,5⭐Dzięki tej książce zacząłem doceniać audiobooki, bo gdyby nie on, to chyba padłbym na pysk.Recenzja: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGSlP...
7397049382	2.5/5boring. flavorless. devastatingly average. i was lowkey fighting demons to make myself get through those last few chapters. so much of the plot felt like aimless meandering with philosophical interjections and reflections on the state of academia, the meaning of life, etc., but without any real substance or depth to it. i'm also shocked by how rf kuang was able to make Hell Itself appear so bland and lame and featureless - despite all the hullaballoo around the eight courts of hell, alice and peter pretty much just stroll through them. whatever little obstacles they face are easily resolved and it's only in the last third of the book that hell actually starts feeling dangerous. to be fair though, it's clear this book isn't about the journey through hell as much as it is a character study of our protagonist alice law - and the hell depicted here is obviously meant to reflect/challenge her own flaws, desires, nightmares, what she feels about academia and her place in the world. which makes it unfortunate that she just isn't that interesting of a character, at least to me. i didn't mind reading about her, i sympathized and hurt for her in many instances but ultimately, she didn't stand out to me and her motivations for going to hell just felt so flimsy. her relationship with peter was equally unconvincing, mostly because we only see the real meat of their relationship summarized in flashbacks instead of seeing it fleshed out in the moment. also, i think it's a bit misleading to label this book as a 'romance' or 'romantasy' (as i see goodreads has done). the romance isn't even a subplot here, it's really just crumbs. a couple of things i liked about this book: the magic system with magicians creating paradoxes to enact magic was fun, i always enjoy seeing a scientific, academic approach to magic. the writing style was solid and very readable, and i thought the ending was as satisfying as it could be.
7812807119	“What Alice needed most then was a nice long holiday, and then perhaps institutionalization at some remote facility near the sea.” Rating: ⭐⭐⭐,5This was as good as it was boring. Almost everything was amazing, exactly what anyone would expect from any R.F. Kuang book. The plot, the character arcs, the chemistry between the protagonists, ✨THE LORE✨, they were all so well thought out.There are only a few authors these days who could come close to Kuang's world-building and character development. She built a Hell that was entirely made up of the oldest and most famous stories and myths in literature, and it worked so well. She also created characters that were so irritatingly relatable. I wanted to be annoyed at the things they did, especially with Alice, but I couldn't because I knew I would most likely behave the same way. Not to mention that even though the romance was clearly the subplot, it was so well written that it could've stolen the spotlight had the main plot and lore not been so epic.However, it quickly became obvious that this should've been about 200 pages shorter. The chapters shifted from the present to the past, slowly revealing important plot points. I wouldn't have any problem with that whatsoever, had the chapters from the past been much shorter and didn't include such an overload of unnecessary information. It just took forever to get to the point, and at times, it made it almost impossible to stay focused.I think I would still recommend this book, regardless of "the filler chapters". They definitely annoyed me, but in the end, it was worth it to me. The story was just that good.

This author is surely a genius, and this book, like most of her work, has the feel of a modern day classic. If you don’t enjoy classic literature, you may not enjoy this book. Personally classic literature is a bit hit or miss for me, and while I can appreciate it for what it is, they’re rarely my favorite reads. This pretty much sums up my feelings on this book. The premise was actually really interesting, but the pacing could have been better IMO. Even some of the more action packed scenes honestly felt kind of dull, and parts of this book were really hard for me to get through. If you’re looking for romance, look elsewhere because it clearly isn’t this authors forte. I think this was her first attempt at romance and the set up had potential but ultimately the spark just wasn’t there. I didn’t expect it to be the focus but I did want to feel their connection more strongly. I think the FMC was meant to feel imperfect and somewhat unlikable, but I would have liked to see a little more character growth from her. I also thought the ending was a bit anticlimactic. I would have preferred for the characters to have found their way back on their own vs. what was actually written which felt more like a negotiation. All things considered, I think this was an impressive book, but it wasn’t my favorite. I personally don’t think this is this authors best work, but I’m sure it will be a 5 star read for many. ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼Pre-read: I’m not as excited about this one as the super fans, but I do think it might end up being my favorite book by this author so far.

7351870409	DNF @ 20%.Not gonna subject myself to this any longer. A review of the 20% I read: I could tell if I carried on I would be bored to tears. It felt like the transcript of someone who lovessss to hear themselves talk telling a story. Kuang's obsession with academia is exhausting. All of Hell and everyone here is a lifetime scholar? BFFR, it was just so narrow minded. There was no effort to make it even a little bit realistic or include a world outside of academia. Like we get it, Rebecca, you did lots of school, you know lots of things, you're really smart?? My broader review: I know I am in the minority big time here, but I'm just not a fan of RF Kuang's writing and I actively dislike it actually. I've read The Poppy War, Yellowface, and Babel and did not have favorable opinions of any of them by the end. But Kuang always lures me in with an incredibly interesting premise and so I find myself wasting time with her yet again. Katabasis is dense, boring, and pretentious, just like the rest of her work. I feel like all of Kuang's main characters are interchangeable, they can be plucked and swapped from their original stories and into any of the others. Alice (Katabasis) and Robin (Babel) are nearly identical and Rin (The Poppy War) could easily be substituted for either. June (Yellowface) even fits easily into Rin's shell if you can stretch your imagination to ignore context. And with this in mind, I come to the same conclusion that I have at the end of every RF Kuang book and it's that, she writes herself into all her protagonists...to their detriment. She seems to fill them with her own insecurities, whiny petulance, and hubris. Being a scholar doesn't make you interesting and Kuang writes like it absolutely does. It feels like her stories all pander to the idea of exposing a system or construct that favors the majority/oppressor, but it comes from the mouth of someone who happily benefits from that same system. There's something very hypocritical about her writing. It's most obvious in Yellowface, a book dedicated to pissing and moaning about the industry of which she is a darling. A position that was arguably handed to her by the shallow masses of social media, so not even traditionally earned. All of her protagonists (and herself if would seem) function as if the world owes them something just for being who they are. The hubris...maybe that's my real issue with her writing. Idk something is just so off about her overall message. I'm not eloquent enough to parse it out effectively...but suffice it to say I just get bad vibes. TL;DR: Katabasis is boring af. I will not be picking up any more R.F. Kuang books going forward. For real this time lol.Thanks to the publisher for my advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

6365145925	4.75⭐️ Thank you SO MUCH to the amazing Harper Collins and their wonderful team for gifting me an ARC in exchange for an honest review. [I will probably be editing this over time]This one is for the classic lit fans, the Greek and Roman nerds, for the dark academia lovers and most importantly, this book is for the GIRLS. Katabasis is everything that it was promised. A story about 2 post grad students, Alice and Peter, who go to hell to bring back their professor because they need him to write a recommendation letter for them to get a job. This story is written in RFK fashion. And we know this because of the brilliant writing, the vivid imagery and her thought provoking prose. The dark academia was dark academiaing in this book. But this is unlike anything she’s written before. This is a very ADULT book with real world ADULT problems. There are words used in here that made me say “REBECCA. DID YOU REALLY JUST FUCKING WRITE THAT?!” I was not expecting some of the lines she threw at me. She said this book was the most emotionally hardest books she ever written and it very much shows. In Alice’s POV, RFK shows us how HARD it is to be a woman of color in a male dominated field. How women have to work 2-3 more harder to get the recognition they deserve. And how toxic the relationship is between an older professor and a young woman of color in the academia world. Also the subtle SHADE that Rebecca threw in here was CHEFS KISSExample 1:“Most schools had stopped offering magicians tenure when it came apparent that their research were more interested in the trivial and esoteric than producing anything useful or profitable…” - On this specific page, RFK writes how the field of “magick” and being a magician is something that’s kind of frowned upon. To me, in this particular part, Alice resembles RFK as an author/ writer. How people scrutinize her as an POC author. We see a little bit of this in Yellowface (the shade I’m referring to)and how publishing only pushes out what’s profitable and what’s in trend. Example 2:Peter: “… I don’t know, taking into account when they were written, and the author’s social context, and such.” Alice: “historicalization Murdoch, that’s what we call it. What, do you just take everything you read at face value?”- TO ME. This was RFK throwing shade at TPW haters. Call me delusional. Now let’s talk about the beautiful romantic subplot that had me giddy. Peter and Alice’s banter was so mf cute my heart could not handle. Peter is such a hot nerd. I literally want him to slap my hand and tell me to rewrite his name 8000 times. Now I did end up giving it 4.75 stars. And that’s becaussseeee IM A PUSSY ASS BITCH YALL. but also yall knew that right?! I do NOT read or watch horror and my number one fear in life is death. You gave me a horror book about what happens after death?? Yeah. I was scared and uncomfortable for 75% of this book. But the pay off was extremely worth it. Because why focus on what happens AFTER DEATH when you can focus on the NOW? If you’re not finding the goodness in life then are you really living? If you’re not happy then what is the point? “There was no answer, only wondrous and inexplicable grace, and the only thing to do in return was to simply live.”Other than the horror elements and the essential crisis the book put me through. The pay off was extremely worth it. I am very happy with it. And I cannot wait for everyone to read it.
7001381105	⭐️ 4.5 / 5Мені ще треба час, щоб переварити все, що я щойно прочитала, але одне знаю точно — мені дуже сподобалося 🔥 Ребекка Кван вкотре доводить, що геніальне може бути простим. «Катабасис» написаний напрочуд зрозумілою мовою, без зайвої пишномовності, але з глибокими й болючими сенсами. Авторка піднімає стільки соціальних, моральних і особистісних питань, що іноді здається, всі можливі теми вже є в цій книзі. Але водночас вони не лежать на поверхні — треба зануритись, подумати, розібратись.Я читала цю книжку разом із книжковим клубом, і це, мабуть, найкращий спосіб її читати. Обговорення допомагають побачити те, чого не помічаєш сам. Доречі, якщо щось здається незрозумілим — не лінуйтесь гуглити. Авторка напряму вказує джерела відсилок, але зрозуміти, чому саме ці образи й тексти вона вибрала окреме задоволення.Фінал мені сподобався трохи менше. Не можу сказати, що він зіпсував враження, просто видався або занадто простим, або занадто передбачуваним, ніби не зовсім на рівні решти історії. Але це дрібниця в порівнянні з тим, наскільки мені близький стиль Кван. Після «Катабасису» я впевнена, що б вона не написала далі, я читатиму все.Якщо порівнювати з «Вавилоном», то «Вавилон» мені сподобався трохи більше. Можливо, просто через те, що тематика там була мені ближчою. Але «Катабасис» — це, без перебільшення, книжка, яка залишає слід. І є вірогідність, що я ще не раз зміню цей відгук, коли трохи більше її обдумаю.
7883491776	«Katabasis» is a paradox: a book so desperate to be profound that it ends up saying absolutely nothing. Every page strains under the weight of its own cleverness, as though style alone could substitute for substance. Spoiler—it can’t.The prose is mock-academic to the point of parody, endlessly circling itself in self-referential loops. Characters are less people than megaphones, shouting Kuang’s arguments until the whole thing collapses into a lecture dressed up as a novel. The narrative, meanwhile, trudges along like it knows it doesn’t matter.Reading this was like watching someone congratulate themselves in real time—dense where it should be deep, smug where it should be smart. Kuang confuses paradox for brilliance, but the only true paradox here is how something so overwritten can feel so empty.One star, because even pretension should at least be entertaining.
6468060060	ⵌ݁ 5 stars ★⤿ no spoilers.ᐟ you thought the world was one way and then it wasn’t. one could become zero. one could become two. a blink of an eye, and the fact of the matter was not. if the world could be fluid for you once, how many more times could you make it dance according to your whims? hell really is other people!this was fantastic, and i absolutely loved it. it's a book that's unapologetically pretentious, layered with mythology, philosophical conundrums, references to classical literature, history, and math. this is true dark academia, with discussions on classism, racism, misogyny, power dynamics, and the soul-sucking nature of academia. it discusses grief, and shows how abuse can twist someone's mind. there's depictions of depression, suicide, imposter syndrome, and being so fixated on something that you can't see life beyond it. there's no dramatic plot twists or extreme adventure—it's a quiet journey through hell with a lot of soul searching, both literally and figuratively. an unexamined life is not worth living, as socrates tells us. katabasis is the kind of book that needs to be read slowly and analyzed. it is info-dumpy and i LOVED it!! i was looking up stuff every few pages and i've learnt so much. you do not need to read dante's inferno or be a master in philoshopy to enjoy this book, everything is well explained and kuang's prose is incredibly accessible. “oh, the horror! oh, to not be clever” the magic system was so unique and interesting! it's built on paradoxes, math, and philosophical theories and involves chalk and pentagrams, which was so cool to read about. i'd read an entire textbook on this world. it was so fascinating how the magic was nothing supernatural or otherworldy—because math and philosophy is magic in itself, that when believed in, can tip the entire fabric of reality. to be a magician was to be that tortoise racing achilles; deluding himself, as the runner loomed larger behind him, that space and time would hang still so that he might stay ahead. the characters were incredibly realistic. alice and peter are both deeply flawed characters. alice is obsessed with academia, recognition, and glory, and that obsession is slowly destroying her. she has a lot of internalized misogyny and prejudices to unlearn. she is unlikable at times, and jumps to conclusions quickly, but she is utterly human. i won't say much about peter, because slowly learning about him and unpacking his character throughtout the book was the best part. they're both amazing characters—delusional and utterly fucked up. this book is an exploration of their psychology, of their deepest self. it truly feels like you are on this journey to hell with them. she would sacrifice her firstborn for a professorial post. she would sever a limb. she would give anything, so long as she still had her mind, so long as she could still think. alice and peter's emotional spiral was done so well. the narrative structure follows the classic hero's journey—they need to completely lose their minds, utterly break apart, sink to the lowest of the low, before they can start to rebuild themselves. they're on the verge of insanity since the beginning, trapped in the suffocating box of university, unable to focus on anything aside from success. and only when they go to hell and all structure and reasoning breaks apart can they finally unravel. “christ,” said peter. “hell is a campus.” this is a love story! alice and peter are true rivals to lovers. they know each other inside out, have seen the best and worst sides of themselves. they truly are made for each other. the romance is NOT a huge part of the story at all. no dramatic love confessions or makeouts in hell, sorry. it's there, but it is very much just a subplot, and that subplot is beautiful. i love them so much <3 she gazed at peter and thought, i wish i were the night, so that i might watch your sleep with a thousand eyes. i have SO many more thoughts but i don't think i can put them into words. overall, this was very clever, gripping, and a must-read. i will be thinking about this book for a long time. “lines that are parallel meet at infinity!”euclid repeatedly, heatedly, urgeduntil he died.and so reached that vicinity: in it he found that the damned things diverged.—PIET HEIN, “PARALLELISM” · · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·
7870854915	☆☆☆☆R.F. Kuang’s Katabasis is another ambitious, deeply layered project, much like her previous work Babel. It’s a book that thrives on being both intellectual and pretentious, yet it remains undeniably enjoyable. You can really feel the immense amount of work and knowledge Kuang poured into this book, and I deeply appreciate the depth and research that shine through every page. Her ability to blend intricate world-building with thought-provoking ideas is truly impressive.One of the book's strongest aspects is the relationship between Peter and Alice. Their shared and individual histories unfold gradually, creating a compelling emotional depth to their characters. I found myself truly invested in their journey, especially as their pasts and personal struggles became more intertwined.That said, Katabasis does have its flaws. The pacing, in particular, feels uneven—especially in the last quarter of the novel, where things seem to drag on longer than necessary. This slower section left me feeling a bit detached, which is why, unfortunately, I couldn’t give it the 5-star rating I was hoping for. I’d been eagerly anticipating this book for 2025, and while it lived up to many of my expectations, the pacing issues did take a bit of the shine off.Also, a quick trigger warning: there are mentions of animal experimentation, which might be distressing to some readers.Overall, though, Katabasis is still a strong and thought-provoking read, and I would absolutely recommend it to fans of Kuang’s previous work. If you appreciate novels that are intellectually stimulating and willing to take risks, this one is definitely worth your time, despite a few pacing missteps.
7461361185	⭐️ 3 ⭐️ You need a course in philosophy, physics and astrophysics in order to fully understand this book. It reads like a long dissertation paper on philosophical matter and is quite an overreach. This book is not for everyone as it’s very difficult to understand and follow. When I have to be googling things from almost every page (references to Gods, paradoxes, philosophical matter, etc) it takes me out of the story and just reduces my concentration. It literally was like walking through a philosophical zigzag where I was lost and confused and possibly feeling stupid? The immense amount of research that went into this book is astounding. It’s commendable and honestly elevates any type of work/writing in my opinion. However, it is not for everyone. Aside from all the philosophical weirdness, Katabasis had a plot and a very interesting one—that part was completely readable and understandable. I loved the entire dynamic between Alice and Peter, their quirky moments, their relationship. I loved how in between all the deep prose, R.F. Kuang threw in some comedic elements. It definitely lightened up the mood. Katabasis, which literally translates to “descent” or “going down” into the underworld was a trip that wasn’t overly memorable or exciting. I’m not a philosopher, I don’t do logic. I wanted to be fully immersed but ended up spaced out. *Full review to follow *
7261318921	This isn't a book for readers, this is a book for pretentious asshats that think of themselves as 'scholars'.The hype for this book was real - I hadn't read any of this author's books before but The Poppy War is a favourite of my good friend Juliette so we were both hanging for this and were lucky enough to get ARCs from Harper Collins.So this was a Buddy Read with Juliette.A journey to Hell sounds like just my kind of premise, and this book started by taking us straight there with Alice Law and her fellow student/colleague, Peter. Magic(k) in this world mostly involves drawing pentagrams and reciting absurd paradoxes so a little of that and away we go.So let's get it out of the way: this book made a journey to Hell about as exciting as sitting through a lecture on the scientific properties of dry paint.Although, to be fair, science is much more interesting than this awful, bland blend of mathematics, linguistics and philosophy. Almost immediately, the narrative switches to flashbacks detailing how hard Alice worked as a student under Grimes, and goes on (and on, and on, and on ...) about word puzzles, paradoxes, mathematical properties and implications regarding Hell and all manner of pointless things in between. A little bit tested the brain so at the start I didn't mind so much, but as the book went on and all this extra stuff took precedence over the continuation of the story I became increasingly frustrated. We get about three chapters of this random, way-over-my-head crap for every chapter of actual journeying through Hell. The average reader is not going to be interested in this amount of superfluous speculation. GET TO THE GOOD STUFF ALREADY.Sadly, even 'good stuff' is a stretch because, Kuang's Hell? It's all flat, monotonous plains and other ridiculously dull iterations that I won't mention just for spoilers-sake. There is no kind of LIFE in her story - no demons or devils, no fire and brimstone, no pitchforks or pits or meaningful monsters. The creativity she does develop in this area is washed away easily by those other chapters of random stuff I mentioned, meaning there's really not much exciting about their journey at all.This is a book about a PHD student who is just the BESTEST STUDENT EVER. She's Not Like Other Girls because she doesn't mind being treated like a piece of crap by her advisor because it's all totally worth it: one day she's going to get A Really Good Job out of it.Honestly? The whole 'student life' she detailed was depressing AF but, with Kuang being a PHD student herself, I can only assume we're supposed to admire Alice's dedication to a life entirely devoid of anything other than her studies. I myself felt sorry for her lack of living, but that wasn't a subject that really made its way into this book the way it should have.So then we have the 'magick' which mostly amounts to a whole lot of nothing. It felt a stretch to refer to it as magic since it's just chalk drawings and paradoxes and there's no real decent explanation of how it all works. Basically, it's maths. 'Just be okay with it' is kind of the message here. Magic has never been less interesting to me.Finally, the whole reason for Alice and Peter going after Grimes was POINTLESS. Allow me to veer into SPOILER territory:(view spoiler)[Both claim they want to get Grimes back because he's their only hope of landing a good job. But then it turns out that Alice wants to bring him back as some kind of ridiculous revenge, and Peter just feels guilty because he believes he's the reason Grimes died. Given the level of sacrifice that needed to be made by both, I found neither of these things plausible. I also LOATHED the sexual assault because it was such a trope moment - this book is supposed to be telling a different kind of story and you still had to have this same student/teacher rapey BULLSHIT??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I was so mad reading it. It's such an old, tired crutch for authors to lean on, to give their characters A Bad Time. There was nothing clever in the way it was done. It was just shoved in to make some kind of point that made zero sense to the whole plot of this book. (hide spoiler)]Essentially, this book had zero reason to exist because the premise thins to nothing as the book goes on.In the same line of thinking, a quick comment on the 'romance' this book is promoted as: what romance? There is some awkward smooshing of Alice and Peter's feelings here and there but nothing about their relationship feels organic. It's more like she threw in a little bit just so this book could cash in on the current trend of 'Romantasy.' I'm not even into romance and I found this relationship dull. And communication misunderstandings is one of my least favourite things in any book - JUST TALK TO EACH OTHER FFS.Don't get me started on the additional pointlessness of the fking CAT.This started out as a four star read for me, but dropped dramatically to a place of loathing. I wanted so badly for it to meet the high expectations I had for it, but it ended up turning me off Kuang completely. I've heard it mentioned that she believes people who don't like her books 'just don't get it' so I guess I'll happily admit she would think I'm a dumbass. Because this book was terrible.I'm throwing it a bonus star for keeping me curious for the first hundred or so pages, but it's more of a pity star and an apology to Harper for such a hate-filled review of a book they so generously provided.With thanks to Harper Collins for an ARC
7377301104	rfk please put down the textbooks and bibliographies, i’m begging you !! no one is more sad than i am that my most anticipated read for the last 3 years fell flat. this disappointment is perhaps partially my fault. my expectations for a new book from rf kuang were too high, and as you can see, i did not enjoy my time reading this book. i imagine what i experienced was akin to how it feels to crawl through hell one of my least favourite storylines in books is the quest trope: i hate making our way along a journey to retrieve an item (in this case a person) as i usually find my self dragging through the pages until we can finally get to the conclusion. it did not help that hell was made boring and monotonous. i was not attached to either alice or peter, especially not in the way i usually am to rfk’s characters. why this is extra damning, is that you spend the whole time with them. so if you aren’t clicking with your main characters, and there aren’t really any other characters to lock onto…who’s flying the plane? you don’t get any character depth, learn their motivations, backstories and history until very far in, so i spent way more than half of the book emotionally detached from them.one of my critiques with babel was the amount of info dumping not relevant to the story; somehow this book was even more excessive. the writing truly was so exposition heavy with the plot taking a back seat. i was frustrated because i could really feel this book’s length. i hate to say it, but this felt like rebecca’s weakest writing to date. the commentary on the way academia destroys you from the inside out - even more so as a woman of colour, written by someone as academically accomplished as rebecca, should have made this book a stand out. however, by the time these themes came into play, i was too detached to care after being inundated by a narrative that read 65% textbook. i sold my soul to rfk when i read the poppy war in 2020, which means i will read anything this woman writes. unfortunately, this one i will not remember fondly. in fact, i don’t believe that i will think of it again! but, hey, at least i will always leave an rfk book learning some obscure facts.
6414473014	RF Kuang, the writer that you are. Yellowface, and then this??? I haven't even finished it yet but I could already rate it 5 stars. I'm DEVOURING it. PLEASE TELL ME MORE ABOUT PENTAGRAMS AND LOGIC AND PARADOXES AND HISTORY AND CAMBRIDGE AND WHATEVER YOU WANT TO TELL ME, JUST TELL ME. Especially about Peter. Tell me about Peter :))I went it with humongous expectations and they were surpassed.*Later edit: finished. Gorg. And what an interesting magic system.
7899525510	Alice Law wants to graduate in Magick with the highest honors and a recommendation from the greatest professor. That’s her golden ticket to success. Unfortunately, the professor died. And she was responsible for the accident that killed him.But just because he’s dead, that doesn’t mean her dream needs to be. She’s going to visit him in Hell. But her rival has the same idea.What a cool concept. This is a story that is basically one big criticism on elite academic institutions. But it’s not just about the institutions, it’s about the people there, or even better: how much people change because of those institutions.This is a character-driven story, but it’s worth mentioning that these aren’t the kind of people you’ll want to root for. Linda Ronstadt may have sung that it's so easy to fall in love, but R.F. Kuang proves that it’s also quite easy to dislike some fictional characters. The thing is that the main character Alice in particular has sacrificed so much of herself, that there’s barely anything left but unresolved trauma and an obsessive addiction to external validation. Part of that is the attitude of the scholars in general. They look down on anything that distracts from the life of the mind and they pride themselves on dedicating their lives completely to their research. And you can see that Alice discovers how wrong she’s been when she starts to question her idol, the professor she’s trying to find in Hell.For some reason, this book didn’t grab me as much as I was expecting it to. There is something to be said about the characters, but they’re supposed to be unlikeable. It’s a very complex read that requires quite a bit of academic knowledge to fully appreciate it, but that’s part of what makes this an interesting read. You could also say that there are quite a few flashbacks. Flashback always take you out of the story at hand for a bit, so it’s best not to use them too often. But honestly, everything is written well and serves a purpose. Objectively speaking, this story does a lot of things right. Subjectively speaking though, I just felt a bit bored and I never really cared about the characters. Maybe this is just not my kind of story.Overall, a unique concept with a strong but complex execution that makes it stand out. The characters are deliberately unlikable, but also interesting in their own right. Unfortunately, this never really grabbed me. Don’t let one reader’s opinion stop you from reading and enjoying this one though, as it has some cool things to offer.
6466066316	RIVALS TO LOVERS IN HELLi can understand why people don’t like this but it definitely worked for me!
7980318890	While reading this book, I thought about RF Kuang. Not as a person, as an entity, a presence, a space in the wider conversation about books, genre, the concept of "having things to say", and so on. That's primarily because the book was too dull to provide engaging thought on its own, but I digress. This is the second of her big releases to focus on academia, and The Poppy War had a fair emphasis on it as well. Kuang has been a student for a long time. This seems only natural that she would have things to say about it, and while Babel was far from my favorite book, it had a point of view, things to say, concepts to engage with, prose that occasionally felt poignant, some measure of intrigue and stakes. So why does Katabasis regress in every category? Both of these books -strike that, all Kuang books- are filled with rage. That is the through line of every word of prose Rebecca Kuang has ever written - rage. But there comes a point during any outburst of rage where you no longer have new thoughts about the reason you're angry, you are merely working yourself up over and over again in different ways because your nervous system is not ready to relax, not ready to let it go, your rage has not been satiated or validated yet and so you grasp onto that famous phrase of the angry - "AND ANOTHER THING....!!!". Eventually, someone hands us a cup of tea or a beer or gives us a hug and says, "yeah, that really sucks". And you no longer need to tell us about another thing. Katabasis is the literary "and another thing" that has no clue what it wants to say, no coherence or cohesion, just blindly throwing things into the narrative with no larger picture of how to integrate these concepts. Rebecca. It really sucks that academia is so toxic. It sounds hard, and unfair, and sexist, and racist, and no doubt you and many other graduate students feel a giant ball of injustice in your chest when you think about how unfair it all is. Now can we move on? Katabasis is a metaphor made literal, with no shocking twists, no interesting concepts, no rehashing of older ideas in new ways, no compelling characters, no satisfying arcs or exciting challenges or really much of anything besides "academia is hell". Literally. And it occasionally tries to grapple with interesting topics, things that for just a brief moment, I was like, "oh, this new idea will be interesting", only for it to consistently choose the least interesting route. Alice, our MC, is one of the most insufferable characters I've ever read about, yet I am never left with an impression that I am supposed to dislike her, merely scold her gently for her worst traits (like hating those sluts who had the audacity to sleep with their professor, whom she also wants to sleep with) and accept that while rough around the edges, her goal of entering hell to rescue her professor so he can write a recommendation letter is a noble one. But don't worry, folks! Alice will be humbled by nice guy Peter. Humbled, simply by being in his presence for a large portion of this book and them both talking about random bits of philosophy or history or literature just to show that Kuang has read them too. There is no tangent too tangential to be included in "and another thing", that's what another things are for. This "enemies to lovers" is only that on the strictest, more bare bones of technicalities, mostly these two are together for them to both randomly get character growth without earning it. Another review said the book has "proximity dressed up as intimacy" and I have never felt a slam dunk of a line so keenly. These two bond and change simply because the narrative demands it. The book is first person from Alice's POV and reveals backstory in almost "throwing a dart"-esque fashion. There are so many valid ways to reveal information throughout a story, but the narrator telling you a small sliver of the story and then 200 pages later going, in internal monologue, "actually here's the rest of the story" which paints everything in a new light is boring and artificial. This isn't presented in an unreliable narrator type of way, simply "we are now a third of the way through the book, so I need to reveal more information about Alice's relationship with the professor" is so evidently the driving force that I was annoyed every time. This is not how internal monologues work. If I am thinking about why I like or dislike a person, I think about the biggest reasons in either direction first. I don't think "yeah, George is kinda shitty, he left my text on read last week" and then three days later remember, "oh yeah, George also shot my brother in the face". Also this book has lembas bread. Actually. Lembas bread, from Lord of the Fucking Rings. They go to hell, and say, man I'm hungry, lets eat some lembas. What in the absolute fuck is going on here. Did Kuang write the whole book, realize they never ate something, have two days to fix this in revision, and go, "screw it, lembas bread, as made famous in Lord of the Rings by most famous fantasy author of all time, JRR Tolkien, that will be fine"? This is absurd and I'm so infuriated that nobody else is talking about this. I demand an explanation. The resolution of this book is trite and unearned, every level of hell is the most boring, easy, uninteresting route. There is a cat, though, so not everything is pure misery. You could just watch the movie Whiplash instead of reading this book. Whiplash is two hours and handles the questions, "how far does one go in pursuit of being the absolute best, what do they give up to do so? How far does one go as an educator to coax greatness out of someone, how far is too far? What should be the consequences of either of these decisions?" much better than this book does and you might even feel some stakes or sense of tension in that movie instead of being lulled into your slow death by the 80th reference to Dante or Borges or Hume or whatever. AND ANOTHER THING!! The lembas bread!! You couldn't have just renamed it!? Keep it the same but call it Kuang Bread? Rage Bread? Sabmel bread? Anything!! 2/10
7224630738	Katabasis is a University English student's dream come true. If I were still in graduate school, I would have written about it. Yes, understanding the ideas in this novel might be a hiccup for younger or less experienced readers unwilling to type allusions into google. But come on, the day that an author can no longer count on readers to take two seconds to bloody well look up elementary allusions is the same day I'll lose interest in reading. You don't need a background in the western and eastern literary canons to enjoy a book with allusions--you just need to be willing to look up whatever you don't recognize. Brief Summary:Alice Law and Peter Murdoch, both Cambridge graduate students in the most challenging field of magical studies, transport themselves to Hell in order to rescue their deceased academic advisor, Professor Grimes. This particular professor is one of the most respected scholars in his field, and without him, both students feel that all of their academic toiling will have been wasted. So despite the steep price, they magic themselves into Hell. The majority of the novel details the various realms of Hell through which Alice and Peter must travel. Extended Metaphor, Wit & Humor:Surely by now, you are wondering if this book is an updated version of Dante. Nope. Of course Dante's works are referenced, but this novel is essentially a conceit--one giant allegorical metaphor--and it absolutely oozes the most delicious wit. When I first started, I had no idea that I was in for such fantastic hilarity. I hadn't read anything about the humor here at all. But the puns begin immediately, and it quickly becomes obvious that Kuang is making fun of everything we take too seriously. If as a student this ever applied to you, if you endured countless sleepless nights in service to your grade point average, if you poured over practice sites to obtain perfect standardized test scores and revised obsessively to win academic awards and scholarships; then this novel is your chance for catharsis...your chance to laugh. In Katabasis, Kuang takes on academia, the western canon, and even America. I laughed out loud at least once every three pages, and the moment I hit the last page, I flipped right back to the beginning for a reread. Style & Structure:Kuang's prose here is expertly sculpted. In fact, Katabasis represents an improvement over her prose style in Babel. She seems to have completely mastered organically allowing the sentence structure to imitate the tone and thus influence the reader's mood. Her diction, never high handed and never purple, is exquisitely measured and timed. One of my favorite opening sections details why our protagonist intends to make a quite dangerous rescue attempt. She introduces the local color of her magic system with several eclectic names for laws and principles, makes several subtly humorous allusions to Dante and TS Elliott. And then, at the end of the paragraph, Kuang adds bluntly and plainly, "this meant she had to go to hell, and she had to go today." It's the first time such simple diction has been used in this paragraph, and it's just the perfect touch. Another example of Kuang's evolved use of organic structure occurs when she uses repetition to emote exactly the opposite of what is said. To clarify, when Kuang offers exposition on Alice's conflict, she repeats the opening phrase of descriptive sentences. "No one saw" Alice's involvement in her professor's death, and "no one saw" when she took off her bloody clothes, and "no one saw" her incinerate them. The phrase "no one saw" is repeated multiple times throughout the paragraph. It's repeated so often that readers begin to doubt the validity of the phrase. They begin to understand that Alice is worried about just the opposite--that someone must have seen. Each time the phrase is repeated, the anxiety builds. Readers sincerely feel Alice's fear, her need to reassure herself, and the emotion is so much stronger because it is indirectly conveyed by structure instead of being merely stated. Kuang's prose depicts exactly the artistry possible when authors wield a mastery of grammar and form. There's nothing pedantic or even didactic in the descriptions. They are just as carefully crafted as the sentence structure. Ignore the one star reviews that say otherwise. This is the sort of novel that belongs on Locus Award nomination lists. Katabasis is literature. Further Thoughts:Kuang's books have always offered readers a carefully laid out symbology. But Katabasis is next level. Her motifs weave thematic layers upon layers so perfectly that the ending tapestry is a marvel. Bluntly, I can't even understand how brilliant one would have to be to pull off something like this. It's that sort of book--the sort you want to spend months deconstructing just so you can polish your own awe into language. I had not originally intended to write a review for this one, mainly because it's already so widely reviewed, but I have seen such a baffling smear campaign against what is essentially Kuang's most impressive work to date, that I felt compelled after a second reading to throw in my two cents. I really urge fantasy lovers, especially academic fantasy lovers, not to miss out. Of all the hardcovers on which I have spent far too much coin, this is one first edition I will never regret. This book is beautiful beyond its colorful jacket and sprayed edges. Bottomline: If you are a reader of literature, then you will love this book. If you are used to the average national bestseller, no problem--you can still love this book. Just go into it with a search engine at the ready and take your time. It's worth it.
7299764467	3.5magicians?—academic rivals with murderous tendencies on a trip to hell. sign me tf up! conceptually, this should’ve been my read of the year, but sike! oh well. first off, the worldbuilding is grandeur! leave it to rf kuang to sculpt hell into an enigmatic, arcane, wasteland-esque, reverse utopia. i wish i could project the images i’ve conjured onto this review (especially of lethe). oh, i was invested… but unfortunately, i’m biased. and it’s neither fair nor right, but peteralice suffer from second child syndrome when it comes to couples embarking on a journey through hell. i knew their romantic buildup wasn’t gonna center the plot, but they truly invoked nothing in me—until my eyes suddenly started watering by the end of the book, so there’s that. if anything, i was way more invested in alice’s dynamics with everyone else, and i get why rf kuang calls this her ‘most emotionally difficult book’—she really goes in-depth how alice’s relationships shape her, how they dictate her actions, how they weigh on her. which were the parts of the book i couldn’t put down. give me a complex fmc, and i’m sat. she approached this book in a very academic way, as she always does. however, contrary to babel, this felt more like an info dump than a dramatic narrative.to speak my absolute truth, a trip to hell shouldn’t be this… lame? we were practically spoon-fed a nothingburger with a side of „what could’ve been“, which is tragic given its potential. and yet, despite all that, i had a good time. i went in blind, skipped all the pre-reading, and still caught every reference—a testament to just how sharp rf kuang’s writing is. if you’re looking for escapism, i guess this is the book for you!hopefully, this wasn’t too discouraging. i’m looking forward to everyone’s thoughts on this x
7239257403	i’m in pieces, sobbing at the mere perfection of this novel. rtc when i can collect my thoughts, but all of my already impossibly high expectations were exceeded in explosive fashion. remarkable, truly remarkable. new favourite r.f. kuang novel and the book to beat this year - maybe even this decade.
6371134521	Book bliss. The type that opens your mind mesmerically. Everything that is depicted upon these pages is, a wondrous wealth of knowledge that keeps accumulating until the end. Just to convince yall, even though it’s heavy in terms of the amount of information being supplied, it is not nerdily pretentious where it feels overwhelming, but undeniably enthralling. Multiple philosophical ideologies. Paradoxes. Contradictions. Geometrical designs. Riddles. Axioms and so much more. It makes you question, dissect, and savor the way you muse. On top of that, two characters with flawless character development. Emotion in every adventure, that is to be felt as read. I offer my services to anyone who reads this and needs clarity, cause I indeed can yap about this and explain it for days while excitingly hearing the opinions of others, of course 😂. A gem. One I’m obsessed with. ✍️🖤.
7334853846	Absolutely book of the year!!!!Maybe it's because it's so well written. Maybe it's because it makes you think about life, death, school, mental health, love, and what we truly desire. Maybe it's because it references philosophy, mythology, mathematics, and literature—layered with theories, paradoxes, and illusions. Maybe it's because the magic system is literally programming propositional logic (even though my brain can't do math, logic, or anything that comes with it to save my life) into pentagrams using chalk. Or maybe it's just that I had a fantastic fucking time. There isn't a single thing about this book that I don't love. Katabasis is funny, thoughtful, absurd, and adventurous. R.F. Kuang's writing is on another level—evocative, poetic, informative, ironic, bitter, hilarious, cutting, disturbing, guilty, hopeful, sharp, deliberate, elegant yet merciless—it's everything. Her depiction of hell is eerie, unsettling, and deeply fascinating. She draws from classic literature and great philosophers to create her own underworld and the magic that exists within it.I get that this is not for everyone, but by god, it was for me.
7093025974	”You know very well what a heap is. You know it when you see it. It’s like porn.”two months after reading this sentence i found out it’s (probably) a reference to some dude from Halo saying “It’s kind of like porn. You know it when you see it.” but even with that context the sentence above makes zero sense. really burns into your memory though. i don’t have anything nice to say about Katabasis and honestly, i don’t care enough to speak about it at length. i found it a tedious reading experience, made marginally better by switching to the audiobook halfway through.it’s info dumping: the book. the info dumping doesn’t serve the plot, it’s just showcasing that the author knows stuff; half of this is name dropping philosophers (all men lest we risk the feminism subplot actually leading somewhere). like, great that you have four degrees and awesome that you like studying but this is just self-indulgence at its finest.also, people in academia: is it really this serious, is it really this deep. adopt a “i don’t care”-attitude at least once in a while. you don’t need to travel to hell to get half of your life span taken from you - stress and burnout can manage that as well. signed, a person who’s also in academia.

The female narrator was quite good and I enjoyed her rendition of Alice. I feel like she gave the character a lot of emotion and depth. But the random intervals of the male narrator really threw me off.

General Thoughts:Right off the bat Katabasis strikes me as much more academic based than Babel. That being said, it was still extremely accessible and easy to follow. I enjoyed the explanations woven throughout the story and found myself anxious to learn more. I did involve google to fill in gaps in my knowledge purely because I wanted to know more, not because it was needed. I did not find that my understanding or enjoyment was tempered by the fact that I have not read the works discussed in this novel. Like Dante's Inferno. Although this book did make me want to read them. I know the basic premise and I found that sufficient to enjoying Katabasis. No required reading to love this novel! The magical realism set within this world is extremely interesting and I do love the academic basis for which it's founded on. The explanations of paradox's and things of that nature really peaked my interest and I enjoyed the accessible way it was written so that I could feel on par with the characters. It did not feel pretentious or overblown like a lot of other more "academic" works I've read. I felt like the author wanted me to understand vs show off how smart they are. I think a hard point for many readers, especially readers who need to "like" their main characters will be that Alice and Peter are both pretty unlikable for a good chunk of this book. Eventually, we do learn more about their motivations, pasts and reasonings for why they come across as they do. I do believe it gives them a sense of depth that is pretty unmatched in other dark academia books. This is a very character driven tale, and you have to hold in with the characters to get the full payout. Before you get that payout you have to trust the author and remember that the character decisions might not make sense for some time because we don't know the entire story yet. I do believe this is the closest to a romance that Kuang has ever attempted. It is still not romance forward or heavy, but was a nice touch. I have seen others call this a "romance book". I disagree. This is a Dark Academia with romance in my opinion. The romance was a nice touch, it was well done and not cheesy or cringe. But I never doubted the genre while reading. Fantasy wasn't the main plot line. I did enjoy the overall storyline and plot. It was engaging and the characters were interesting. The plotline was very straightforward and not complex. This read to me as a character driven book, so I was ok with a simple plot. Go to hell. Get professor. Simple. The real fun was the characters and their development. The movement between past and present timelines were well done and I enjoyed both perspectives. They gave the characters layers and overall time I definitely grew to enjoy the characters as I learned more about them and their motivations. I felt like the world made sense and I had a good grasp on the intricacies of Hell and its inhabitants. There were some very interesting characters that I really found to be well presented and added a layer of darkness to keep the vibes going. I remain a loyal RF Kuang lover and will continue to enjoy her works. Disclaimer: I read this book as a eARC from the publisher and NetGalley and a self purchased audiobook. All opinions are my own. This is my honest and voluntary review.
7316633932	Exciting, erudite and fun with a vivid world, lore and characters. More to come later...
7216729468	I thought the hook of this book was so good, and the overall story, on paper, I think would sound like an amazing pitch. Unfortunately, for me, it didn’t play out that way. I appreciated the insights that Kuang was providing, and the connections of academia and hell, but the university layout just didn’t work for me. And most of our character’s journeys through hell also didn’t work for me.It was long enough that this should have felt like a journey, yet it didn’t. When our characters finally show their development at the end, I didn’t find that it was earned.Some really great moments though, a few standout chapters, and I still found Kuang’s writing to be beautifully eloquent.
6710913441	this book solidifies how fucking boring and tedious philosophy is to me
7293481152	4.0 StarsSpoiler Free Video Review https://youtu.be/Z0t71ZbUuv4This a slow burning, character driven novels that uses the passage through hell as an allegory for the experience of completing graduate studies. This novel is clearly written for a niche audience, as the author discusses the minute details of the blood and tears that come with higher education. I would highly recommend this one to readers who have pursued similar studies. I suspect these readers will get the most out of this story.As for other readers, I would recommend this one primarily to those who have read and love Babel. The two books are very similar in terms of themes, plot and pacing. If you did not enjoy Babel, then this one will likely generate similar feelings. Readers can start here, but as her least accessible novels, I would only recommend this book as an entry point for PhD students looking for a story that explores the dark side of higher education.
6466066374	ARC generously provided by Harpercollins/Harper Voyager! Thank you so much!4.5 stars, possibly 5 when I think it over. Dizzying in its breadth and utterly arresting in its storytelling, Katabasis is somehow at once a scholarly inquiry into paradoxes, a labyrinthine fantasy story with an academic rivals to lovers romance at its center, and a narrative that brings fresh horrors and brilliance to the literary tradition of its namesake.
7092254324	2.5 starsI’m probably going to be the only one of my friends who doesn’t care for this.Let me start by saying that Kuang absolutely can write. She is a top notch literary fiend. The problem I had with this particular book is that it felt like it was in deep conversation with itself, and didn’t much care to include me or make me want to join in. It’s densely chatty and extremely pleased with how much smarter it is than everyone else, kind of like the main characters, so it all fits in that respect.I get that graduate school is literally hell (believe me I get that); and I absolutely understand the unique problems faced by intelligent women pursuing higher academic goals and the whole old boy club that still believes dues must be paid in a certain way before one can be seen as legitimate in a chosen field. I just felt that this particular story did not engage with those issues very deeply. There is not enough actual story and too much detailed internal discussion meant to demonstrate superior intellect.The end result for me was that I felt both triggered by the traumatic experiences described, and irritated by the continual smugness and constant meaningless chatter. It had the effect of causing me to have a lot of pent up feelings but offered no way to thoughtfully resolve any of them through the vehicle of the story. I get this probably sounds weird and it is definitely a me problem, but it is the reason I ended up not enjoying this book very much.The audiobook narration is very good though, in case you were wondering.
6583516952	Katabasis, noun, Ancient Greek. The story of a hero's descent to the underworld.TL;DR: The best dark academia fantasy novel Kuang has ever written, in my humble opinion. Well worth a read, and probably a second one too. The title encapsulates what it is about on the surface, the rest is Kuang's exasperation about academia manifested in the characters, plot and worldbuilding. Flawed protagonists, intricate worldbuilding, a rollercoaster of timelines, and somehow, mathematics. Seriously, a lot of mathematics.I'm going to write paragraphs upon paragraphs here because this book is so incandescently beautiful. Making me wait for a year for this was really the ninth circle of Hell.This is the first book by R. F. Kuang that I've rated 5 stars, and the first one where I think she has perfected her style (not to say that her previous work wasn't amazing, but they probably didn't live up to their "hype", in hindsight). The flow of the prose was flawless and captivating—which is saying a lot, because this book is incredibly technical.The technical aspect of this book could be tedious for some readers, since the plot regularly digresses into intricate philosophical and mathematical rambles, so much so that the book toes the line of science fiction and fantasy, in my opinion. This is the genre I most love, though, so I landed in literary heaven. In a book about Hell, literally.Katabasis is a book aptly described by its title. It is the story of Alice Law, a graduate student from Cambridge who goes to Hell to rescue the soul of her PhD advisor. The fantasy aspect trickles in by the fact that she studies Analytic Magick (note to self: I love it when the word and aspect "analytic" is attached to anything in fantasy). Analytic Magick relies on mathematical paradoxes, and Kuang wields this as she did linguistics in Babel, with way more finesse. I love that dark academia is expanding to include math theorems. Please let that be here to stay.Alice is incredibly competitive, competent, and ambitious, all qualities I like to believe I share, and thus connect with instantly. Her problems stem from her inherent ambition, and her struggles mirror so much of what I know from people in academia. At times, her internal thoughts felt like Kuang's frustrated rants against the academic establishment, much as the rants against the book Yellowface felt like her disappointment with the publishing industry.Coming to the magic(k) and the worldbuilding, it is so sublime that I want to crack open this book again to immerse myself in it. Very few books have me wanting to reread them, or have me captivated in a few pages like this one. Magick relies on mathematics and chalk woven together, and the landscape of Hell is described using literary classics such as Dante's Inferno, Virgil's The Aeneid, and the story of Orpheus and Eurydice in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Kuang's love of university campuses is so strong, it plays a strong role in the worldbuilding, atmospheric in its own right.The characterizations are flawed and realistic, pretty evidently inspired by real people Kuang may have interacted with. Alice is by no means a perfect person, nor does she have the most squeaky-clean of intentions, but that is a regular feature of Kuang's protagonists. Not only does she go through a journey through the underworld, but also to a version of herself that she wants to achieve.I also love how this book did an adequate amount of hand-holding for the average reader to understand it. There are concepts here that people versed in philosophy and mathematics would grasp quickly and read on, but Kuang doesn't just quote-reference something and move on to the plot. She takes the time to explain it, which probably contributed to the bulk of this book. She also seesaws between timelines, which could be difficult to follow, but ultimately led to a great experience peeling back the layers of the characters. I don't think this is a book for beginner readers, even as I gush about it and recommend it wholeheartedly, but it is definitely a book to aspire to read someday. I know I will be reading it again and again.I think a major reason why I loved this book so much is that it reminded me a lot of dark-adjacent academic fantasy that I read growing up, like Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials, and included Kuang's real-life struggles and analogy hidden unsubtly in her rants about the mental and physical stress graduate students are required to undergo through their doctorates. I have a soft spot for both meticulously constructed fantasy and deeply personal insights in books. The book also incorporates (majestically, I might add) my one weakness to romance tropes, which I won't outline to avoid spoilers.Recommended to high heaven to everyone, for I believe this should be on quite a few best-of lists. Don't believe any of those prepare-to-read-Katabasis lists and dive in; this is a classic in the making, and Kuang makes it accessible by explaining everything as she goes. Although I will say, if you're the type of person to read the words "hyperbolic space" in a fiction book, and gasp with happiness (me), a special recommendation to you to read it RIGHT NOW.
7102268786	I actually don’t know what to rate this yet I really need a min to organise and articulate my thoughts on this one hmm - gotta sit on it and see where I end upmy initial thoughts:this is a story following two cambridge students venturing into hell to find their professor and bring him back. motivations are untrustworthy, because our protagonists are unreliable. EVERYTHING Alice does or says or thinks cannot be trusted in my opinion - she is one of the most biased protagonists I’ve ever read through. She is a product of her environment - the often toxic and misogynistic world of academia, and her thoughts and thinking process reflect that. It provides an interesting contrast to the actual narrative events occurring in the moment of this book. Her unreliability pervades all elements - the disjointed but alarmingly clear narrative, the time shifts, the way information is presented, and most predominantly, her thoughts and feelings towards Peter, who is with her in hell. He is her colleague, her fellow student, and the two have a very complex relationship, often driven by the inconsistencies that remain in Alice’s mind and her complete and utter lack of considering a wider premise. This is NOT A ROMANCE. It is BARELY A LOVE STORY. Rf kuang does not include enough physicality to sell me on their love. It gets CLOSE. but romance readers you will NOT LIKE THIS. Those expecting an epic love story YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS. I am not sure why this has been marketed as a love story - I see how that’s the easiest selling point but it’s not the most applicable to this story as a whole. Love as a concept is one of the main reasons people seek purpose - it drives a lot of discussions about life and meaning. I ultimately think this is what katabasis is trying to say - that love, not just for another but of what it means to LIVE with the ticking clock of time, IS the driving factor in life, and what separates us from hell. Measurable and finite time is how love can exist - without time, life ceases to have meaning. I won’t digress more on this as I think this is adequately explored in the text.So many pitching this as a love story is actually fitting? I saw another review that said character motivations for why they are in hell are vague and ultimately unsatisfying, and fail to drive the plot forward. This is true. I also think their motivations aren’t the point. This is a story about two miserable people trying to be more than they can be. Of course they’re going to be very deluded.Comparisons to Babel I don’t think are fair - the nuances of academia that Kuang is exploring are different in each. One thing about Kuang is she IS going to drag academia - even though you can tell she loves the pursuit of knowledge (but enough to justify the cost?? katabasis argues no) onto the best part of this book: HELLI LOVE HOW RF KUANG CRAFTS HER WORLDS. Her depiction of hell was endlessly interesting, engaging, vivid, scary - her hellscape could inspire movies and art and further explorations of what Hell means. Seeing Alice and Peter move throughout the courts of hell was THRILLING in and of itself. What would be next? How would we see shades suffering? What does suffering even mean? It’s brilliant. Her references are brilliant, she is brilliant, it is the shining beacon of this book. The magic system: god I had to THINK for the first time in a LONG TIME to grasp how this worked and I LOVED IT. It was so nice to think and consider and contemplate and comprehend what was being told to me I loved that 😭😭😭😭😭😭 In this world magick can be studied and wielded using chalk - it is so rooted in academia it’s crazy. I adored the endless musings on theorems and logic and paradoxes and math to make their magic work. I have to reiterate it was SO NICE TO THINK. I couldn’t race through, I alongside Alice or Peter considered what was proposed and if I believed it. A delight yet challenge to read.The plot: it takes a ridiculous turn in the last quarter and the pacing goes to shit and it goes a bit insane - I see how this is reflective of Alice as a character and her potential mania but as a reader it led to a quick unsatisfying ending due to the speed we travelled to get there. Overall:I actually don’t think I liked this very much. You may be thinking, why the 4 star rating? because this book made me sit and ponder and think and asked a lot more of me than other books I’ve read recently. that is something I highly appreciate in a book. It is NOT going to be for everyone. This book has a LOT of flaws but I adore the portrayal and exploration of hell and its magic system, so heavy points for that. Alice and Peter suck but are products of their world. And that world can suck too. Maybe I’ll add to this in a few days we’ll see. For now those are my thoughts! Thanks Harper voyager for the proof copy to review
7598670594	2.5/5The Beast being a metaphor for diarrhea…interesting
7880193965	Babel was garbage. Katabasis is both better and worse.I feel awful saying this about the works of RF Kuang, because it's genuinely great to see someone win critical acclaim and commercial success writing unabashedly ambitious, nerdy genre fiction. It's particularly great to see her break out of the boxes in which traditional publishing tends to put women, and writers of colour, and tackle themes of more quote-unquote general interest, like academic abuse.If only she could. You know. Write.TL;DR (because oh my God this is such a long review, I'm so sorry): Katabasis is a shallow, clunky story that is not even ten per cent as clever as it pretends to be, and with an insultingly lazy ending.This is not a super organised review, I'm afraid, because if I try I'll just get sucked into the minutiae of this stupid, stupid book. If you're one of the RF Kuang stans who accuses her detractors of anti-intellectualism... no. No, this book is not intellectual. RF Kuang's fiction is not intellectual. Stick around and I'll show you why I say that.But before I do that, let's provide a synopsis and talk about what I actually liked about the book. Because I did like some things. Well, three things. I liked three things. With caveats. We'll get there.Anyway, synopsis: Katabasis is about two PhD students in the Department of "Analytic Magick" at Cambridge, Alice Law and Peter Murdoch. Their brilliant, demanding, "difficult" advisor has died, taking with him their academic prospects, and they both decide to descend to Hell to bring him back. To do this, they have to put aside their rivalry and the paranoid competitiveness encouraged by the academe (and specifically their advisor) and work together as a team. And perhaps become something more dot dot dot.Okay, things I liked. Don't worry, the list is short.Good Thing one: Peter is a logician and Alice and Peter bring up paradoxes and mathematical logic quite a bit. This is not the thing I liked. You'll see why. But early-ish in their journey through Hell, Alice and Peter encounter eccentrics who baffle them - and are ultimately baffled BY them - using logical paradoxes and conundrums. The eccentrics are extremely reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. And Carroll was, himself, a logician of some repute. You can see that influence in his most famous works, in fact. So it is a nice little homage to give this book's Hell - described by Peter as "a campus" - the air of a Carroll book.Good Thing Two: Alice Law. The protagonist of Katabasis is a neurotic, paranoid, wildly competitive teacher's pet riddled with internalised misogyny. She is incapable of trusting anyone - unsurprisingly, as she repeatedly shows herself as being unworthy of trust. She is a serial betrayer and straightforwardly an awful person. She also has the charm and charisma of the stale bread she eats for sustenance. Oh, we're TOLD that she's smart, but the only evidence we're provided (in Peter's infodumpy internal monologue) of her amazing mind is one-hit-of-the-bong thought bubbles like 'Do pets know they're going to die?' What we are SHOWN, repeatedly, is a bitchy goblin who would knife you if she thought it would get her a half-grade improvement. And as a supporter of women's rights AND women's wrongs, I thoroughly approve. Let! Women! Suck! Of course it would be nice if her character were revealed to us gradually through words and deeds, rather than one wall of text at time, but baby steps, you know? After the blinking cipher of Robin Swift, the protagonist of Babel, it's nice to see a recognisable attempt at a coherent psychological construct. Well done, Rebecca.Of course this abject wretch of a character does need a little redeeming before we can invest in her romance and/or happy ending, which. Oh dear. We'll get there.Good Thing Three: RF Kuang is at her best when she's nerding out about a cool thing she found out about. The best bits of Babel, by a country mile, are the fun etymological tidbits scattered through the novel. The best bits of Katabasis, by far, are the fun bits of geometry, or logical paradoxes, she's found. Of course, there's a flipside, a huge one. We'll get there.Now, as to what I didn't like. Oh, brother. Where to start.Well, let's start with some specific issues with this book, before talking about some recurring themes with RF Kuang's work.Issue One: The Romance. Alice, as I have mentioned above, is highkey a monster. Which makes her an entertaining main character in lots of ways, but also makes it unbelievably jarring when her love story is initially framed as a cutesy, tropey, Ali-Hazelwood-esque rivals-to-lovers story of the klutzy girl pining on the bleachers for the hot boy whom everyone loves ESPECIALLY THAT BITCH BELINDA WHOM RF KUANG CALLS AN ENGLISH ROSE. TWICE. (By the way, Babel also had a white girl who was called an English rose in the narration and whom the protagonist despised. Rebecca, what white girl hurt you?) It's very creepy to read about the tee-hee whoops-that's-my-morning-wood-poking-you-in-the-leg-oh-noes aw-shucks romance between some golden retriever and the tightly wound, snarling pitbull who is the protagonist.Issue Two: The Resolution. And speaking of the protagonist... well, without spoilers, let's just say that she gets a series of wins that she has done absolutely bugger-all to deserve. Not through growth, not through development, not through visibly putting someone else above her own interests, nothing. She gets deus ex machina after deus ex machina, to the point that even she protests feebly at all this generosity. Well, I say 'she'. I mean that a beta or a developmental editor must have deferentially suggested to RF Kuang that people (in, I remind you, Hell) are being awfully nice to her horrible protagonist for literally no reason. And RF Kuang, instead of writing some growth for her protagonist, simply shrugged her shoulders and wrote 'Don't argue. Accept it.' Ostensibly as advice to the protagonist, but really as an instruction to the reader. Take what you're given, pleb. And it's OK. I don't need all my fiction to come tied up in a nice moralistic bow. But it's still very weird and narratively unsatisfying for all the issues in the book to be resolved, one after the other, because someone shows up and chucks the protagonist a lifeline at exactly the right time.Anyway, let's talk about common criticisms of RF Kuang's oeuvre in general. Criticism One: She tells, rather than shows. This is a classic criticism, and achingly true of Kuang's writing. We are TOLD Alice and Peter are smart. We are TOLD their fearsome advisor is smart. We are TOLD of their internal struggles (physical and mental). We are TOLD in one wall of text that one character has always been in love with the other, and are meant to accept that in lieu of anything we are shown about their dynamic. We are told these things in big descriptive paragraphs rather than being drip-fed a gradual accumulation of events that would allow us to come to a conclusion about these characters ourselves. I will say, however, that I do think RF Kuang is trying to show Alice Law's (quite heinous!) character as well as tell it to us. An attempt has been made. Not a successful one, but still.Criticism Two: RF Kuang condescends to her audience because she thinks she's smarter than they are. Ouf, this one's a doozy. Again, I actually think Katabasis is not as bad an offender as Babel, which insisted on telling you how to feel about every character, every event, and every historical personage mentioned in the book. Katabasis doesn't bother telling you that Lewis Carroll and Dante had problematic involvements with young women, or that TS Eliot was an anti-Semite, or the many many ways in which Western accounts of Eastern religious texts repeat the sins of Colonialism. She spares us much extraneous moralising. You know what that is? Growth.Now, there is still plenty of room for Katabasis to talk down to its audience. Every time RF Kuang introduces a mathematica or philosophical concept, for example, she has the temptation to lapse into the 'BUCKLE UP CHUCKLEFUCKS WE ARE GOING TO DO A LEARN TODAY' register of which she seems so terribly fond. She has the temptation...and she gives in. Every time. I'll provide some examples of this in a bit.Stans of RF Kuang typically respond to the latter accusation with 'Well, what do you expect? She's an academic.' Stans of RF Kuang typically follow up this defence with an implication that RF Kuang's detractors just don't like dense works with lots of citations. It's anti-intellectualism, they say, plain and simple. You just don't like an academic style.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk a little about that 'academic style'. In Katabasis, teeing up a meditation on how the lead couple's relationship changed for the worse one summer, RF Kuang introduces an academic work thusly: "That summer, the philosopher Derek Parfit published the very controversial Reasons and Persons...Reasons and Persons argues for a reductionist account of personal identity: that is to say, no special essence of personhood that remains stable across one's lifetime."This is not an 'academic style'. This is the 'style' of a high-schooler knocking back Red Bull as she hammers out a five paragraph essay. It is the 'style' of a Maid of Honour giving a wedding toast beginning with 'Webster's Dictionary defines 'love' as...'In any competent piece of writing - whether academic or not - a guiding principle is intention. Why is any element of this text there? What does it contribute to the whole?In an academic work, every citation needs to be in there for a reason. You're setting up the literature to show how you contribute. You are providing weight to an argument. You are, perhaps, showing an opposing view for the purposes of academic rigour. Bibliography-padding is resolutely frowned upon.What are RF Kuang's citations adding to her work?The most obvious candidate answer, of course, is plot. Don't we find out about all sorts of exciting paradoxes, mathematical and philosophical concepts? We do, we do, we do. We're told about Pascal's Wager, about Gabriel's Horn, about the Law of Noncontradiction and the Law of the Excluded Middle, about the Liar's Paradox and Zeno's Paradox. They're very cool.Now if only any of them mattered. Like, at all.I'll explain. Pascal's Wager is used to explain why PhD students fight for the vanishingly few academic jobs on offer instead of looking for lucrative industrial jobs, going on the market because what if, what if! The analogy that actually covers the situation Rebecca's describing is the common or garden lottery. But I accept that's not as sexy as Pascal's Wager. (Which is not really applicable for a situation best summed up as 'You Miss 100% of the Shots You Don't Take).Similarly, Gabriel's Horn is a geometric concept of a thing with infinite surface area but finite volume. Very cool. Except it's never actually used to resolve or open up anything. The Liar's Paradox is brought up to show how brilliant a character is for cracking it - only we never see how she does it. We DO see how the protagonist 'solves' Zeno's Paradox, and the solution is so stupid I actually cried.Okay, so not plot, you say. Character. If the characters know all this cool shit, they must be smart. This is how RF Kuang demonstrates that they're smart.Again, no. If these Big Brane references only exist at the margins of the story - if they don't MATTER - then we cannot infer anything about the characters from how they use (or misuse) them. And let's be clear, Katabasis misapplies concepts at least as often as it uses them correctly.Well, you say. Maybe RF Kuang wants her readers to go away and do their own research on these cool things she's introducing.Does she? Does she really? RF Kuang gives you a Cliff's-Notes summary of the concept and salient details - right there in the text. In the case of Babel, she not only gives you that summary but also a potted biography of the relevant characters and a bullet-point list of Why That Person Was Problematic. RF Kuang is not whetting your appetite to learn more. She is, in fact, doing everything she can to PREVENT you from wandering away to do your own research. Everything you could want to know is right here! Don't you DARE form your own thoughts or opinions! What do you mean you want to order in thoughts? We've got thoughts at home!In fact, one might argue that - so far from encouraging you to do your own research - RF Kuang wants to make sure you stay right with her, because if you DID your own research, you might find that she's misapplied nearly every single one of the Very Cool Concepts she's dazzled you with.So that leaves one explanation. RF Kuang snows you with intellectual brand names as a form of bibliography-padding. She's trying to dazzle you with the borrowed credibility of Eliot, of Godel, of Wittgenstein, of Euclid, of Russell, etc etc etc. And it clearly works for many! RF Kuang gives you the feeling of being learned without the need to do any actual learning. It's a good wheeze, if you don't think about it.I understand that quite a few people who loved RF Kuang's earlier work are not sold on Katabasis. People who love the book are bewildered. Quite rightly - if you loved Babel, then presumably you were bought in to the RF Kuang Method? Some of RF Kuang's worst habits (as I mention above) are actually dialled DOWN in katabasis compared to Babel. So what gives?I think there's a couple of things going on here. One is that RF Kuang's been gaining more mainstream fame, so she's gaining more and more new readers. Readers who come to Kuang outside of BookTok, who come to Kuang without having been exposed to her style. With a wider audience comes more scrutiny and more criticism. That's just how it is.For the people who loved Babel and hated Katabasis? I suggest that you go back and re-read Babel. You may find that your taste has changed over the years.
6066300805	Happy Katabaseees Day!! 🎉(Yes that's how I’ll be pronouncing that word)Katabasis, noun, Ancient Greek. The story of a hero's descent to the underworld.This has probably been the hardest book for me to review because it was just IMMACULATE. I cannot find the right words to describe how intelligent, sharp and it is THE book that distinctly has the writing style that can only belong to R.F. Kuang.I really enjoyed the dark academia elements. It truly captured the full spectrum of the academia experience. The insatiable pursuit of knowledge. A relentless drive for truth that always seems just out of reach. A craving for recognition. The desire for validation and achievement. But most of all the connection and admiration with someone who shares that same goal and ambition.In the months leading up to the release, I’ve seen a lot of reading materials out there to “prepare oneself” before reading Katabasis. It would have been nice if I had the time to get through that list, but life happens and I never got around to that list. After finishing Katabasis, I didn’t think it was necessary as I found everything referenced was easily understandable and the ones that didn’t immediately stand out to me were very cleverly explained by R.F. Kuang herself in the book. Although I think this is one of those reads where it gets even better the second time around, to catch all the references cause I definitely missed a few for sure.Alice and Peter were such complex characters. Throughout their journey to Hell, we learn so much more about their inner struggles, the inferiority complex, that drive for knowledge. As well how much they are more alike peer to peer, rivals to rivals and even as individuals. And in true R.F. Kuang fashion, there’s always a character who we don’t always like or agree with, their actions and justifications of motives are hard to agree with. But that's the whole beauty in it, while we may not agree with it, we can come to understand it to some degree. I genuinely had fun with this book. There was a lot to unpack, to think about, to process, to analyse and to argue about. I love when books leave me with this feeling.Thank you @harpervoyagerus for the arc!
8052514117	– 𝙧𝙚𝙫𝙞𝙚𝙬 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙨 𝙨𝙥𝙤𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧𝙨 ⸝⸝.ᐟ⋆𝘒𝘢𝘵𝘢𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘴 is a smart, engaging book that leans hard into its own intelligence, in a good way. I saw a lot of people describe it as "Info dump: the novel" which i really don't agree with. It's dark academia, it's supposed to be "smart", if that's not your cup of tea or if you don't like the way RF Kuang utilizes it, then just move on.The non-linear storytelling really worked for me. It’s one of those narratives where you’re piecing things together as you go, and it really kept me on the edge of my seat guessing and theorizing.The world-building and concept of the stages were intriguing, but sometimes unclear. Are the transcripts used for everyone? Does everyone go through every stage? If so, why? Did even the people in Pride commit sins as bad as Tyranny? Does everyone start in Pride then? The book didn't make that clear enough for me.Kuang's prose is polished as always, I just feel that the cursing occasionally felt out of place tonally, like it didn’t quite match the moment or the character voice.Pacing-wise, it’s mostly interesting, mysterious, and consistently engaging. My only real issue was the ending. The last stages of Hell felt rushed compared to the thoughtful build-up earlier on. We barely get to spend any time in the really bad sins, like Violence and Cruelty, even though they were teased so interestingly in the beginning and described as maybe even unsurvivable. If that's the case, then show me, don't just tell me how bad it is supposed to be!𝐀𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞 is often described as unlikeable, but honestly? I didn’t find her that way at all. She’s a faceted, messy, deeply human character, and a lot of her struggles (academia, self-worth, pressure, being a little idiot sometimes) felt painfully relatable. And the whole "she only did it for a recommendation letter" take? No. The book makes it pretty clear she has much stronger motivations (first we assume it's because she felt bad for killing Grimes, then it becomes clear it's because she wants to make him suffer .)Speaking of, I was a bit annoyed when we had already resolved that Alice hates Grimes and wants to make him suffer, only to get lulled back into believing that maybe she's falling back into her "groomed/abused student" mentality? I realize victims can react that way, but I felt it was just a cheap way to try and get a reaction or "what if?" shock-moment out of the reader.𝐏𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫 was really enjoyable as a character. I liked him and his and Alice's relationship. HOWEVER, that one disrespectful, misogynistic gesture he makes (that Alice HEARD him make and that REALLY hurt her) remained strangely unresolved. I kept expecting it to be brought up again, but it never does and it just... hangs in the air. It kind of feels like Kuang forgot about it and only put it in there to keep the air of "enemies-to-lovers" about it, but it turns out it was all just a miscommunication and that they never truly hated each other? So the gesture feels even weirder and more out of place?I feel like the novel would've needed another round of editing, regarding this, the out of place cursing and the world-building.Overall, 𝘒𝘢𝘵𝘢𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘴 is clever, atmospheric, and full of sharp observations about academia and identity. Even with a few loose threads, I found it a hooking and fun read.
7395167479	This is one of my most anticipated books of 2025. Whilst it didn’t get a five star, it didn’t disappoint me. I got what I expected from early reviews. It only makes sense to go into Hell with your academic rival to rescue your former thesis supervisor who is both their hero and a slimy scumbag. I disagree with the reviews that say the characters lacked depth or motivation. Alice is someone who is driven by academia. Her purpose, her worth, her self is built around academia, and thus the opinion of her supervisor. Alice will make you mad even as you sympathise for her. The internalised misogyny that inserted itself into her internal monologue made me grit my teeth. If someone didn’t know this was biting satire and wasn’t aware of Rf Kuang as an author, I wonder what they make take from it. Alice is unstable and spiralling and you will feel that. Peter, on the other hand, felt more surface level. Up until the half way point, he is the cardboard cutout of the charismatic, clever, perfect genius. Even when we got more of his backstory, it felt tacked on to give him depth and reasons for us to understand Alice’s later actions and emotions. The boner scene was weird though. “There's a million things to keep a soul from writing, all in the service of making you better at it.”I do agree with reviews that say Hell was a let down. It wasn’t scary or atmospheric and it all felt the same despite progressing through the rings. The descriptions felt flimsy especially considering that each ring should represent a sin. This is dark in the sense that you witness the unravelling of the self. There is a huge emphasis on toxic power dynamics and hero complexes. It was all so unfair, she thought. You thought people were giants, and they devastated you by being so human.Hell itself is not that dark. The villains almost felt over the top and the climax was a bit of a let down. However, I went into this knowing this wasn’t about the plot. The plot is the one sentence blurb. This is about the characters’ inner journeys and realisations. Specifically, Alice. Will you be confused? Is this pretentious? Do you need to read the stacks of texts people are shoving in your face prior to this? No. I did read Dante’s Inferno in university, but, unlike Alice, I don’t have an incredible memory, so I went in with vague recollections of absurdist humour. There are references to it of course, as well as other scholarly texts, but do you study astrophysics to read Sci Fi? Do a deep dive into Tolkien to understand the inspiration of many modern fantasy authors?I felt most lost with the logic and math that is used to ‘explain’ the magic system. I would read it with glazed eyes and try to muddle it out. Sometimes I understood the fallacies and (un)rationale, most I just accepted that I was not a try-hard graduate Oxbridge student in a fantasy world trying to travel through Hell.How to set your expectations? Take the biting modern satire of Yellowface, the determination of Rin from The Poppy War, and the critiques from Babel. Then add in Hell and a crippling need for academic validation. (Also, did anyone else have a spelling mistake at around the 59% mark or was that just my copy? ‘here’ instead of her?)Bookstagram Tiktok
6084212775	If Babel is Kuang's love letter to academia, Katabasis is the complete opposite.You’ll know from the blurb that this book is about two PhD students venturing to Hell to save their advisor’s soul. That happens in the very first chapter and with that action-seeped hook firmly lodged in the reader’s brain, the narrative unspools into a litany of valid critiques about higher education: unsupportive thesis supervisors; professors who plagiarize their students’ work; non-consensual affairs between teacher and student; overworked, underpaid and uncredited research assistants; nervous breakdowns from lack of support and such. And since this novel is set during a time when women were just starting to be allowed to study at university, there’s a healthy dose of sexism too, like how Alice is constantly forced to prove that she’s more than her body.I wasn’t prepared for how nihilist this story got. The question Humanities scholars always get asked is, “What’s the point of you your research?” Kuang really digs deep into this question and expands it to the age-old question of what’s the meaning of life itself. This is, of course, perfectly layered against Alice and Peter’s journey through the different circles of Hell (lust, pride, wrath, etc), where they see sinners creatively punished and trying to earn reincarnation.Katabasis is on the erudite side (unsurprisingly) with its philosophical discussions and name-dropping, but is still very accessible to mainstream audiences.This is the first of Kuang’s works that hasn’t spotlighted racism and colonialism as themes, but it’s no less impactful.
7155214383	I'm struggling to compose my thoughts on this one. As someone who loves dark academia, and RFK's previous novels, I felt like I knew what I was getting into when I picked this up.To start with my favorite parts : I thought the love story was rich, believable, and never heavy-handed or cheesy. The actual descent into hell (and most of the first few hundred pages) were genuinely un-put-downable. Engaging, with lovely prose. I think she took a great premise, and executed it well. I was invested, start to finish!Truthfully, my only "problem" while reading is that the pacing stutters. It flickers on and off, from around the 50% mark, on. I switched to audio in order to get through the parts which were a lot slower/denser and thought that, by the end, this was no longer an issue. But I also think that this maybe wouldn't have been a problem at all if some of the book were edited down. When I've seen people mention this in earlier reviews, the response seems to be, "don't pick up dark academia books if you're going to complain about them being academic" (i.e: dense). Well I love the genre, and I do still think this was a tad overwritten. But, you know, I can see that this comes from a place of love! You can definitely feel how excited RFK was, while writing Katabasis. It's why I still, ultimately, found it to be a d*mn good book. I'll reread it, I'll recommend it, I'll hold it in high regard.And the ending kicked a-- !

7371346304	On the surface, Katabasis could have been Kuang’s magnum opus. Through The Poppy War, through Babel, and even through the mildly terrible Yellowface, the one thing she has held incredibly consistently is her ability to make a reader feel gut-churning disgust. In this book, that is actually utilised to great effect—it is, after all, a journey through hell, and the horror of it is quite well done. Unfortunately, that horror is never leveraged, because the journey through hell is nothing but set-dressing to the broader point. What is the broader point? I am damned (pun maybe intended) if I know.Katabasis is not Kuang’s magnum opus because it is nothing. It is four hundred pages of the most nothing that I have ever read, and the worst part is that it is incredibly disappointing. Much like Babel, the magic system in this book is erudite in a fascinating way, based around logic, maths and a little philosophy. To that end, this book is steeped in theory and, as another reviewer has said, there will be people saying they weren’t smart enough to understand it. To lay that to rest, I love philosophy, I love literature. I don’t love maths. But my point is that I understood most of the references made in the book, even the ones that the narrative did not explain line by line, and while I appreciated how interwoven the plot was with the literary canon it is paying homage to, it didn’t matter, because those references were in service of absolutely nothing. The book didn’t have anything to say. The philosophy, the plot, even the characters, existed just for the sake of it. The one message I could pick out of the book, the one thing that it seemed to care about in any form, was that academia… has misogyny? And the sky is blue.This is something I’ve found to be a persistent frustration with Kuang’s work. Her books frequently function as mouthpieces for a message, and often that message is incredibly simplistic. However, there is usually something else to make up for it. Babel is baby’s first guide to post-colonialism, but it is a tight, moving story and I do think any discerning reader would look further than upmarket fiction if they truly want to understand colonial theory or history. Yellowface, for all its (many, many) flaws, was a page-turner. The premise of a white author stealing her dead Asian colleague’s work and doing yellowface to pass it off as her own, accompanied by Kuang’s aforementioned talent for inciting revulsion in a reader—in this case revulsion for the anti-hero protagonist—sustained the book. It was, if nothing else, entertaining. Katabasis is not. Alice is an archetype of the Asian woman dying for academic approval. Peter is the golden boy who floats through life unencumbered by empathy for those who exist below him—but wait! He has a secret that makes him deserving of sympathy! They both have various personal reasons for being obsessed with the form of validation that academia gives them, that heady sense of accomplishment that manifests in feeling better than everyone else for knowing x obscure philosopher’s obscure ideas. So what? What are you saying that doesn’t make my eyes roll back in my head for how obvious it is? The book feels masturbatory, and worse, it is boring. I couldn’t wait to be done with it.Katabasis is four hundred pages that are entirely allergic to anything of substance. The philosophy, the theory, the literature references; all this cleverness leads to nothing. There is no character, no truly driving plot, not even a general theme to grasp onto. The book comes and goes like smoke in the wind. Kuang is an accomplished academic, as her promotion constantly makes clear, and she has always been a slightly incurious writer for her heavy focus on research and theory, but never has this division been so clear. This book feels like four hundred pages of the author hunting for that academic validation—yes you do know x obscure philosopher’s obscure ideas. That doesn’t translate to this book being anything more meaningful than ink on paper.Advanced copy received in exchange for review.

7434518402	This is my favourite book I've read by RFK. But that's not saying much since I loathed her previous two. I guess it could be boring to some people, in the way people don't like Invisible Life of Addie LaRue while it is one of my favorite books of all time. I still think she's way too interested in making the reader understand how intellectual she is, how much reading she has done in life and how well researched her books are, and that's a major turn off for me because it serves no purpose generally. Generally. Here I feel it was overdone, but it was necessary for the story, so I could get over it. The characters are not my favorites, but I don't need to like the characters to like the book so that was fine, however Katabasis could benefit from better main characters that's for sure. The beginning was really strong, it lost me for a good while but then the plot picked up speed and it kept me gripped until the end. Overall it was an okay book.
