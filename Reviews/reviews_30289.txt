6763498	Let me explain why I'd recommend this book to everyone: Plato is stupid. Seriously.And it's important that you all understand that Western society is based on the fallacy-ridden ramblings of an idiot. Read this, understand that he is not joking, and understand that Plato is well and truly fucked in the head.Every single one of his works goes like this:SOCRATES: "Hello, I will now prove this theory!"STRAWMAN: "Surely you are wrong!"SOCRATES: "Nonsense. Listen, Strawman: can we agree to the following wildly presumptive statement that is at the core of my argument?" {Insert wildly presumptive statement here— this time, it's "There is such a thing as Perfect Justice" and "There is such a thing as Perfect Beauty", among others.}STRAWMAN: "Yes, of course, that is obvious."SOCRATES: "Good! Now that we have conveniently skipped over all of the logically-necessary debate, because my off-the-wall crazy ideas surely wouldn't stand up to any real scrutiny, let me tell you an intolerably long hypothetical story."{Insert intolerably long hypothetical story.}STRAWMAN: "My God, Socrates! You have completely won me over! That is brilliant! Your woefully simplistic theories should become the basis for future Western civilization! That would be great!"SOCRATES: "Ha ha! My simple rhetorical device has duped them all! I will now go celebrate by drinking hemlock and scoring a cameo in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!"The moral of the story is: Plato is stupid.
182885147	Plato's "The Republic", is a great but flawed masterpiece of western literature, yes it makes sense, mostly, some of it. "I am the wisest man in the world because I know one thing, that I know nothing", said the smart man ... Socrates. Plato is writing for Socrates, his friend and teacher. Late teacher, since being forced to commit suicide by the uncomfortable citizens of Athens ( the famous poisoned cup of hemlock), for corrupting the minds of youth. Socrates didn't believe books were as effective as lectures, big mistake. Socrates advocates complete state control of everything, land, schools , businesses, homes, and even children to be taken away from their parents and raised by the state. In other words, an early form of communism. Plato agreed but Aristotle didn't , he knew only parents would love their children , which kids need. Most of the book is dialogues between various men as how to establish a perfect state. Socrates / Plato wanted Greece ruled by philosopher kings. With a professional army to back them up. An unreachable goal, as 24 centuries later, has shown. Greed is the primary motivation of the human race, but people keep on trying to reach the elusive "Utopia", and failing forever? Socrates the wise man, was correct.
153076970	My re-reading of this for my university course has led me to the same conclusions I found when I first read it a couple of years back, except this time I am fortunate enough to have understood it better than last time. My conclusions being that Plato, and through him Socrates, was very intelligent, believed he was more intelligent than everyone else (no matter how many times he declared himself unwise) and very much loved to talk. Socrates, in particular, must have been very fond of the sound of his own voice.You can't give a book that revolutionised philosophy any less than 3 stars, even if about 70% of it features many generalisations, jumping to bizarre conclusions, and claims without good reason. And yes, Plato and Socrates had some brilliant ideas - all the more brilliant because they came up with them first - but they don't measure up to today's version of "rational thinking". Good, but outdated. I suppose the best thing about their ideas was that they laid the foundations for the next 2000 years of Western philosophy and politics. Gender Equality?And, though hardly feminists, Socrates and Plato were some of the first to publicly suggest that education should be equal to both genders (apart from military training) and that women should have as large a political role as men, seeing as they make up half of society. Go early Greek gender equality!! Though I suppose the line "whining and crying as if they were but women" (or something to that effect) kind of pisses on that feminist bonfire. Oh well...Justice?So here's some of the reasons why The Republic fails. Firstly, Socrates (the character) assumes that because one example demonstrates a certain type of relationship, then this idea can be applied to all. When he is arguing with Thrasymachus about justice, Thrasymachus says that justice is whatever the rulers decide it to be and that they use this power for their own good and the weaker (i.e. the subjects) get screwed over. Socrates then uses the example of a physician who is stronger than his patients but his agenda is only to help them. Well:1) Even if a physician selflessly helps his patients, this does not prove that rulers have the best interests of their citizens in mind. There is not a naturally occurring relationship between the two.2) As Thrasymachus goes on to point out, the physician is doing it for his own benefit because he is paid to do the job.Stupidity & ContradictionsSo then Socrates starts with the bullshit that doesn't get refuted because the author is on his side, of course. He says that the physician is divided into two roles: that of physician and that of moneymaker (yep). So, basically the two are separate and have nothing to do with each other... um, I beg to differ. You see? Some of the arguments are ridiculous. He also goes on to contradict himself later by stating that rulers do get a reward for ruling: money! If he had maintained his previous argument, then they should have done it anyway for the simple benefit of their subjects and moneymaking should be a separate thing entirely.Agent vs. Act VirtuePlato and Socrates talked a great deal about justice being an agent virtue and not just an act virtue. They believed that it wasn't good enough to act justly, you had to have a good soul as well. Makes sense until you get to where you judge people based on them having a good soul or not - and just how do you do that?Person A: do you have a just soul?Person B: oh yes.Person A: Phew, let's be friends.????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????And they have a very warped view of what makes a person good/just. "A just man values wisdom above all else"... does he? I imagine a person who likes to make friends with the super-smart individuals and disregard the rest to be a bit of an ass. Don't you?
644304211	I’ve gotten into the habit of dividing up the books I’ve read by whether I read them before or after Plato’s Republic. Before The Republic, reading was a disorganized activity—much the same as wading through a sea of jumbled thoughts and opinions. I had no basis from which to select books, except by how much they appealed to my naïve tastes. But after reading The Republic, it was as if the entire intellectual landscape was put into perspective. Reading became a focused activity, meant to engage with certain questions.“Question” is the key word here because, in the end, that’s what Plato is all about: asking the right questions, the important questions. All academic disciplines are organized around a few basic questions—“what is the nature of human cognition?” “what are the fundamental laws of the universe?”—and in The Republic, Plato touches on almost every one of them. That’s why shelving the book in the philosophy section doesn’t quite do it justice. An exhaustive list of the disciplines touched upon in this dialogue would be massive—epistemology, metaphysics, psychology, eschatology, political science, economics, art, literature, music. In fact, it would be easier naming disciplines that aren’t touched upon.That’s how Plato lit up the intellectual landscape for me. By posing these questions in their most basic forms, and attempting answers, he makes it clear which questions are the important ones in life, and how difficult they are to answer. And that’s why Plato’s Republic is the quintessential classic. It has everything a classic should have—a unique perspective, brilliant ideas, engagement with perennial issues, and a charming writing style. It is the greatest book of perhaps the Western tradition’s greatest thinker. I don’t care who you are—you should read it.Nevertheless, there are some perplexing and frustrating things about Plato. For one, it is extraordinarily difficult to figure out where Plato stands in relation to his work. Unlike almost every later philosopher, Plato didn’t write didactic works. He puts his ideas—sometimes conflicting ideas—into the mouths of the people of his day. The result is a kind of double confusion. To what extent are the ideas expressed by Socrates actually Socrates’s? To what extent are they Plato’s? To what extent are they anyone’s? Perhaps Plato was just fond of playing intellectual games and creating philosophical pocket dramas.Added to this is a kind of subtle irony that creeps up in several of his dialogues. In Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates complain about the evils of writing; yet Plato obviously loved to write. One of Plato’s most influential ideas is his theory of forms; yet one of the most influential arguments against the theory was put forward by Plato himself. In The Republic, as well as elsewhere, Plato repeatedly equates knowledge with goodness, and falsity with evil; yet he proposes to found his entire utopia on a massive lie. And again, in this book Plato puts forward one of the most famous arguments in history against poetry and the arts; yet Plato was one of the most artistic of all writers. Plato proposes to banish the myths of Homer and Hesiod; then Plato ends his magnum opus with his own myth. You see these contradictions again and again, which leads you to wonder: how many of his arguments are meant to be taken seriously?What’s more, some of the arguments put forward in his dialogues are—it must be said—frustratingly stupid, relying on false analogies and several other types of fallacies. This would be no mystery if he was a halfwit. But the quality of his writing and the originality of his ideas make it clear that he was a genius. This again makes you wonder if he is putting forth his ideas in earnest.There are many complaints commonly lodged at Plato (and his pupil Aristotle). Liberals criticize his hatred of democracy and freedom. Moralists complain that he embraced slavery. (A friend of mine once told me that his philosophy professor called Aristotle the “father of racism.”) Scientists—such as Carl Sagan—disparage Plato’s anti-empirical and mystical tendencies. Nietzsche and his followers condemn Plato for dividing up the world into self-evident good and bad. The list of complaints can be extended almost endlessly. And, it should be said, there is some justice in all of these criticisms. (But just you try and found an entire intellectual tradition spanning thousands of years, and see if you do any better!)In Plato, I find something so valuable that it could outweigh every one of those criticisms: Plato's celebration of thinking for its own sake—argument for the sake of argument, debate for the sake of debate. Too often, we consider intellectual activity as merely a means to some desirable end; how rarely we consider that thinking is its own reward. Vigorous thought is one the keenest joys in life. And that is why Plato is so valuable, why he still has so much to offer our world—perhaps now more than ever.[A note on justice. Even though Plato spills much ink in trying to prove that justice is more desirable than injustice, I think the real solution is in Glaucon’s speech in Book 2, where Plato manages to hit upon the solution provided by game theory. It’s worth quoting at length.[Many have believed] that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. [I.e. The evil suffered from injustice is greater than the good gained from acting unjustly.] And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but the lesser evil, and honored by reason of the inability of the men to do injustice.This view—purportedly the common view of justice—is game theory in a nutshell. Cheating your neighbor is (for you) the biggest positive, since you get their resources without having to work. But being cheated is the biggest negative, since you lose both your resources and the work you invested in procuring them. Creating laws to abolish cheating is a sort of compromise—avoiding the pain of being cheated at the expense of the gain from cheating. That, to me, seems like the most logical explanation of justice.This is just one example of why it's rewarding to read Plato, because even when he's wrong, he's right.]
214717253	Is the attempt to determine the way of man’s life so small a matter in your eyes—to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage? (1.344d)I propose therefore that we inquire into the nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them. (2.368e—369a) The Republic: An Apology “The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.” ~ Alfred North WhiteheadThe Famous Republic'The Republic' is either reverenced, reviled or just plain ignored. Though it keeps resurfacing, it has been pushed back often, being accused of bigotry, racism, elitism, casteism, anti-democratic nature, the list is endless. But it is beyond doubt, one of the preeminent philosophical works and has been quoted, referenced or adapted by almost all of the major thinkers since. The ideas of Socrates have had an afterlife that is as long and varied as the thousand year journey envisioned for souls in the famous Story of Er. It is impossible to catalogue the full list of impacts but Whitehead's quote (introductory to this review) gives adequate flavor. The practical influence of Republic is more difficult to gauge than its impact on the theorizing of later thinkers - over the centuries, individuals have discovered in Plato’s works the inspiration for undertaking political or social or educational reform and have used it as the springboard for much revolutionary thought, and deeds.Republic has inspired in addition to all the expository analysis, also countless creative interpretations, which have shaped our vision of future possibilities, limits and of extremities. Many depictions of both utopian societies and their dystopian counterparts, ranging from Thomas More’s Utopia to Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver's Travels to Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World to George Orwell’s 1984, have their roots in the ideal city brought to life by Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Contemporary films such as Gattaca and The Matrix may not owe direct inspiration to Republic, but they participate in a long tradition of artistic works that ultimately trace their concerns back to the political, social, and metaphysical issues raised in Republic.But in spite of all this, the original work retains a reputation for being difficult and hard to penetrate. This has meant that the scholars have more or less appropriated this brilliantly composed treatise, and that is a pity. There is great suspense in every page as you eagerly try to work your way through Socrates’ arguments… anticipating now, guessing now, failing now, but always on the edge of your seats at the sparkle of his wit and wisdom. The dialogues are constructed with an almost unbelievable care and subtlety. The drama is breathtaking and all-pervading, even in the stock responses to theoretical or rhetorical questions. One is never allowed to sit and absorb passively, but is forced to constantly interact with the dialogue. It is as much fun to read as a Shakespearean drama.The Offensive RepublicNow, to examine some of the reasons why The Republic offends modern sensibilities:Much of the contemporary discomfort with Plato’s state arises from his countenancing of censorship, a rigid caste system, etc. But these are in a way unfortunate misunderstandings. A close reading of the text would make clear that these catch-all descriptions of Plato’s state are not as representative as they are made out to be. For example, the caste system that is first to get blamed is hardly a rigid hereditary system, but a strict meritocratic system that is much more equal than anything that we have seen till date. It involves a strict battery of tests (similar to the aptitude tests of today) based on which every individual is to be judged (and opponents of IQ tests may relax - these are meant to be much more practical examinations).Also, the popular rendering of the title as “The Republic” itself is unfortunate, giving it an obvious political and ideological overtone. In the manuscripts and ancient citations, the title of Republic is given as Politeia (“Constitution”) or Politeiai (“Constitutions”); Peri dikaiou (literally, “concerning that which is just”) is sometimes listed as an alternative title.The Misunderstood RepublicI had planned on giving a blow by blow defense of the most reviled aspects of The Republic, but that is not the point I wish to make here. The primary mistake in criticizing The Republic is to assume that it was meant to be a political treatise in the first place. It is not. The whole argument begins from a question of identifying what ‘Justice’ is and whether it is beneficial to live a ‘Just Life’. This is the crux. ‘Why’ and ‘How’ to be Just and ‘What’ is this “Justice’ anyway? That is what Socrates wants to explore. He takes detours in this exploration. He uses metaphors - of State (as larger manifestation), of Caves, etc. But they all lead us back to the same basic question.To identify this basic concern, we need only look at the complex structure of the dialogue itself. Republic’s “narrative” is structured in an almost circular pattern. This circular pattern is complex, evoking the narrative patterns of epic poems such as Iliad and Odyssey. Most basically, the dialogue’s two main concerns (defining justice and ascertaining its relationship to happiness) are treated in two corresponding sections (books 2-4 and books 8-9) that are interrupted by what is nominally a series of digressions in books 5-7, and 10. These nominal digressions, of course, create the dialogue’s most memorable metaphors, but they are meant to be digressions that add to the core. Not the other way around.At its most basic level, Republic is an effort to forge a consistent and meaningful redefinition of “Justice”. The aretê that is explored lies in nothing outward, but rests solely in the mature reason and regard for what is beneficial to the soul. Not all the details in these allegories stand up to logical analysis, but they are not meant to. This is made clear by the fact that The Republic’s interlocutors repeatedly draw attention to the incomplete, provisional, and at times unsatisfactory nature of their treatment of justice, happiness, the ideal political community, the theory of the ideas, the cognitive faculties of human beings, etc. The inadequacy of “the method we are employing” is acknowledged at 4.435c-d, at 6.504b-d and in many other places.The Personal Constitution: A Constitution of the Perfect LifeThe Perfect State sketched out (which is the stub of almost all criticism) is only an approximation devised to arrive at the Perfect Man, and that is why the so called bad aspects can be deemed acceptable. The mistake, as stated already, is to see it as a purely political treatise while it is in fact a treatise on justice and how to live the perfect life - the ‘Constitution’ of a perfect life. "He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or from want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means." In the end, the state is not fleshed out enough to really form a complete constitution for any state that can exist in reality (and not just as an idea). But the psychological part (it is curious how this part has generated so much less criticism, in comparison) is - we return in the end (and all the way in between) to the original question of how an individual should order his life - what his virtues should be. It is a political critique piggy-backing on a personal enquiry and hence any commentary of it cannot treat them differently. Censorship, slaves, aristocracy are all wonderful aspects in an individual but not palatable in a state (to modern eyes). Hence, we can only criticize that the greater to smaller equality is not well realized (i.e. from state => individual). But then Socrates, as above, is always eager to make the point about the provisional nature of his metaphor which is only meant to incite thinking and not as an answer - that is just not the way to deal with true lovers of truth, with true philosophers.[Cheeky counterproposal by the reviewer's alter-ego: “Or all the personal stuff is just a convenient cloak for the political criticism that is the real purpose! After all, we cannot forget the historical milieu in which Plato composed it. He had enough axes to grind!”]Indeed, the more we approach certain aspects of the text from analytic and conceptual standpoints, the more we find that Socrates and his companions make innumerable assumptions and leaps of logic that is not satisfactory or fully justified. Each of these can be fairly scrutinized and contested, and have been. We may raise any number of questions about its relevance to our experiences and value systems. Much of Republic, especially its political philosophy, argument for Censorship and Social structuring, is at odds with modern ideals; some readers will doubtless be dissatisfied with, among other things, its unapologetic elitism and naive (almost laughable) confidence in the integrity of “philosopher-rulers.” Some, however, may find that its critique of ancient Athenian society opens the door to meaningful questions about contemporary cultural practices and priorities. And even more meaningful questions on how to organize our inner impulses and constitution.Philosopher, Be ThyselfWe need to understand that the Platonic Dialogues, in principle, are not meant to represent a simple doctrine that can be followed, they instead are meant to prepare the way for philosophizing. They are not easy guide books to follow. They require work from the reader, above and beyond the ideas presented. That is one of the reasons for the dialogue nature in which they are structured. Plato’s overarching purpose in writing the Republic was to effect a change in his readers similar to the change that Glaucon and Adeimantus undergo at Socrates’ hands in the fictional world of the dialogue. This purpose can be summed up in the word protreptic, from the Greek protrepein, which means “turn (someone) forward,” hence “propel,” “urge on,” “exhort.” Plato uses literary art, which in his case includes but is not limited to philosophical argument, to move his reader toward a greater readiness to adopt a just way of life.The dialogues are thus intended to perform the function of a living teacher who makes his students think. One must philosophize to understand them. One must look at the microcosm of the dialogues as well as the macrocosm of the world that we inhabit simultaneously to understand them. It is in this process that the dialogues assist, insist and themselves provide a training in.We can only conclude by asking questions, in the true spirit of the dialectic method: Can we then say that we are convinced, that justice, as defined by Socrates, is something intrinsically valuable? Are we convinced that the just man can be “happy” even if he does not enjoy a reputation for justice, nor any other material benefit, in this life or after? OR Have Socrates and his companions persuaded us that the ideal city-state they describe in Republic is truly the best political community possible? Do we believe that Socrates himself thinks so? Is that what we take away from such a deep examination of how to live our lives? Or do we let the Story of Er guide us back to the truer motives of the interlocutors? "I really do not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go."
3195809943	“Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.”― Plato, The RepublicA book, that I suppose we all have to read, and in my personal experience should want to read. I read this as a task completing exercise, in that I need to get this read at some stage of other in my life. It also feels like the sort of book that needs to be studied to get the most of, or at least with some personal desire to understand.Can this really be the foundations of Western philosophy within the pages of a medium sized book? Looking at some of the negative criticisms of this book, I would counter that this read was as much about the art of debate, questioning the status quo and exploring ideas to reach positive goals for me; also it is obviously needs to be taken into the context of the age that it was written in, which in itself makes this a remarkable piece of work, surely? 6 out of 12 for this truly classical read.2008 read
156502848	Halfway through now and the ability to see the book as a metaphor for civic and personal moral development becomes difficult. The book is only useful if you are tracking the history of ideas, which I am not. The state Plato describes here is one that is highly prohibitive in almost every aspect. Arts and culture are severely controlled for propaganda purposes. There is a complete inability to view open, transparent government as an option. The guardians must be lied to and deceived constantly if they are to develop correctly. Moreover, to establish what we might call a footing for his premises, there is an overwhelming amount of presumption on the part of the author. Much of the reasoning seems specious. It strikes this reader how Plato did not have a long and detailed historical record to call on as we do. There are many assumptions, for instance, with respect to the education of the guardians, that shows a weak grasp of human psychology. The guardians should, in effect, be shielded from badness and wrongdoing if they are to develop the appropriate appreciation for virtue. Well, if they're not exposed to badness, how will they know it when they see it? Other aspects of guardian nurturing and education, too, are severe if not totalitarian by today's standards. First, the very sick are to be left to die. This was of course a sign of the times. Medicine was primitive. But there is not an iota of compassion about those left to die. This, indeed, would connote "softness," something not wanted in our guardians, who are to be simultaneously brave and happy, not unlike the family dog. Plato actually says that. The overwhelming import of the reading so far has been to show me how very far we as a culture (western) have come in the more than 2,400 years since Republic's composition. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, and I paraphrase, the arc of history is long but it bends toward justice. I stopped on p. 134, unable to finish. To use a line from Candide, "the book fell from my hands."(AC says I should not be reading this translation at all but G.M.A. Grube's. So I will.).

2835726547	I’ve read this right through a couple of times now – three, or there about, I think. And bits of it many, many times. This is one of the key books of ‘the western canon’, you really do need to be aware of it. And you might be surprised at how frequently it is referenced, particularly in science fiction – everything from The Giver to Brave New World to The Matrix. And while the world Plato is presenting is meant to be a utopia, it is generally used as the basis for the most terrifying of dystopias. One of the things I noticed this time through was all the eugenics. Not just in the selective breeding of the human stock, but also in the murder of the ‘unfit’. I’ve always been very sensitive to ideas of killing people based on some notion of the ‘costs to society’ that they bring. I believe such ideas undermine our very humanity to the point where the ‘improved’ society would no longer be fit to be called human. This book is seeking to provide an answer to the question ‘what is justice?’ – or rather, it starts by questioning if it is just to help your friends and harm your enemies? I’m not sure it is immediately obvious that we might go from these questions to answers concerning the division of labour in a society – but that seems to be a major consideration of the theory of justice being presented here. Basically, people are born with various levels of merit and a just society would identify those who are favoured with whatever merit they have, and it would set them to the tasks that best suit whatever merit they have. Plato talks of the merit of people as a bit like being assigned to different metals (not unlike in the Olympics) and those people metals differentiate them into different classifications – gold, silver, bronze and iron – and each will have their proper tasks in society. Once you have been assigned to one of these classifications you are pretty much stuck there. There are tasks that are appropriate to your abilities and the just society is one where people are assigned tasks that best meet their abilities. For this reason, it is important that parents don’t know their own children and that children are brought up in common by the whole of society. That way you won’t end up with a bronze child from two gold parents being given a gold education that they will not be able to make any use of, or their bronze child wreaking havoc trying to be a philosopher king, when they would have been a better baker or blacksmith or something. All the same, the best people are still likely to have the best children and so the society should make all proper efforts to ensure that the best breeds with the best – in much the same way as you would if you were breeding race horses.The best societies would be ruled by philosopher kings – and they would not be allowed to have any possessions of their own, since they ought to be focused on the good of the society as a whole. There is a kind of threat to such people – Plato believes they would be unlikely to really give a stuff about most things that others find very rewarding. For instance, wealth, power, prestige and so on. They are likely to be seen as too ‘other worldly’, even by themselves, and therefore they are likely to be uninterested in taking on the responsibility of ruling and they might need to be encouraged. This is all for the good – because the sorts of people who want to rule are generally not the sort of people who should ever be allowed to rule. This is one of the things in which me and Plato are very much on the same page – although, for me, rather than breeding a special class of philosopher kings to rule over us, I am increasingly becoming an anarchist as I struggle to think of a single person in my life who has been a worthwhile leader. I’ve certainly never met a philosopher I would be happy to have as my king. These philosopher kings are expected to structure pretty well all aspects of life to make sure that the dumb (or rather we differently-abled with all too much base metal in our veins) are kept content in our ignorance. There are many, many things that the mass of society really shouldn’t be troubling their all too small minds over. It is also important that the philosopher kings do what they can to make sure that the rest of society doesn’t get their passions too excited by things like poetry either. A large part of religion will need to go – particularly the bits where the gods were seen fighting with each other or doing immoral things to women dressed up as bulls and such. The allegory of the cave is the most famous part of this dialogue. It concerns the nature of education. What always strikes me about it is the pain that is associated with learning the truth and how once one has learnt the truth one appears to be foolish to all those around them. But that the point of learning is to return to those who are ignorant and to be forced to attempt to explain the truth of existence to them. This is almost always a near fatal enterprise. People generally don’t like being told they are wrong and being told ‘everything you have ever thought was true is actually false’ is hardly the first line in a new romance. I keep going on about Marx’s utopia being based on the idea of there being no division of labour – so it is interesting that Plato’s is based on the exact opposite idea to this. In fact, Plato says that people really only have one thing that they are likely to be good at and that they must stick to that. He may have been both the first eugenicist, and the first Fordist/Taylorist too.His discussion of the different types of government in book viii is a bit of a highlight to this, I think. I found his discussion of democracy particularly interesting. I’m not sure I agree with it, but I thought his discussion of how it tended towards tyranny was all a bit chilling, and perhaps also a bit too close to home. The power of money to buy democracy, the fact tyrants need to remove the best of those around them and so becomes increasingly stupid, and focused on giving the people ‘what they want’ – mostly bread and circuses – looks all uncomfortably like Trump’s America writ large.
1432345270	“Republic,” it must be stipulated at the outset, is a Latin term (res publica, a “public matter”; rei publicae, "public affairs"). Therefore, "Republic" is really not the right way to translate the name of this quintessentially Greek dialogue by Plato. Its original Greek title, politeía or πολιτεία, typically means “constitution,” and might best be translated in this context as “the ideal state” – a term that Plato uses quite frequently throughout the dialogue. Yet by any name, Plato’s Republic remains one of the most important books ever written; and if you care about topics like the way in which the government of your country serves – or does not serve – its people, then you should make a point of reading The Republic.The Republic stands out among Plato’s dialogues in a number of ways. For one thing, it is among the longest of the dialogues (368 pages in this Penguin Books edition, not counting appendices and notes). For another, it has quite the cast of characters. The setting is the home of Polemarchus, a prominent resident of the Athenian port of Piraeus, and the eleven participants in the dialogue include not only Socrates and Polemarchus but also Polemarchus’ father Cephalus and brothers Glaucon and Adeimantus. Also along for the philosophical ride is the sophist Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, who here plays the role – one that will be familiar to readers of Plato’s dialogues – of sophist foil whose easy and facile assumptions are undone by Socrates’ more open-minded and ethically focused inquiries.The subject of their discussion is the politeía, the ideal state, and the shape that it would take; and from the beginning it seems clear that Plato is not trying to set forth a realistic blueprint for an actual, temporal society. In his discussion of the education that a small group of elite Guardians are to receive, in order that they may be wise and fearless defenders of the commonwealth, Plato’s Socrates declares that epic poems like Homer’s Iliad should be shorn of their grotesque and horrifying passages, as “the better they are as poetry the more unsuitable they are for the ears of children or men who are to be free and fear slavery more than death….[T]he thrill of terror they cause will make our Guardians more nervous and less tough than they should be” (p. 78). Does Plato really want to censor the Iliad? Almost certainly not; Homer’s poems were foundational texts for the classical Greek world, like the Bible for the medieval and early modern West. Rather, Plato’s purpose in this dialogue seems to be placing before the reader the contradictions that would be involved in moving from the imperfect states of the temporal realm to a theoretical “ideal” state.At the same time, Plato’s theoretical state seems downright modern in many ways. Consider, for example, the way in which Plato’s Socrates declares that “We shall have to train the women also” in hitherto male-dominated skills like hunting and keeping watch, “and train them for war as well, and treat them in the same way as the men” (p. 161). Later in the same passage, Socrates states that as “it is natural for women to take part in all occupations as well as men”, accordingly “there will also be some women fitted to be Guardians” (pp. 165-66). A fairly radical declaration for the year 380 B.C. – 2300 years before the government of the United States of America recognized women’s right to vote – and one that puts Plato light-years ahead of his one-time pupil Aristotle when it comes to gender equity.Central to The Republic is Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. We hear so much about this allegory, in so many contexts, that any first-time reader of The Republic is bound to look forward to encountering the allegory in its original context for the first time. Yet the first-time reader of The Republic may not be ready for the violence of the metaphor, or for its focus on injustice and confinement:“Imagine an underground chamber like a cave, with a long entrance open to the daylight and as wide as the cave. In this chamber are men who have been prisoners there since they were children, their legs and necks being so fastened that they can only look straight ahead of them and cannot turn their heads. Some way off, behind and higher up, a fire is burning, and between the fire and the prisoners and above them runs a road, in front of which a curtain-wall has been built, like the screen at puppet shows between the operators and their audience, above which they show their puppets" (p. 241).As translator and commentator Desmond Lee of Cambridge University points out, a modern-day analogue for Plato's cave exists in television, as Plato seems to feel that the average person's "moral and intellectual opinions often bear as little relationship to the truth as the average film or television programme does to real life" (p. 240). Such considerations carry particular weight in a time when a U.S. president has come to power in large part because large numbers of American voters connected with a mediatic public image conveyed via something called “reality television” (a contradiction in terms if ever there was one). The “ideal state” in The Republic, as with other topics like rhetoric or law-making in other dialogues, is of interest here because the shape that a political state takes has everything to with the one topic that is always Plato’s core interest: “the most important of issues…the choice between a good and an evil life” (p. 317). Accordingly, I read The Republic the same way I listen to John Lennon’s song “Imagine” (1971). When Lennon asked his listeners to “Imagine there’s no countries,” or to “Imagine no possessions…Nothing to kill or die for,” I don’t think he was expecting the citizens of his native Great Britain, or of his adopted U.S.A., to adopt such a program as a matter of practical constitutional policy. Rather, he no doubt hoped that his listeners would question an unthinking attachment to “traditional” values like nationalism, materialism, and militarism. Similarly, I believe, Plato wanted his readers, whether they were Athenian or Spartan or whatever, to question the underlying assumptions of their own societies, and to work for change where they saw fit – keeping always in mind the goal of building a state that would encourage people to be virtuous. It is, heaven knows, a goal still worth pursuing today.Desmond Lee’s classic translation, with further refinements by Rachana Kamtekar of the University of Michigan, is a great way to get to know a dialogue that is described on the dust jacket – accurately, I believe – as “the cornerstone of Western philosophy.”

3593408922	Plato's Republic (c. 375 BCE) is a Socratic dialogue in which Socrates with his interlocutors devise a conceptually ideal State. Socrates is our protagonist who is leading the discussion and is clearly dissatisfied with his government and State's structure and its system of values and justice.Plato describes an ideal State as one that encourages gender equality, education for all, meritocracy, and is ruled by no other than a philosopher-king. Nevertheless, Plato envisions a Republic that practices eugenics and enforces censorship on unsuitable writings and poems. A State in which the government is entitled to manipulate and deceive the public for the benefit of the State. Plato describes the four forms of government and their characteristics and how one evolves from the other. Timocracy will end up transforming into an oligarchy, and oligarchy to the best available form of government, democracy. Although, excessive freedom in a democratic state will lead to tyranny. Plato bases and links the various State systems to the character of its people.But the book has so much more to offer than dialogues on the various types of organized political States and governments. Plato goes on to define a true philosopher as the one who yearns for knowledge of that which is eternal and unchanging and is not disturbed by things that come to be and decay. A philosopher contemplates the essence of a thing in search of a true understanding as this is the only way to enhance and elevate the soul towards the supreme good. He sees the dialectical method of reasoning as the most effective way to arrive at a truth, while knowledge attained by pure reasoning and logic is superior to the knowledge obtained by sense perception or experiences. Plato perceives the knowledge obtained by our five senses as just copies of the ideal form that only exists and is comprehensible by our intellect. But in order to attain this knowledge, one must first comprehend the abstract science of numbers, arithmetic, and geometry.Reasoning is presented as the principal human cognitive power, followed by the process of discursive thinking, faith, and our ability to distinguish perceived images from reality. Similarly, our immortal soul's most elevated component is reason, as well, while the urges for honor and sensual pleasures are its lowest parts.I read the book in my native Montenegrin language and I look forward to a reread in an English translation.

169585109	Just to be clear, my rating is for the edition of the Republic I read- the Oxford World's Classics text translated by Robin Waterfield. Giving stars to the Republic is so flagrantly stupid that I can't even come up with a suitably stupid analogy. Giving stars to the Mona Lisa? Not even close. Giving stars to Dante? Not the same, because that deserves five stars. The Republic simultaneously deserves five stars, for kick-starting Western philosophy, social science, aesthetics, theology, and political thought. It poses a bunch of difficult questions in a way that no book before it does. That said, the arguments it uses and the answers it reaches are ridiculous and ridiculously flawed. That's okay. If you're smart enough to ask questions that keep people talking for over two millennia, you're allowed to airball the answers. You can tear the arguments of this book apart in more ways than any other work of respectable philosophy: Aristotle is way more internally coherent, even the most moronic contemporary popular 'scientist' has less absurd assumptions. Anyway, really I wanted to review the edition. It's great. Waterfield jettisons the random 'book' divisions of the Republic. Ideally, I guess, you'd just publish the thing as one long rant, but in the interests of user-friendliness Waterfield's split the text up into chapters, each one of which more or less features one argument. This makes the flow of the dialogue much easier to follow. He also breaks up steps in the arguments of the longer chapters, so you don't get lost even if you're kind of half-arsing your reading. For that alone, he'd get four stars, but his notes are *brilliant* too. Philosophically engaged, historically aware, never willing to play cheerleader to Socrates' more obvious gaffs, but willing to go out on a limb to defend something that initially seems implausible. Waterfield's guiding thread is that you really should read the book as what it says it is: an investigation into morality (often translated as justice elsewhere), which proceeds by way of analogy. The political stuff is secondary; the real goal is to defend the idea that the moral person is happier and better in the long run. I say all this despite disagreeing with Waterfield's argument that the forms aren't metaphysical. I know why philosophers say that; the idea that Plato thought there were real Divine Bedframes floating somewhere in the fifth dimension is ridiculous. But he pretty clearly thought that ridiculous thing. Not because he was an idiot, though: he wanted to anchor truth is something which actually existed, but acknowledged the real lack of truthiness/justice/morality in the world as he found it. Good for him.

740851582	Theorising the Perfect State21 October 2013 Sometimes I wonder if people give this book five stars because it is either a) written by Plato, or b) if you don't give it five stars then you are afraid that people will think that you are some semi-literate mindless cretin whose reading capacity tends to extend little beyond the Harry Potter and Twilight Series. Yes, I realise that I have given it five stars, but I have given it five stars because I actually enjoyed the argument that this book outlines. Basically it is a very logical argument that examines the nature of the human soul and of justice and the structure of the argument is of the sort that you could only expect to see from a master. Mind you, some of the points that Plato makes, such as physicians role being only to maintain the health of society and not to heal or care for the sick or injured (thus simply letting them die) would be repugnant not only to us (to an extent) but also to the people of his day. However it is the way that the argument flows, and the way that Plato explores concepts that are relevant even to us today that makes me think highly of this work of literature. First of all, let us consider the context of the book. This was written after the death of Socrates which meant that the democratic model that Athens had been based upon had failed, and this it was quite clear to Plato and his contemporaries that democracy had failed. As such, when writing about the perfect society, one could not write about a democracy, and if one did, one needed to outline how the previous experiment failed and how it could be improved. This is the case today with socialists examining how the Russian experiment failed, but seeking to build upon its ideals to create a government that will avoid those mistakes. However, in Plato's mind, this could not happen simply because he knew that the basic foundations of the democratic state could not support a functioning ideal government. The main reason for that is that, like our democratic system, the power brokers not only tended to be rich, but also very well spoken, meaning that the populace could easily be swayed and end up supporting the power-brokers flawed, and in many cases self-centered, policies. However, while many consider that the Republic is about an idea of how to construct a perfect state, the treatise itself goes far beyond that because what it is actually looking at is the idea of perfect justice. Near the end of the treatise Plato once again outlines his theory of forms, which is that everything in this world his a pale reflection of the object's perfect form. For instance, all tables that we see are a reflection of a perfect table, and as tables can only be created by people who make tables, and because all table makers are different, it is thus impossible to create the perfect form of a table. However to help us understand this concept further, Plato brings out the idea of art. A painting of a table is a mere reflection of the table that is painted, and every painting of that table will be different and no painter is able to paint that table as it truly is – the painter is basically restrained by the medium of which the painter creates the table. The same goes with poetry, because the poet is only able to create a pale reflection of the event that the poet is writing the poem about, and no poet, through the medium of poetry, is able to create a perfect reflection of that event. Thus, what Plato is doing is he is applying his theory to that of government. Thus every government is a reflection of the perfect government, and no government can replicate the perfect form of government. Further still, being a philosopher, Plato is restrained from being able to describe exactly what that perfect government is because he is restrained by the medium of which is uses to outline what he believes the perfect form of government is. That, by the way, is very important - what he believes the perfect form of government to be. The major restraint that Plato faces in outlining the perfect form is that it is his opinion, and his opinion is quite possibly wrong. However, let us consider what this government is. First of all, it is not a democracy, and has no democratic institutions. The government is a oligarchic state which is ruled by philosophers, with the philosopher king at the top of the chain. It is also a very stratified form of government, with three castes, namely the ruling caste, the warrior caste (known as the Guardians), and the working caste. We must remember also that there is no room for anybody who cannot fit into any of these castes, thus the sick, injured, or disabled, have no part in this society because they are not able to fulfil any meaningful role within the state. However your caste his not determined by your birth, which means that just because you are born to working class parents does not mean you are automatically a part of the working class, and as such, just because you are born among the ruling class does not mean you are automatically members of the ruling class. A few further points that I note is that Plato endorses religion in his state, but this is not surprising considering the Greeks were very religious people. However, Plato does not see a need to comment on religion, and while it is the case that there were philosophers who were atheists, Plato, nor his teacher Socrates, were one of them. Plato also does not support the idea of family, and actually believes that it should be abolished (though he does support monogamous marriage). I suspect that is this because the family unit tends to be a very tight unit, and if allowed in such a stratified society, having a family unit would mean that the idea of a person being a member of a specific class based on skill would fall apart as the members of a family in a specific class would not allow their children to fall down to a lower class. Plato also believes in the abolition of wealth and property, which means that his state is a socialist state. Once again this is not surprising considering that most dictatorships tend to have the wealth concentrated at the top, with the rulers effectively being the progenitors of a kelptocracy. However, it is also the case in the democracies where wealth creates privilege, and privilege creates power. Just as it is today, the wealthy of fifth century Athens were able to buy the best minds to write their arguments and promote their policies to the detriment of the poorer classes. A democracy could quite well also be considered a form of kleptocracy. Finally, Plato advocates censorship, particularly in education. He indicates that there are some things that should not be taught to our young for fear that our young may not understand what is being taught. This is very much the case today because there is a form of censorship that is basically accepted, and that is the rating systems for our movies, and now for our computer games. One cannot release a movie in an advanced democracy without getting the approval of the ratings agency. Further, studios will purposely self censor a movie so that it will receive a certain rating so that more people will go and see it and will be willing to see it.
1156572603	A man, tired from a long day of drudgery at work, walks towards his favourite haunt, an old-fashioned British working class pub in Essex called 'The Griffon'. Drenched from a heavy fall of rain, he enters the building and is greeted by its familiar smells and sounds. Man: “Evening, all.” (The patrons demurely acknowledge his presence, and return to their drinks. The face of Roger, a much older man, lights up as he joyously steps towards the newcomer) Roger: “Nate, ye bastard! Where have ye been all this time? Stuck in a sheep’s backside?”(he guffaws, while shaking his friend's hand)Nate [smiling feebly]: “Evening, Roger. Oh no, nothing as queer like that. Had some family business to attend to. I also have been busy reading, as a matter of fact..”Roger: “Reading? You?”Nate [feeling slight shame]: “Yes..”Roger:“Didn’t peg you as the intellectual type, mate.”Nate: “Oh, I am not, I can assure you. Let me explain. You know about that particularly nasty storm a forthnight ago?" Roger:"Aye, the Great Storm of 2017. Already a legend in these parts." Nate:"Well, I got myself caught in the open street during its peak, and sought shelter in the nearest building. Turned out it was the bloody library! Quite a shock, let me tell you." Roger: “Really? I didn’t even know we had one! Didn’t Thatcher close it down back in the eighties? What the hell else did we elect her for?”(he falls prey to a violent fit of laughter, and is soon joined by the others) (Nate waits until the noise dies down and soberly resumes his tale) "All right, men, in all seriousness now. So here I found myself in that building I had never been in before, and which I couldn’t wait to leave. But, since the storm didn’t show any sign of abating, I thought it best to stay put and kill some time browsing. What else’s a man to do, eh? Well, for some reason I ended up in the philosophy section, and found this book titled the Republic by this fella named Plato. Does that ring a bell with anyone?”(A stout little man named Edmund enters the conversation) “Plato? Famous bloke, innit?”Nate: “Yes, rather. In it he sort of details how society should be run by so-called philosopher kings. Rather strict in his way of approaching it, methinks. Not a lot of freedom, or much fun at all really.” Roger: “Hmm. Got you to keep flippin' the pages though, no?”Nate: “Pretty much. The missus always said I was a right philistine, and should get some more culture in my system. The back cover did mention it was ‘a foundational text of Western civilisation’, so I figured I might bloody well start there. I read for an hour or so, and then took it home. First time I applied for a library card, funnily enough. Finished the whole thing in two weeks. I felt real smart for an instance there. A fine feat of self-improvement, if I do say so myself.”(A fierce looking, burly man who goes by the name of Carlyle interrupts): “A philosopher, eh? Bah! Let me tell you something, lad. Buy these fine gentlemen (he intently looks around the room) enough pints of lager and they’ll all be “philosophizin’” soon enough. Isn’t that right, men?” (the whole room shakes with laughter)Nate [uneasy]:“Well, Plato sort of advocated that philosophy is a serious business, to be handled with a clear, well-educated mind, you know. Among other things, he also viewed alcohol as a possible hindrance to that. So that’s us out, I’m afraid.”Roger [jumping in]: “He did, did he? Well, I am a working man with a wife and the fruit of my overactive loins to provide for. After eight hours of breaking my back in the factory, I just want to go to me pub, unwind and drink my scotch. Anything other than that is a damned luxury. Ya see my meaning here?”Nate: [exasperatedly sighs]“I do, and you’re probably right. More than likely, reading these things is a waste of time anyway for folk like us.”Roger: [approvingly] “That’s the spirit, laddie! Don’t concern yourself with these things, it is quite useless. We are simple folk, ye know, who don’t count at all in the grand scheme of things. Trust me, I have seen it all. Best enjoy what we have and hope for the best. Leave that lofty thinkin’ to those smug arseholes in their lofty places. I wouldn’t have it any other way meself. Damn proud to be a nobody at the bottom. At least there is honour in that. (He pauzes for a moment, immersed in thought)Bah, enough of this. Barman, a round of drinks for all!”(They all erupt into loud shouts of appreciation)
2486792348	Plato is one of those writers/philosophers who is very hard to comprehend if you haven’t read him before or not interested in Philosophy. Socrates, his master is a bit mellow in his way of teaching. In this book, Socrates is having a discussion with four others about the different variants that comprise of a 'STATE'. Justice is also one of the main themes in the book as justice provides a parameter of guidance among the people and how they would treat one another. Though this book is full of interesting themes, however it is at times too much discussed and elaborated upon which makes it a bit demanding and challenging.Blog | YouTube | Instagram | Facebook | LinkedIn
5123114867	I studied this book for A-Level Philosophy at college and loved it. Plato's allegories were so rich and detailed and still very relevant. We studied Plato alongside Karl Marx and I came to the conclusion that The Republic was Plato's political manifesto to argue that Philosophers are the only people fully equipt to rule the masses. I came away feeling like Marx was more a Philosopher who wanted to change politics and Plato was a politician who was using philosophy to secure power.Still a great read!
4725076593	Me propuse este año leer más libros de filosofía, y en el marco de ese plan, "La República" parecía una elección obvia. Antes de leerlo, solo tenía una vaga idea del tema del libro. Sabía que Platón describía aquí su Estado ideal, en uno de los tratados de teoría política más antiguos de la historia. En rigor de verdad, sin embargo, el libro trata muchos más temas que el Estado ideal. Al ser un libro tan antiguo, ha tenido muchas interpretaciones diferentes con el paso del tiempo. En lo personal, me sorprendió descubrir lo mucho que la utopía platónica se asemeja en realidad a una distopía de acuerdo a los standards modernos: es un Estado regido por un sistema de castas, donde en el pináculo se ubican los filósofos. En este Estado se practica la censura, usando para ello el argumento paternalista: no hay que dejar que ideas extrañas contaminen la mente de la gente, de modo que es mejor dejar que unos pocos elegidos decidan qué pueden escuchar o leer el resto. Es un Estado donde se practican formas primitivas de eugenesia (el gobierno tendría la potestad de decidir quién puede tener hijos, quién no, y asignar las parejas) y eutanasia. Desde el punto de vista económico, es un estado comunista, toda vez que la comunidad de bienes, inmuebles y muebles, son de todos y de nadie. Tampoco se permite la familia: la noción es erradicada y los niños son criados por el Estado, que los selecciona en edad temprana en virtud de los talentos que manifiestan para ser educados en una de las castas. Mientras más uno lo piensa, menos gustaría vivir en un lugar como el que describe Platón.Naturalmente, lo juzgamos de acuerdo a nuestras nociones modernas. Con el beneficio del conocimiento retrospectivo es fácil criticar. Platón instituyó su comunismo económico como una forma de responder a la brecha en las clases sociales y al poder de la oligarquía-agudas críticas que todavía resuenan en el mundo moderno-y la casta de filósofos para prevenir que políticos populistas se aprovecharan de la masa ignorante e impulsiva para alcanzar el poder-nuevamente, otra crítica que resuena actualmente.Sí se puede criticar que Platón en realidad, a lo largo de La República, presenta sus argumentos como imbatibles: no hay espacio para reconocer que sus teorías pueden estar erradas, o que no se pueden aplicar en todas partes sin tomar en cuenta las características políticas o sociales de los pueblos donde se impondrían. Es por eso que no le doy 5 estrellas. Más allá de eso, el libro no se detiene ahí. Aquí Platón elabora su famosa "historia de la caverna", acaso uno de los planteos filosóficos más importantes de la historia, y elabora sobre muchas otras cuestiones, como la justicia, el alma, e incluso, una teoría de la reencarnación (esto particularmente me sorprendió, porque hasta donde sabía de la cultura de la Grecia antigua, no sabía que hubiera ni siquiera una mención de la reencarnación).Tan solo por su portento, su visión, su agudeza intelectual, aunque no compartamos sus tesis, es un libro que todos deberíamos leer.

2554605121	"Sva zapadna filozifija je serija fusnota Platonu," rekao je neko. Neko drugi "treba ga čitati ceo život". Šta ja da dodam? Više za sebe, da se setim kasnije svog razmišljanja nakon prvog čitanja.Ovaj mega-dijalog o organizaciji i strukturama društva, politici i državi, ali pre svega o pravičnosti i o tome kako treba živeti (ukratko: bolje, mada ne uvek i unosnije, je biti pravičan), jednostavan je za čitanje. Obično slušaoci pred Sokrata postavljaju neko mišljenje (npr. "Nepravičnost je dobra za onog ko je počini, loša za sve ostale. Pravičnost je dobra za ostale, loša za onog ko je čini."), koje on onda preokreće, lomi, kontra-argumentuje... Dijalozi su ponekad literarno odlično napisani, drugi put opet prosti, kad mu učenici odgovaraju kao da su bez mozga, klimaju i potvrđuju njegove reči, tek toliko da se uključe... Na trenutke ni argumentacija nije najoštrija, ponekad toliko da mi se čini da to radi namerno, kako bi se kasnije vraćao na iste teme ili te uključio da se usprotiviš. Ima tu dosta argumenata sa kojima se ne slažem, ma koliko se potrudio da ih uspostavi. Cenzura, na primer. Razlike među polovima, vaspitavanje dece ili odnos prema robovima. Kao i pojedini delovi o organizaciji države, pored kojih mogu da zamislim Musolinija kako ih podvlači i koristi u argumentaciji. Ima i konkretnih predloga kako organizovati državu ili grad koji zvuče naivno i zastarelo. Nisam siguran da su ti predlozi ikad bili zamišljeni realno. Toliko su daleko od stvarnih društava, da su možda tu kao neka ironija. Ima i segmenata kad započne na jednu temu, pa stane i ne vrati joj se sledećih pedesetak strana. Nervirao me je kako je jedno vreme mlako branio pravičnost. Ali, i pored toga, ovo je vrhunski unutrašnji doživljaj, misaona vežba koja se čita odlično. Staromodna izgradnja argumentacije, polako, strpljivo, uz postavljanje temelja i primere koji na prvi pogled nemaju veze sa tim što argumentuje.Tu su, naravno, i dve poznate priče koje koristi da poentira: Pećina i Gigov prsten. Državu treba pročitati samo zbog njih, ako ništa drugo. Od dijaloga, čitao sam zasad još samo Odbranu Sokratovu, koja je direktnija i jednostavnija. Država je idealna za podvlačenje, komentare na marginama... (pišem: 'Prva knjiga je bila vožnja u prvoj, sad je prebacio u petu!'). Moje Deretino izdanje je masakrirano, biće interesantno čitati ga ponovo i čuditi se kako sam neke stvari shvatio potpuno pogrešno.
1780432835	I almost categorised this as a dystopian novel because while Plato finds his Republic to be ideal, it sounded too much like what Trump intends for Amerikkka. It is an essential read in terms of western philosophy particularly because of the cave analogy and its opposition to the Aristotelian manner of thinking that created the major division in Greek philosophy and continues to underpin politics ever since. In his taking the ideal to be more critical than the real world, Plato creates a model and expects everyone to adhere to it (which is how I see the current american political right where their measuring stick is the Bible) whereas Aristotle was looking at empirical data to derive conclusions and draw up policy (how I see the current american political left but of the Sanders variety rather than the HRC variety). Unfortunately, few have been able to bridge this divide - Kant perhaps, Nietzsche embracing chaos and absolutism...and yet the greatest political philosophers of the 19th and 20th century still come down on one side or the other (see Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind). A critical read in any case for understanding once again how we got to where we are although not necessarily a roadmap to change things - that will have to come out of your critical reading and optimist imagination afterwards.
1829034479	¡Qué mente la de Platón!Esta edición es un resumen de la famosa República del filósofo griego.Con sus diez libros, La República nos sumerge en el análisis del hombre, y su comportamiento (justos e injustos); del bien y del mal; de las ciudades y las formas de gobierno; de la importancia de la educación y de seguir la ley. Platón logra hablar de todo esto a partir de diálogos con variados personajes, especialmente Glaucón, y también a través de la hipótesis de creación de una ciudad perfecta, con todo lo que ello implica: educación, comportamiento y trabajo de sus ciudadanos, forma de gobierno y leyes. Lo que más me ha gustado es el mito de la caverna, que aparece en el séptimo libro y la historia que cuenta al final sobre la existencia de las almas.Obviamente este es buen libro, pero considero que se debe encarar con ganas, ya seas fanático de la filosofía o solo estés interesado. Recomendable.

19458829	(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)The CCLaP 100: In which I read a hundred so-called "classic" books for the first time, then write reports on whether or not I think they deserve the labelEssay #11: The Republic, by Plato (~360 BC)The story in a nutshell:For those who don't know, the last 2,500 years of Western civilization can be roughly broken down into three eras, or "Ages;" the one we're in the middle of right now, the "Modern Age," actually began around the year 1400 or so with what we now call the "Renaissance," in which humanity slowly rediscovered the ideas and philosophies of ancient Greece and other so-called "enlightened societies" from the dawn of written history. (The era of those societies, then, is known as the "Classical Age;" the years between these two eras is known as the "Middle Age" or "Dark Age," in that these were the years such information was lost and forgotten in the first place.) Of all these thinkers and playwrights and architects and scientists of ancient Greece, then, perhaps none was more influential than a man named Socrates, who in our modern days we would call both an educator and philosopher; although he never actually wrote down any of his thoughts about life, his fanboy students did on a voracious basis, including a disciple named Plato who became the most famous of them during the Renaissance, because of so many of his original manuscripts making it through the chaotic times of the Dark Age*.The Republic, for example, which would be better translated in our modern language to Society, is one of the more important of the dozens of Plato's books to still exist; it is one of the first books in Western culture, in fact, to tackle the very question of what a society is, of how to best organize one, and how to lay the long-term plans to make such a "republic" stable and violence-free. For example, the whole first part of the book tackles nothing else but what Socrates saw as the fundamental question behind all societies, that of "justice;" of how we as an organized group of people determine what exactly is "fair," what exactly is "right" and "wrong," and how we go about not only formally defining that but also enforcing it on a society-wide basis. That then gets the group talking about the creation of laws, which gets into the subject of who in a society is best qualified to write and determine such laws; this gets the reader into what most consider part 2 of the book, an examination of what we today would call not only lawyers but also politicians, philosophers and educators. (Plato and his peers, in fact, believed that the enlightened citizen should be all of these things at once; it's only in our modern times that we split them into four different professions.) This then gets us into part 3 of The Republic, a detailed examination of four popular types of society that were around at the time; this is what gets us our modern definitions of timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny, and of course the dozens of other government types that have since been invented by later philosophers.And then finally, the way Socrates and his students actually discuss and arrive at these conclusions is through what is now known as the "Socratic Method," a fancy term for something most people will immediately understand; it's simply the process of teaching through talking and asking questions, guiding a student through a series of answers into discovering the wisdom of that topic on their own. Anytime a public school teacher discusses a subject out loud in a classroom, for example, then calls on a student to answer a question about the subject, that technically is the Socratic Method.The argument for it being a classic:Dude, it's a 2,200-year-old book that's still being read on a daily basis; if that's not the definition of a classic, fans say, then what is? Much more importantly than this, though, The Republic and other Classical books of philosophy virtually defined how nearly the entire western half of the planet currently conducts its business; all modern free-market representational democracies, after all, are fundamentally based on the ideas of the "Enlightenment" philosophers of the 1700s, and their ideas originally came from the ideas of Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and others. There's nothing like reading the actual source material, fans of Classical literature will tell you, if you want a deep understanding of the principles guiding all of Western culture; this one single book, for example, laid the groundwork for how over half the world's governments now operate, making it the very definition of a book you should read before you die.The argument against:Of course, let's not forget the price of reading a 2,200-year-old book of philosophy, which is that much of it is out-of-date by now; in fact, there's an entire litany of terms in The Republic that a reader must put air quotes around each time they come across, with "democracy" for example not meaning nearly the same thing to Plato that it means to us, nor "republic," nor "equality," nor "freedom." Two thousand years is a long time to be able to tweak and build on a certain set of specific ideas, let's not forget; in fact, most of the incremental improvements we make to government anymore are based on principles from merely a half-century or so ago, which themselves were the product of the 75th or 80th generation of small improvements that have now been made over the centuries to Plato and Socrates' original ideas. Because of all this, critics say, a book like The Republic is certainly historically important, certainly a must-read for anyone devoting their life or career to philosophy or government or education, but not necessarily a book that the general populace should feel a need to read themselves.My verdict:So let me admit right off the bat what a p-ssy I am, and that in actuality I only read something like the first hundred pages of this book; because let's face it, we live in a much more sophisticated age than Plato did, with most of us for example deeply comfortable with the Socratic Method even by the time we're done with elementary school. The Republic itself is written in the same pace one would use when explaining something to a five-year-old child, which of course Plato and his co-horts had to do back then; it was a society that was barely literate, that had never tackled these subjects before, who hadn't even invented such words as "philosophy" yet or such concepts as universities. To tell you the truth, the most interesting thing about the book was in fact the modern 50-page introduction by Desmond Lee (I read the Penguin Classics version); like many other synopses that now exist, it does a much better job than the manuscript itself at explaining the historical context that informed these ideas, as well as the outdated terminology and the words that would be better used today. Although it was definitely a fascinating book to explore and learn more about, I can't say in all honesty that I would recommend tackling the actual manuscript; much better I think to read one of the modern analyses instead, and learn more about how the book has shaped society in the two thousand years since.Is it a classic? Yes, but skip it anyway*And in fact, the majority of the Classical Canon would be gone forever if had been up to the Westerners themselves, who were too busy slaughtering and raping and burning down each others' cities during the Medieval period to give much of a crap about a bunch of dusty ol' books; it was mostly the scholars of the Middle East who saved the majority of these manuscripts, by translating them into Arabic and incorporating them into their own great libraries at Alexandria (in modern Egypt), Babylon (in modern Iraq), and more. Bitter irony, I know, considering the way the majority of Middle East states have been treated by the majority of Western nations over the last couple of hundred years.
4314514722	115th book of 2021.It’s no secret that Plato isn’t fool-proof. A lot of the arguments within the 400 or so pages of Republic are what one might call a ‘stretch’—Plato has some (mostly) friendly men to converse with who are very fond of telling him how brilliant he is and how his points are well-founded. The truth is, this does not happen in arguments, because there are always two people (or is this only in my own case?) trying to prove their own viewpoints, and in the end they both resist and persist so much that it frizzles out or they become sore with one another, or both. If I were to sit down with some friends and attempt something like Republic, it would be anarchy and we would probably not agree on a single thing. The idea that just two people could settle on creating a utopian society through dialogue is almost unfathomable. But where we cannot imagine it in real life, we can read it about it here in Plato, and, surprisingly, enjoy it as we do so.As ever, Socrates is the ‘I’ of Republic, Plato’s mentor. The question at the heart of this book is simply, Why be moral when immortality seems to benefit more? What’s the point in being good? Socrates, photo taken by me several weeks ago in the British Museum. The book is comprised of 14 dialogues*, all of which are fairly similar to other dialogues I've read by Plato, particularly the first few. Though some I disagree with, there are many parts of the dialogues that I respect and some that, if nothing else, I find interesting to consider. In Chapter IV, Socrates says, 'The point is that a young person can't tell when something is allegorical and when it isn't, and any idea admitted by a person of that age tends to become almost ineradicable and permanent. All things considered, then, that is why a very great deal of importance should be placed upon ensuring that the first stories they hear are best adapted for their moral improvement.' This is one of those 'if nothing else, I find interesting to consider' moments. I work with children a lot of the time when teaching and often baulk at things they allude to, be it TV Shows or certain video games they have seemed to have played at an early age. Already this singular line from Socrates could spin an entire web of arguments about what to tell your child/what they can watch/what they can do. I know a mother who refused anyone reminding her children, even when her children were nearing 10-years-old, where the meat on their plate came from. Chapter IV had many parts that I underlined, particularly when Socrates said, 'I mean, it's a good mind that makes someone good.' This line of thought reminds me of Harold Bloom in his defence of reading classics, reading only the best literature has to offer because what you own in your head through reading, also owns you. Socrates concludes Chapter IV after discussing a balance of physical education and cultural education (too much of the former makes one brutal, too much of the latter makes one docile) with 'it's the person who makes the best blend of physical exercise and culture, and who applies them to the mind in the right proportions, whom we should really describe as a virtuoso and as having the most harmony in his life.' It reminds me of something Kierkegaard once wrote, I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it…but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill…Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right. The book is too rich to attempt to review without writing incessantly for hours, and having further conversations off each point from the book. Here are some quotes I underlined:''Isn't the phrase "self-mastery" absurd? I mean, anyone who is his own master is also his own slave''''So, Glaucon,' I said, 'it seems likely that this is in a sense what morality is—doing one's own job.''''But it's like this: it makes no difference whether you fall into a little pool or into the middle of the largest ocean—you're still swimming.''''Unless communities have philosophers as kings,' I said, 'or the people who are currently called kings and rulers practise philosophy with enough integrity [...] there can be no end to political trouble.'' ''So because a philosopher's links are with a realm which is divine and orderly, he becomes as divine and orderly as is humanly possible.''''It is, in fact, really hard for people to have confidence in the fact that studying this kind of subject cleans and re-ignites a particular mental organ which everyone has (while other occupations ruin it and blind it), and that this organ is a thousand times more worth preserving that any eye, since it is the only organ which can see truth.'' As for answering the central question, I will speak nothing of it here. The final Chapter was perhaps the best, a Dante like experience and explanation of where the souls go after death including my favourite Greek figure, Odysseus himself, as an example. I would recommend Republic for this final part alone. The rest of the book isn't always sound in its debate, but it is almost always readable and enjoyable, considering the reputation the book has as being one of the cornerstones of Western philosophy and literature. As far as reading Plato for the first time goes, Symposium is far, far, shorter and in some ways better, surrounded around the idea of love and what love is, something everyone can relate to faster than the idea of morality, politics and state as seen in these pages. I feel fairly happy with what I've read of Plato now and can move onto reading some Aristotle at last. I would love to end the review with some allusion to the end of the book, with Odysseus' choice when choosing a new soul and what that means for the rest of us and our lives and how we can learn from his choice, but that would be spoiling it; and the more beautiful something is, the worse a crime it is to spoil it. ____________________________________*1.

3378784804	"Uopšte nije važno da li ovakva država negdje stvarno postoji ili će tek u budućnosti postojati."Čudo je Platon! Kolikogod da se iščitavaju njegovi dijalozi, svaki put će se uočavati odlomci koji su ranije promicali i uvijek će se rađati pitanja i dileme koje vam ranije nisu padale na pamet. Kada bih morao provesti ostatak života na nekom pustom ostrvu imajući dozvolu da sa sobom ponesem kompletna djela samo jednog autora, definitivno bih odabrao Platona.Ocjene o "Državi" variraju od one populističke, po kojoj je Sokrat vodio dijalog-monolog sa intelektualno zaostalim klimoglavcima (čemu sam nekada davno i sam bio pomalo naklonjen - ako ćemo pravo), pa sve dotle da se smatra najvrijednijim ostvarenjem u istoriji filozofije. Ima jedan prikaz u kome se Platon doslovno naziva idiotom, što me ne bi toliko ražalostilo da taj prikaz nema ubjedljivo najviše lajkova (među njih preko 3300!). Francuski filozof ruskog porijekla Aleksandar Kožev je napisao knjigu "Kako čitati Hegela?"; mislim da i Platon potrebuje jedan takav priručnik, imajući u vidu to da su - u odnosu na druge velike filozofe - šanse da kod njega odemo na stranputicu znatno veće - što zbog dijaloške forme i svima razumljive terminologije (naizgled olakšavajuće), što usljed toga što su Platonova pisana učenja samo obrisi i nagovještaji onoga što se moglo čuti na njegovim predavanjima, a dobrim dijelom i zbog Sokratove ironije i višesmislenih mističko-mitoloških ekskursa, koji prosječnog homo sapiensa lako odvode u ćorsokak. Tu zazornost od pisane riječi - a vrlo vjerovatno i od mogućnosti da i sam bude pogrešno shvaćen - Platon je izrazio u "Fedru", govoreći o slovima: "Kad su jedanput napisana, svaka riječ tumara ovamo i onamo, isto tako k onima koji je ne razumiju kao i onima kojima nije namjenjena, pa se ne zna s kime treba govoriti, a s kime ne. A zlostavljena i nepravična ružena uvijek treba roditelja kao pomoćnika: jer sama niti može sebe odbraniti niti sebi pomoći." Za onoga ko umije da čita i da čitajući otključava - što je rijedak i potcijenjen dar - Platonovi dijalozi otvaraju mali milion vrata i vratanaca. U Sokratovom dijalektičkom vrtlogu se ne nude rješenja, nego se razmatraju mogućnosti; manje je važno o čemu se tu raspravlja, smisao je u samom vrtlogu; u njemu se čitalac podstiče da misli, da iznalazi sopstvene odgovore i osmišljava sopstvena pitanja; zbog toga je druženje sa Platonom - pod uslovom da ga se čita na pravi način - uvijek cjeloživotno, a njegova pojava jedinstvena u čitavoj istoriji filozofije.

2827266593	The book is a dialogue among the students. Where some serious questions have been asked. Like, what is a reality? What is good and bad? The book tries t capture all the forces of earth and translate them into a constructive idea. It talks about almost all thing. How should be an idle society look like, how should be an individual. The book is a must-read for everyone who wants to understand the depth of life.
1304492990	Let me tell you about this book. Well, I don't recall it much; I only recall the angst it caused me for in my first year of college there were only two classes left that looked somewhat interesting. First time; last served. I took Philosophy 101 and Child Psychology. I walked into my philosophy class and thought it was really going to be interesting. The teacher, Mr. Flores, spoke in broken English. No one told me that I could drop out of a class, so I sat there. I couldn't take notes because I didn't know what he was saying. I read this book, and I was still struggling. A student suggested Cliffs Notes. They helped. The test didn't include anything in the book, what it included was his lectures. But with the help of the Notes, I got a C in the class. I didn't even know then that I could take the class over and change that grade. And one other thing happened in the class. I was always afraid to speak in public, but Mr. Flores said that we had to give a speech. It didn't matter how short or how long it was. If we gave it we would pass. I found a cartoon, and I got up in front of the class. This is what happened: "This is a theological question. Is there life after death? I don't know if there is life before death." I went to sit down, and a student said, "Don't you consider yourself part of this rat race?" I said, "What rat race?" Then the professor said, "That was using the system." And another student said, "Does she get credit for that?" "Yes," he said. And I smiled. But maybe taking the class helped me in other ways, for I knew then that I needed to get a lot of As in order to get rid of that C, and when I quit going to college 12 years later, I had a 3.38 grade point average. I still needed more As. I never graduated because I didn't want to take some required classes. So I spent those years changing majors and taking whatever sounded good. I considered myself a college bum and just quit when I was burned out. Now I just read books I like.
1982656013	بخشی از چیزهایی که در موردِ جمهور به نظرم مهم‌ هستند:منظورِ افلاطون از «جمهور» در عنوانِ کتاب نوعِ حکومتِ جمهوری نیست. منظور تأسیسِ شهر، حکومت یا جامعه است.افلاطون جمهور را از زبانِ سقراط نقل می‌کند. موضوعِ اصلی عدالت است. عدالت نه به معنای امروزی آن، بلکه به مثابهِ چتری که زیر آن همه‌ی فضایلی قرار می‌گیرد که معمولاً همگان نیک می‌‌دانند. عدالت از منظرِ ذاتی و کارکرد در تقابل با ظلم بررسی می‌شود. افلاطون می‌کوشد ثابت کند عدالت فضیلتی است که هم برای شخصِ عادل و هم برای جامعه نفعِ بیشتری از ظلم دارد. آرمانشهر، شهری است که افلاطون آن را بهترینِ شهرها می‌خواند و اجرایِ عدالت را لازمه‌ی آن می‌داند. با جزئیات آن را توصیف می‌کند و برای ساخت و حفظش با وسواس دستورالعمل‌هایی را صادر می‌کند. همه‌ی ارکانِ شهر را با جزئیات توصیف می‌کند، از طبقات اجتماعی گرفته تا صنایع، آموزش و پروش، اقتصاد، فرهنگ و ... . فلسفه و فلاسفه در آرمانشهرِ افلاطون رکنِ اصلی هستند.افلاطون در جمهور نظریه‌ی مُثُل را شرح می‌دهد. او معتقد است از هر چه در جهان وجود دارد، ایده‌‌ و مثالی در کامل‌ترین حالتِ ممکن در جایِ دیگری قرار داد، نسخه‌ای معقول و نامتغیر.آنچه دیالکتیک یا جدل می‌خوانیم، به اعتباری همین روشِ افلاطون است در جمهور. گفتگو در جمهور سوار بر رشته‌ای از پرسش و پاسخ‌ به سمت حقیقت حرکت می‌کند و به مرور تصویری کامل‌تر و دقیق‌تر از حقیقت نمایان می‌شود.
14580391	I'm not sure why people read this. For those interested in the history of philosophy it's undoubtedly important. For everyone else... meh. A lot of people comment that Plato deals seriously with all the big issues. Well, he brings them up, but never seriously engages with them.Maybe the problem is that I'm reading this at 25 after spending a couple years seriously reading philosophy. Maybe Popper inoculated me. I might have felt differently if I started reading The Republic with a less critical eye. I honestly found myself giggling at some of Plato's arguments, due to their specious, and often obviously false nature. Plato's rhetorical style is also laughable. The format for much of the book is this: a topic is introduced, "rules for allowable art" for example. Next, Plato makes a dishonest but true-on-the-surface argument. Listener agrees wholeheartedly. Plato uses that simple argument to argue for some ridiculous position like actors not being allowed to play bad men or women or children because they might become like bad men, women, or children. My big criticism is that for most of the book, the listeners do nothing but agree. They are at least interesting in the first book, but by the second have been reduced to a sycophantic chorus. This is a representative snippet of Plato proving that an unjust person is not clever or good.“And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whetheryou think that any man who has knowledge ever would wish tohave the choice of saying or doing more than another man whohas knowledge. Would he not rather say or do the same as hislike in the same case? That, I suppose, can hardly be denied. And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have morethan either the knowing or the ignorant?”His reasoning goes: a knowledgeable man never tries to outdo or be different from another knowledgeable man, and knowledge is good. An unjust man tries to outdo other unjust men, so is not good. There's more to the argument than that, but no one ever challenges this (arguably false) assumption that competition and difference are inherently unwise and ungood. If Plato doesn't bother to think about that, why should I bother to think about Plato. There's a dozen better Greek texts, and a rereading of The Orestia will teach you a lot more about life. If you want to think about justice pick up some Rawls. Seriously, this should have been buried with Sparta.
1516768721	كم قتلونا بما أسموه: واقعية!حولونا إلى آلات، وفي كثير من الأحيان -أعتذر- حيوانات، وصوروا لنا المثالية أحلامًا يهواها المنفصلون عن الحياة وواقعيتها.. وبالفعل تشكلت هذه المكررات ثقافةً أصبحنا عليها لنبيت على تطبيقاتها، فقُتل العقل القيمي الواقعي في أعلى درجات المثالية، وبقيت فلسفة الصراع وفنون الغلبة تارة بالإقصاء السافر، وتارة أخرى كما هي بعض المذاهب البرمجية اليوم بالتلون والمخادعات الأخلاقية.أفلاطون.. كان عقلًا تحليليًا فلسفيًا يعي ما يقول بواقعية مثالية لم أجد كمالها في غير الطرح الإسلامي الرصين، وهذا ما يظهر من التقديم العلمي للأستاذ أحمد المنياوي في كتابه: (جمهورية أفلاطون، المدينة الفاضلة كما تصورها فيلسوف الفلاسفة).في تصوري أنَّ الكتاب مناسب إلى أن يكون تقديمًا لمحاورات أفلاطون التي أجراها على لسان أستاذه سقراط وألسنة مجموعة من تلامذته، ولذلك فهو ليس بالكتاب البحثي النقدي، وربَّما كان من حسن التوفيق أنَّني قد قرأت المحاورات كاملة قبل سنتين أو أكثر، فبدت الصورة لي أكثر وضوحًا.ينطلق أفلاطون في نظريته من الضرورة بالمعنى التكويني الفلسفي للعدالة في قيام المجتمع الفاضل الذي يقسمه مكونه البشري إلى ثلاثة أقسام بحسب القوى النفسانية (الشهوانية والغضبية والعاقلة)، ويرى أنَّ تشكيل الدولة ينبغي أن يضبط انطلاقًا من هذه القوى، فيكون الحكم للفلاسفة والحماية العسكرية لأصحاب العاطفة من الشجعان باعتبار أنَّ الشجاعة محلُّها القلب، وأمَّا القوة الاقتصادية فيوكل أمرها لمن غلبت شهواتهم الدنيوية على طباعهم.ولأنَّ الطغيان قدر محتوم، فإنَّ هذه الشرائح لا تُترك بلا قانون يحكمها، وبذلك يرى فيلسوف المدينة الفاضلة أنَّ السلطة في جمهوريتة عبارة عن منظومة دائرية تكون فيها السلطة في كل حلقة منها فاعلة كمصدر من جهة وفاعلة في قابل من جهة أخرى.ومن أجلِّ ما وجدتِه في النظرية الأفلاطونية رؤيتها المثالية التحليلية الواقعية لطرحة الديموقراطية، فهي تعارضها وتراها أداة لشرعنة الاستبداد، وهذا ما أدعو لتأمله تأمُّلًا جادًّا.أنصح بقراءة هذا الكتاب قراءة موضوعية هادئة، فأفلاطون محطَّة ظلمتها دعاوى التعقل، وأقصتها شعارات الواقعية.
4840867991	3/5 ★★★☆☆Nothing against philosophy but this book really drained my mental faculties. It was challenging sometimes to grasp the slippery threads that Socrates wanted to weave inside his readers' heads, not because they were inherently complex but solely because of his method of going about things or reaching those conclusions. It took me 𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘢 𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦 to immerse myself in this dialogue between Socrates and his friends and even then, I was almost never of one mind with the direction in which the conversation was headed. 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙍𝙚𝙥𝙪𝙗𝙡𝙞𝙘 is said to be the longest of Plato's works and it sure felt like it. Segmented in 10 books, this dialogue/book seemed endless at the best of times and rambling at the worst. And that is saying something by someone who's read 𝘛𝘩𝘰𝘮𝘢𝘴 𝘔𝘰𝘳𝘦'𝘴 𝙐𝙩𝙤𝙥𝙞𝙖 and didn't find it half as challenging. Moving on. . . 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙨 -- Socrates, Glaucon, Adeimantus, Cephalus, Polemarchus and Thrasymachus. (Cephalus appears for a very short while in the introduction (Book 1), Polemarchus bows out at the end of the first argument, and Thrasymachus is forced to acquiesce from his stance at the matter of 𝘙𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘗𝘦𝘳𝘤𝘦𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘥 𝘑𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐𝘯𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘦 by the end of the first book, which is a shame because I quite agreed with Thrasymachus and was sad that he wasn't eloquent enough to defend his views against Socrates.) 𝙒𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 -- 2/5 ★★☆☆☆I only ever continued reading this book when I felt the most 𝙖𝙡𝙚𝙧𝙩 and/or 𝙖𝙬𝙖𝙠𝙚 and yet within a quarter of an hour, I was rendered useless to any intellectual thought and on the verge of a sleep that could be better termed a 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘢. If you think I'm exaggerating, please do yourself the favor of merely reading the first book let alone all ten. If I didn't have an audiobook to aid me on this extremely 𝘴𝘭𝘦𝘦𝘱-𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘪𝘯𝘨 journey, I doubt I'd ever have been able to finish. And DNFing Plato would truly have been a shame! 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙂𝙞𝙨𝙩 -- I, lucky for you, do not make a habit of expressing myself like the great Socrates and can cut to the chase and be direct about matters. Here goes:𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙄 -- What is Justice? Is it merely being honest, repaying debts and helping your friends and fellow countrymen? Or is there more to it? A lot of arguments that result in no real answers by the end of the first book. 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙄𝙄 -- What is the nature of the just and the unjust person? According to Socrates, the Just is happier and more virtuous than the Unjust, therefore making Justice both intrinsically and instrumentally valuable. Also, the stories in Greek mythology that paint the Greek Gods and Goddesses in a bad light are to be banned because they besmirch something that should remain pure and good. 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙄𝙄𝙄 -- What is the ideal form of education? What should be taught to the youth of the State and what should be banned? Again, a great many examples of Greek mythology stories are highlighted that are bad for the virtuous state of men and guardians of State. 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙄𝙑 -- What is the nature of justice in the State? Socrates states that their "𝘢𝘪𝘮 𝘪𝘯 𝘧𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘩𝘰𝘭𝘦;" and that needs to be the core value behind all decisions. 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙑 -- How to deal with "𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘯" in this Ideal state?To be blunt while speaking my mind, there were several instances in this Book that enraged me but I had to remind myself that this book. Was. Written. Centuries. Ago. *deep breaths*Here is Socrates' grand solution --- "... 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘰𝘯, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘳 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘯 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘰𝘯, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘯𝘰 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘥, 𝘯𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘥 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵.'I choose not to comment upon this whatsoever. The other major questions dealt with in this book were --- What is the nature of the true and the false philosopher? 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙑𝙄 -- Who should be the ruler or the guardian of the ideal state, i.e. the Republic?The answer being that... "𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘺 𝘣𝘦 𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘰𝘳 𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘣𝘺 𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘰𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘴."𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙑𝙄𝙄 -- How is a philosopher and/or guardian of the Republic meant to lead their fellow men from ignorance to enlightenment (true knowledge)? The nature of the cave allegory comes in here. 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙑𝙄𝙄𝙄 -- What is the nature of different types of governments and how do they degenerate? Socrates describes a series of regimes, ranging from the Ideal form of Government all the way down to the Tyrannical form and the causes that lead to it. 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙄𝙓 -- What is the nature of the tyrannical person and how does he/she come to be? Socrates believes the tyrannical person to be the most wretched and saddest of all human beings who is but a product of a corrupt and misguided education. 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙓 -- What is the nature of the afterlife and how does it relate to justice? Socrates is of the view that the Soul is immortal and will be judged by God upon death by degree of virtue. Therefore, justice ultimately leads to a content soul and a peaceful eternal afterlife and injustice leads to the opposite. 𝙁𝙡𝙖𝙬𝙨 (𝙞𝙛 𝙖𝙣𝙮) -- I understand that this book was written centuries ago and scholars/ academics/ philosophers back then had probably not heard of the modern art of 𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜. Because if they had, this book would be half the length it is in its present form. Seriously, someone should have taught Socrates and Plato the value of the art of saying more while speaking less. Oh and they did not need to constantly ban poets and artists from "their ideal Republic". Once was enough to get their point across. 𝙐𝙨𝙚𝙛𝙪𝙡 -- Reading this was useful in the way that my Philosophy friends can no longer win an argument simply based on my ignorance of 𝙋𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙤'𝙨 𝙍𝙚𝙥𝙪𝙗𝙡𝙞𝙘. And honestly, that's a 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. I cannot tell you how many times I lost a winning argument simply because I had no idea what this book was about or what it said about matters like Justice, politics, ethics, goodness, education, government, democracy, nature of human beings, the arts, poetry etc. Now, I know. Was some of it interesting, even a bit thought provoking? Sure. Was it life-altering? Nah. 𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙘𝙡𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣 -- You'd be fine by simply reading a good Introduction of this book rather than the entirety of the text. And if you're a neurotic perfectionist, then try an audiobook. And be prepared to fight to keep your eyes open and mind awake every step of the way.

1758268736	There is in every one of us, even those who seem to be most moderate, a type of desire that is terrible, wild, and lawless.So, it should be noted that I did not find this book at a bookstore and voluntarily buy it for my leisurely reading... It was on the syllabus for my political theory class. That being said, I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. Would I recommend it for a vacation? Absolutely not. Unless you like pondering about justice and censorship and the creations of rulers and cities... it's pretty dense material, but most of the fun in reading a book like this being able to discuss, debate and analyze the ideas and arguments Plato puts forth with a group of people. Maybe if I tried to read it by myself, I'd get bored or uninspired. But our class discussions (and syllabus) really kept me engrossed in the subject matter. I guess I'd recommend this book to a philosophy book club, if those exist.
2002494702	Sokrates ve çevresindeki birkaç kişi doğruluk - eğrilik üstüne konuşurken (doğrudan kasıt adalet bu arada) ilerleye ilerleye ideal devleti oluşturdukları bir diyaloga başlıyorlar. Kitapta zamansız bilgi olarak nitelendirilecek çok iyi tespitler var. Demek ki bazı şeyler hiç değişmiyor. Devlet'i oluştururlarken özellikle eğitim hakkındaki kısmını keyifle okudum. Bazen de diyalog okumaktan sıkıldım, kitabı yarım bırakıp sonra tekrar başladım. Yine de milattan önce yazılan bir eserin günümüze ışık tutması harika bir şey. Bunu düşünerek okursanız bazı sayfalarda vay be diyebiliyorsunuz. Felsefe okumalarına bilinçli bir şekilde yeni yeni başlayan biri olarak Devlet'i felsefeye giriş yapacaklara tavsiye ederim.
6372071382	So I've been on a philosophy kick lately, and I've realized that it is fruitful to read several works of philosophy in a row like this, because it helps you make connections between different thinkers and even eras in order to see the influences and developments of the form over time. And perhaps there is no philosopher more influential than Plato.I had recently read Hegel's "Philosophy of Right," for example, and could appreciate how his understanding of Plato informed his concept of the State. "The Republic" is perhaps where Plato's analysis of the ideal State is most concentrated.Now, if you are not already familiar with "The Republic," you may start reading this and think to yourself, "Wait! Socrates wrote this? I thought it was Plato!" Well that's because Plato conceived this as a dialogue between his mentor Socrates and a group of Athenians at a festival. The setup is that Socrates is hanging out drinking with some buddies and everyone starts pressing him with intellectual questions. Not cool! One Mardi Gras, I ended up hanging out with Trent Reznor on Magazine Street during the Thoth parade, and the last thing I wanted to do was aggravate him by talking shop when the guy is just trying to have a good time. Similarly, I would not have wanted HIM to start asking me questions about the mole on his back or whether his "friend" was on the right antidepressants. And certainly, neither of us were in any shape to engage in critical analysis of the nature of justice.But Socrates takes it in stride, because Socrates will do what Socrates does! And at every party, there's always some ass who is an obnoxious drunk. Enter Thrasymachus. I don't know what his problem was. Perhaps he had too much retsina or something, but he is flat out rude to Socrates and seems hell bent on busting his balls. It's actually quite fun reading how Socrates playfully dances around his insults and denegrates himself to to make Thrasymachus think that he is actually educating Socrates. In fact, if you get anything out of reading "The Republic," it will be how to avoid getting in a bar fight. Seriously, Plato's masterful depiction of the Socratic method is a prototype for what we psychiatrists use to deescalate dangerous situations and also for motivational interviewing. You essentially accept where a person is, then by asking them questions, you have them find their own answers and solutions. Now, the entire content of "The Republic" is pretty much entirely consistent with this kind of dialogue exchange. If I was at a party and some know-it-all was answering every question with a question, I'd be tempted to find some excuse to send him out on a run for more ice or cigarettes--anything to get him to stop with the incessant questions!At this party, though, there was no Pictionary or Twister, so everyone was perfectly content with playing with Socrates, so that this had to be the most intellectual party in history that didn't involve burning an effigy in front of the statue of some owl god. Topics were quite diverse, including the role of the philosopher and the poet in society. This is where we get Allegory of the Cave, which explains Plato's theory of forms. And being that this was a party, of course the conversation steered to topics like love. But what this book is most known for is its analysis of what the ultimate city-state would look like, concluding with the depiction of the idealized utopia Kallipolis, ruled by philosopher-kings.Sometimes Plato seems to get a little carried away when building his ideal State. He appears to love censorship, at least among the warrior class, who he calls "guardians," though I think he really meant that term to represent bureaucracy, or the ruling class that has put aside personal feelings for the good of the state. Poetry must follow strict standards to uphold virtues. So poems would not be allowed that depicted heroes being scared of death. And music would equally be required to be uplifting, decent, and military. For some reason, that equates to only lyres and harps being allowed in the City. Flutes would only be okay if they were played by solo shepherds in the fields where nobody could hear them. Geez! What about triangles? I love the triangle! He even goes so far as to say that the Dorian and Phrygian are the only decent musical harmonies, and that the Lydian scale, which is "soft and relaxed," should be banished. But that's my favorite scale! Well, I guess I kind of understand not wanting my entire police force spending all their time putting tears in their beers, but c'mon, Plato! Lighten up!Therein lies my main problem with "The Republic". It doesn't seem like a utopia to me, but rather totalitarian. Though Socrates believed in social mobility, and that all people are brothers and sisters, Plato has him advocating for strict class systems each doing their particular part for the health of the State organism. Any kind of dishonesty would be strictly punished, except of course for the ruling class, who are allowed to lie if it is for the benefit of the State. And chronically ill people who cannot fulfill the obligations of their occupation should not be kept alive by physicians, because they are of no use to the State and thus should be removed from the gene pool lest they live on to breed sickly kids. And so on and so forth.Some scholars have claimed that Plato was trying to be ironic here, but even if that was the case, it is apparent that Plato's tendencies have infiltrated political thought throughout the centuries, at least among elites who think they know better getting together at conferences and think-tanks and having these very kinds of discussions. Supposedly, Plato's depiction of Socrates and his teachings are not representative of his old teacher, who was much more humanitarian.So no, I would not want to live in Plato's Republic, but perhaps Socrates himself really was a genuinely nice guy, the kind I would gladly have over at my place for a drink any day. Minus the hemlock, of couse. But you'll just have to check it out for yourself to see what you think. Even if you weren't already assigned it in school, I still say it's required reading.SCORE: 4 philosopher-kings out of 5WORD OF THE DAY: Valetudinarian
3883263836	I was surfing Netflix the other night, and decided on watching something that'll make me laugh. I came across John Wick with Keanu Reaves. And then I remembered he made Bill and Ted, so I watched that instead. And one of the historical figures Bill and Ted grabbed from history was Socrates, the Greek philosopher. I remember reading The Republic by Plato back when I was a student in the university. It was very interesting considering the different political regimes (tyranny, democracy...). It helped to understand how a regime was fair or not. Not only did I find it intellectually stimulating (which I prized more than anything else), it also opened my eyes to the realm of philosophy and I've been hooked ever since. I learned about Socrates through the words of Plato, about an exemplar thinker and teacher, and about the importance of applying clear thought to problems, and to resist oppression regardless of the cost. Some of it was difficult to read (thinking about it now, make that a lot was difficult to read), but the dialogues could be very lively. It painted portraits of different characters arguing over heartfelt positions, and slow-minded aggression constantly deflected with quick-minded wit. It argued for roles and institutions of governance that protected the weak from tyranny and might. In that sense it was a very universal story with Socrates as a (somewhat) traditional Hero. It is a dialog in which Socrates outlined his vision of an ideal society. Since western civilization's roots stem from ancient Greece, the writings of great thinkers like Plato and another one, Aristotle, are invaluable insights for anyone who is curious why the world exists at it does today.In terms of The Republic's story, I have to say that there wasn't much of a narrative. Although it was written in the form of a dialogue, somewhat like a play. It is more of a philosophical text than a story, but there are certainly narrative elements. For example, Plato's famous metaphor of the cave involved the progression of a hypothetical character, but was not meant to be dramatically compelling. Rather it was to illustrate Plato's point. The Republic isn't so much a story as it is a dialog. Imagine being in a room with a handful of brilliant people. What would the conversation sound like? That's what The Republic is. Socrates was the leading thinker who had a vision of an ideal society, and his friends asked loaded questions for clarity.Look at all the problems in the world today and you can see that very few are genuinely "new." Things like poverty, corruption, crime, environmental destruction, and general malaise date back thousands of years. In this book, Plato offered his thoughts, along with a good many philosophical thought experiments, which in turn stimulated your own thinking. He certainly don't have all the answers, but he painted a wondrously bizarre picture in the process of getting to his conclusions. And best of all, his arguments and reasoning beg you to think them through and figure out where he went astray so you can come up with your own ideas.In addition, the book's legacy is enormous, virtually every paradigm devised since its writing has been influenced by it. Ideas about what a State can and shouldn't be allowed to do, how to educate the people, how culture is preserved and passed on, how culture and politics influenced the individual's character and motivations, whether "might is right" (i.e. survival of the fittest) applied to people and whether it ought to, etc. can be found in this book. To learn and understand more about the world today, I find it extremely useful to look back at books I read like classics such as The Republic and discover where today's ideas came from.Looking back I really liked Plato's writing. In The Republic he started off with a group of friends just sitting around waiting for a festival to start and their conversation just picked up and carried them away. The bulk of the book is in the form of a dialogue, albeit a very one-sided one. It's fun to see how one topic grew and developed into another just through the characters' discussion, and some of the developments are just so farfetched and ridiculous you can't help but laugh.

1475459593	جمهور افلاطون ده کتابه و انقدر طولانیه که نمیشه یک نظر مشخص و معلوم در مورد کلش داد. شاید بهتر باشه آدم در مورد کتاب بکتابش نظر بده. اما بهرحال،جمهور رو من بزبان اصلی‌ش نخوندم، ترجمه‌ش بانگلیسیرو خوندم و فکر نمیکنم درست باشه هیچ نظری در مورد نثرش بدم. در موردش بیشتر ازینها حرف زده‌ند و نمیدونم چی هست که من ادبیاتی بتونم درمورد این کتاب که از امهات فلسفه‌ست اضافه کنم. اما چند چیز که همینطوری بنظرم اومد یکی این بود که این دیالوگ بیشتر از حداقل بقیه دیالوگها دیالوگ نیست و خیلی کم گفتگو درش دیده میشه. سقراط حرف میزنه و راهنمایی میکنه و طرف دیگه تایید میکنه یا تعجب میکنه یا ازش میخواد بیشتر توضیح بده. فکر میکنم بجز مورد تراسیماخوس کسی چندان وارد دیالوگ باون معنی نمیشه و طرف مقابل پنکه‌ایه که ورقهای بله و البته و همینطوره رو هرازگاهی پرت میکنه رو میز. ولی بهرحال شکل گرافیکی دیالوگرو داره. در جمهور مسائل متنوعی مطرح میشند، از رژیم غذایی و تربیت بچها گرفته تا عدالت و انواع کاراکترها. و باز مثل بقیه دیالوگهای افلاطون اون چندتایی که خونده‌م چیزیکه منرو وحشتزده میکنه اینه که این حرفها با این همه دقت و فکر که روشون شده‌ قبل از میلاد مسیح زده شده‌ند (حیرتا) و طرفه اینکه البته بعضی حرفهاش بعد از اینهمه سال بنظر خام میاد، مثلا تقسیم‌بندی تیپ‌های شخصیتی‌ش اما چیزهایی هم داره که هنوز قابل استفاده‌ند و مثلا من خودم باهاشون همداستانم؛ مثل حرفهایی که در مذمت پولداری میزنه یا برخوردی که در مواجهه با بلاها توصیه میکنه اعتقادات من در عصر اینترنت هم هستند. و چیز دیگری که بهش فکر میکنم اینه که اگه افلاطون با این جزئیات و جدیت در مورد این همه چیز حرف زده واقعا بشر از اون موقع تا الان چی کار میکرده و چه دستاوردی داره. طبیعیش این بود که با گذشت این همه سال نشه دیگه اینهارو خوند و بنظر مهملات ساده‌انگارانه بیاند اما حقیقت چیز دیگه‌ایه. بخشهایی ازین کتاب خیلی خسته‌کننده‌ند و تک‌صدایی‌ش خیلی وقتها دلرو میزنه، اما بخشهایی هم داره که بسیار جالب و گاهی سرگرم‌کننده‌ند و بنظرم کلا کتابیه که بخوندنش میرزه.
3573170500	Quite gripping – especially for a text so old. It almost seems that the Prussian State and the Third Reich used this as a blueprint. Moreover, the regress from aristocracy to timocracy to oligarchy to democracy and finally to tyranny – along with their typical men - does not sound very promising for the current democracies that want to “progress” into something else. This is also the typical project and call for political action that got Plato and other “philosopher kings” into all kinds of trouble since then.The theory of truth – along with the cave allegory - is a masterpiece. Truth for Plato goes hand in hand with being – and does not have much in common with what we call (propositional) truth these days. The philosopher – as opposed to the sophist, the common people, and the rest – is the only one who gets a glimpse of the truth; while truth in turn is connected with Being, Good, God, immortality, eternal soul, reincarnation, ideas, essences, and so on. And while talking of the ideas – God created them and, for example, the carpenter follows the idea of bed to create beds; while the painter who paints beds should be kicked out of the state - and similar for the poets and other imitation arts.
3896618105	I finished the first book of the republic (there are 10 in total). And it was much harder work then the previous dialogues I read and much harder then what I remembered when I read it for the first time, many years ago.I can only recommend to read it in a translation which provides ample notes. Like the one by Allan Bloom. This translation goes in the meaning of the original words which is important because key words are determined by the context and time when they were written and the original Greek words have some extra connotations.The Republic of PlatoFurthermore consider using the guide: Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Plato and the Republic. This one is great because it gives a chapter by chapter explanation. So it is ideal for reconsidering the chapter after the lecture and is also better retained.Most companion provide general explanations about the themes pertaining to the book. This can be interesting additionally but less essential then the guide I mentioned above. An example of such a theme companion is The Cambridge Companion to Plato's Republic

2470759	No book has influenced my life more than Plato's Republic. It admittedly can be a difficult read: it is almost entirely a back and forth conversation between two people, Socrates and Glaucon, discussing the nature of man, the soul, justice, and what the most just society, or Republic, would look like. In this highly utopian account, Socrates expresses little hope in the common man, and instead suggests authoritarian rule, by philosophers, would lead to the most just state. His contempt for democracy can be disturbing to those who have faith in the said system, however, it behooves all to read. Forget trying to become enlightened by some eastern religion, the morals, lessons and philosophy of this cornerstone of Westernism will strike you as remarkably fresh and increasingly relevant today, some 2,500 years after it was written.
4248928961	Glaucon: The greatest yes-man of human history.Indeed, I now see how this was such an influential text. It is quite comprehensive in breadth by addressing, well, almost everything about society. Given the context, specific topics addressed which surprised me were feminism, eugenics (alluded to), socialism (also alluded to), and aspects of arts. Also, the famous Socratic dialogue was interesting to finally observe in action. Though, this is not to forget the numerous issues in both content and presentation which philosophers ended up critiquing and debating about for centuries.On the whole, there was little particularly noteworthy for me personally given my background and context. However, reading this did provide THE essential context for subsequent philosophical works.
2388134437	It is widely believed that The Republic by Plato is essential reading for anybody who takes philosophy seriously, and now I understand why. Its dialogues set the tone for all subsequent Western philosophy and made an honest search for the truth seem cool (at least for me). As in many of Plato’s works, Socrates is the protagonist. He’s the one who goes up to everybody and starts arguments, asking many questions and pointing out inconsistencies. Some people give him a hard time, but I have a huge amount of admiration for his legacy; I wish I could go back in time and philosophize with him. More people should look to Socrates and use debate for truth-seeking rather than just winning arguments. When you find the truth, both sides win. Part I starts with Socrates leading a debate with several other men on what the definitions of justice and injustice are. Everybody has slightly different ideas, but Socrates is able to persuade everyone but Thrasymachus, who believes that justice is the interest of the stronger. Part II continues their debate about justice, with Thrasymachus arguing that individuals benefit from unjust acts, and Socrates claiming that society as a whole benefits from justice. This is the closest thing that I’ve seen to a heated debate in Socratic dialogues.Part III is concerned with education. The Republic was written in 380 B.C., before the time of Christ, and much of their theology was derived from ancient Greek poets like Homer. Their discussion was about what types of poetry young people should be exposed to. They agreed that it should express courage and strength, rather than the “woe is me” type poetry that might encourage weakness. I believe this is also the section where they discussed music theory and which modes were proper. I learned all the modes on guitar when I was younger, and I still use them. Each mode has its own personality, as Plato describes. They also agreed that males and females should receive the same education, which is fascinating considering how many societies throughout history have been patriarchal.In Parts IV and V, they discuss how the members of society will be happy in filling their appropriate roles, whether it be leader or auxiliary. They should have specialized jobs so that they can become experts in their fields and more efficient. There will be no “jack-of-all-trades” in this society. It may be hard to live up to this ideal, but Plato’s goal seems to be justice and equality. Part VI discusses the family. Women can have the same jobs as men, as long as it is fitting. But the family must be abolished, so that everyone will treat each other the same, without preferential treatment. Also, this will help the State to breed ideal citizens.Part VII deals with the famous “Allegory of the Cave” which compares ignorance to seeing shadows on the wall of a cave, rather than seeing the actual objects. The “philosopher king” must be brought up to be able to see the actual objects and not just the shadows. Part VIII, my favorite section, discusses the four unjust constitutions. They are timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. He believes that the philosopher king is superior to any of these forms of government. I enjoyed this section because of how it relates to today’s governments. Part IX is where everything starts to come full circle as we approach our conclusion. He points out how because the tyrannical man has so much inner conflict, his selfishness cannot make him happier than the philosopher king. It is virtue in itself that makes the philosopher happy. In this, he is taking one more jab at Thrasymachus’s argument. Part X is a bizarre detour into how poetry doesn’t help society. I disagree with this section, but I guess it's just a product of its time. Part XI is a beautiful conclusion discussing reincarnation and how people get to choose their next life after they die. The Republic was an amazing book and an inspiration.I'm so jealous of Bill and Ted!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvYRq...
229426407	و أفتخر أنّني حاورت أفلاطون أسبوعاً كاملاً !
5565082043	Die Politeia oder How to Mäßigung?!1. Komplett ohne Vorwissen, ist es nicht ratsam die Politeia zu lesen.Ich möchte gerade philosophische Werke möglichst unvoreingenommen entdecken und vermeide es, zuvor zu recherchieren. Das war in Bezug auf die Ideenlehre unklug. Informieren, wer diesbezüglich (wie ich) noch in der Höhle schlummert! Da ich auf die Politeia aufgrund der Lektüre von Aristipp und einige seiner Zeitgenossen: Roman gestoßen bin, die im letzten Buch Wielands, Gegenstand der Briefe ist, war ich schon leicht im antiken Verständnisuniversum angekommen. Auch das halte ich für das Ergründen der Politeia unerlässlich. Wie waren die antiken gesellschaftlichen Strukturen? Welche Regierungsform wurde präferiert? Welche spezifischen Charakteristika sind zu beobachten? Welches Verhältnis hatte man zur Polis? etc. 2. Sucht Euch ne Übersetzung, die ihr versteht!Zuerst hab ich es mit der Übersetzung von Karl Prantl versucht, die für mich als "Dummy" zu kompliziert war. Sehr geschwollen und verworren. Keine Chance dem Inhalt zu folgen. Danach hab ich die Übersetzung des AtheneMedia-Verlages von Andre Hoffmann getestet. Wahrscheinlich ist die so manchem zu einfach und flapsig. Mit 388 Seiten kann es auch durchaus sein, das da etwas gekürzt war? Allerdings hat diese Übersetzung mir einen riesen Spass bereitet, da die teils doch komödiantische Art der Dialoge besonders gut zum Tragen kam. Die Politeia ist ambivalent - auf sämtlichen Ebenen.Sie ist:• sperrig und dröge - frisch und unterhaltsam,• hilfloser Unsinn - scharfsinnig weitsichtig,• Grenzziehend, stark Hierachisierend in den Begriffen, nach einem Entweder-Oder-Prinzip und dann wieder völlig schwammig, lose, ungenau. Spielwiese für Interpretationswütige. • eine Utopie, die in bester Absicht im Sinne von Gut und Gerecht verfasst wurde und furchtbar totalitär daherkommt.Ein Beispiel für die Ambivalenz: An sich wird der Altruismus in den Vordergrund gestellt - komplette Selbstaufgabe und das Aufgehen in der Polis. Allerdings finden wir in Buch 6 folgende Stelle zu den Philosophen, in der ganz klar Selbstfürsorge an erster Stelle steht - "hilf zuerst Dir selbst, bevor Du anderen helfen kannst": "und da er nun sieht, dass er weder dem Staat Noch seinen Freunden nützen würde und bedenkt dass er sein Leben wegwerfen müsste, ohne sich selbst oder anderen etwas Gutes zu tun, schweigt er und geht seinen eigenen Weg. Er gleicht einem Menschen, der sich bei einem Sturm von Staub und Graupel, den der Wind vor sich her treibt, in den Schutz einer Mauer zurückzieht; und da er die übrige Menschheit voller Bosheit sieht, ist er zufrieden, wenn er nur sein eigenes Leben leben und von Bösem oder Unrecht rein sein kann, und in Frieden und gutem Willen mit heiterer Hoffnung abreist. Ja, sagte er, und er wird ein großes Werk vollbracht haben, bevor er abreist.Ein großes Werk ‒ ja, aber nicht das größte, es sei denn, er findet einen Staat, der zu ihm passt; denn in einem Staat, der zu ihm passt, wird er ein größeres Wachstum haben und der Retter seines Landes wie auch seiner selbst sein."Ein Beispiel für klare Grenzziehung, die danach wieder zu Brei verarbeitet wird:"Diejenigen die Weisheit und Tugend nicht kennen und immer mit Völlerei und Sinnlichkeit beschäftigt sind, gehen hinunter und wieder hinauf bis zum Mittelmaß, sie gehen nie in die Wahre sinnliche Welt. Ihre Freuden sind mit Schmerzen vermischt, wie könnten sie anders sein. Denn sie sind nur Schatten und Bilder des Wahren und werden durch den Kontrast gefärbt, der sowohl Licht als auch Schatten übertreibt und so pflanzen sie in den Köpfen der Narren wahnsinnige Wünsche von sich selbst ein. Vorher wurde bereits auf Gewürze eigegangen : "Und das Verlangen, das darüber hinaus geht, nach delikateren Speisen oder anderen Genüssen, die man im Allgemeinen loswerden könnte, wenn man sie in der Jugend beherrscht und trainiert, und die dem Körper schaden und der Seele beim Streben nach Weisheit und Tugend schaden, kann man mit Recht als unnötig bezeichnen" Genießen, lecker Essen = nicht gut, wollen wir nicht!Und dann folgt dieser Satz: Wer Vergnügungen unter der Leitung und in der Gesellschaft der Vernunft und des Wissens sucht, und den Vergnügungen, die ihnen die Weisheit zeigt, nachgehen und sie gewinnen, auch die wahrsten Vergnügungen in dem höchsten Grad haben werden, der ihnen erreichbar ist, insofern sie der Wahrheit folgen. Also jetzt doch lecker Essen wenn wenn mich Vernunft und Weisheit begleiten?! Entscheid dich mal!Die Politeia ist eine Inspirationsquelle des neuen Testamentes. Da ich viele Jahre meines Lebens sehr intensiv mit der Bibel lebte, sind mir Formulierungen en masse im Gedächtnis, weshalb das Lesen der Politeia wie tennisballgroße Einschläge von Hagelkörnern im hintersten Winkel meiner Erinnerung waren. Ich bin ja schon fast geneigt das neue Testament als Plagiat zu bezeichnen 😬2 Beispiele:Buch II der Politeia:"Das Laster ist in Hülle und Fülle ohne Mühe zu haben, der Weg ist eben und ihre Wohnung ist nahe. Doch vor die Tugend haben die Götter Mühsal gesetzt."Matthäus 7 Vers 13/14: "Gehet ein durch die enge Pforte. Denn die Pforte ist weit, und der Weg ist breit, der zur Verdammnis abführt; und ihrer sind viele, die darauf wandeln. 14Und die Pforte ist eng, und der Weg ist schmal, der zum Leben führt; und wenige sind ihrer, die ihn finden."Buch 10 Politeia: "der wahre Läufer kommt ans Ziel und wird gekrönt. So ist es auch mit dem Gerechten. Wer bis zum Ende jeder Handlung und jeder Gelegenheit seines ganzen Lebens durchhält, hat ein gutes Zeugnis und trägt den Preis davon, den die Menschen zu vergeben haben"Timotheus 4,7-8, Apostel Paulus: "Ich habe den guten Kampf gekämpft, ich habe den Lauf vollendet, ich habe den Glauben gehalten; hinfort liegt für mich bereit die Krone der Gerechtigkeit, die mir der Herr, der gerechte Richter, an jenem Tag geben wird."Das vielköpfige Ungeheuer aus Buch 9 der Politeia, erinnert stark an den vielköpfigen Drachen aus der Offenbarung.Die Katholische Kirche hat sich hiervon aus Buch 2 inspirieren lassen: "wenn die Dichter wahrhaftig sprechen, dann sollten wir besser ungerecht sein und von den Früchten der Ungerechtigkeit opfern, denn wenn wir gerecht sind, werden wir zwar der Rache des Himmels entgehen, aber den Gewinn der Ungerechten verlieren, wenn wir aber ungerecht sind, werden wir den Gewinn behalten, und indem wir sündigen und beten und beten und sündigen, werden die Götter besänftigt und wir werden nicht bestraft... nach dem Tod bei Göttern schlecht abschneiden" Das, was man heute als regressiven, konservativen Menschen bezeichnet, der sich im Schutz der eigenen Kultur, in nationalistische Grenzen einbunkern will, liefert uns Plato auf dem Silbertablett: keine fremde Kultur von außen, keine komische Musik, die die Leute auf dumme Gedanken bringen solle, so wenig Veränderung von Außen wie möglich. Alles was "dem Körper schaden und der Seele beim Streben nach Weisheit und Tugend schaden [zufügt], kann man mit Recht als unnötig bezeichnen."Ist im Kontext der griechischen Polis völlig verständlich. Man hat sich mit Leib und Seele seiner Polis verschrieben. Alles was außerhalb war, war Feindesland ( es sei denn mit Dir war gut zu Handeln - Ambivalenz! Gastfreundschaft war ganz groß geschrieben). Desweiteren stolpert man über ZENSUR - Buch 2 "Kriege und Ränke der Götter, Jungen und Unbedachten nicht leichtfertig gewisse Geschichten erzählen, besser in Stille begraben, einige wenige in Mysterium hören, ein junger Mensch kann nicht beurteilen was allegorisch ist und was nicht."Buch3: "Angst vor dem Tod nehmen: Alles aus der Unterwelt das Angst macht streichenLüge nur als Medizin , sollte Ärzten vorbehalten sein - Privileg der Lüge nur die Regierenden des Staates - zum Wohle der Allgemeinheit Lügen""Gesetz erlassen, das verbietet zu sagen Gott ist böse.... Kunst und Natur, was gut geschaffen ist, am wenigsten anfällig für Veränderung von außen."Plädoyer für bestimmte Dichter und Musiker , die keinen Aufruhr verbreiten. EUGENIK - Züchtungsträume: "so selten wie möglich Minderwertige vereinigen - Herde in erstklassigem Zustand erhalten. Herrscher bestimmt Anzahl der Hochzeiten, steuern, wer wem zugeführt. "Auch "nett" und später von den Sozialisten umgesetzt: Wie werden Philosophenkönige eigene Stadt in Ordnung bringen? Kinder unter 10 in Besitz nehmen und in eigenen Gewohnheiten und Gesetzen erziehen."Soweit, so gruselig.Jetzt kommen meine Lieblingsstellen!Buch 1: "Gleich und Gleich gesellt sich gern":"Da jammern die Meisten von uns wenn wir zusammen sind, indem sie nach in der Jugend genossenen Vergnügungen Verlangen haben, zurückerinnern als wären sie großer Dinge beraubt und als wäre es damals ein gutes Leben gewesen und jetzt nicht einmal mehr ein Leben.Sophokles: keine Begierde im Alter, bin froh von vielen rasenden Gebietern los zu sein. Feminismus! Buch 4: "Die einfachen, gemäßigten Begierden, die der Vernunft folgen und von Verstand und wahrer Meinung geleitet werden, sind nur bei wenigen zu finden und zwar bei den besten Geborenen und gebildeten" ---Frauen gehören nicht dazu!---Buch 5: "...um zu einer richtigen Schlussfolgerung über den Besitz und Nutzung von Frauen und Kindern zu gelangen...dass Männer die Hüter und Wächter der Herde sein sollen."Sorgen sich, dass alte nackte Frauen bei Gymnastikübungen nicht schön aussehen. Gnhihihi.... Ästhetik hatte nun mal DEN Stellenwert in der Antike. "Frauen und Männer unterscheiden sich nur in ihrer relativen Stärke oder Schwäche." Was für ein Zugeständnis!Frauen dürfen zu Wächtern ausgebildet werden! Das ist unheimlich progressiv, wenn einem klar ist, wie wertlos Frauen in der Antike waren. Selbst für die Erotik waren Penisse favorisiert. Buch 8-10 sind der Oberknaller. Da hätte ich so viele geniale Zitate, bei denen man aufschreien will, so genau beschreibt er Dinge, die in der Jetztzeit zu finden sind. Wenigstens die Kapitel lesen, wenn man sich nicht das ganze Buch antun will!SOGAR das Prinzip der Überdynamisierung greift er auf. Grüße an Das Ende der Illusionen: Politik, Ökonomie und Kultur in der Spätmoderne gehen raus :-)"Kannst Du dich dann wundern, dass Menschen, die in der Wahrheit unerfahren sind, so wie sie über viele andere Dinge falsche Vorstellungen haben, auch falsche Vorstellungen über Lust und Schmerz und den Zwischenzustand haben; so dass sie, wenn sie nur zum schmerzhaften hingezogen, Schmerz empfinden und den Schmerz, den sie empfinden, für echt halten und ebenso wenn sie vom Schmerz zum neutralen oder Zwischenzustand hingezogen werden, fest glauben, das Ziel der Sättigung und des Vergnügens erreicht zu haben, sie die das Vergnügen nicht kennen, irren, wenn sie den Schmerz mit der Abwesenheit des Schmerzes vergleichen, was so ist, als ob man Schwarz mit Grau statt mit Weiß vergleichen würde."Platos Debattenbeitrag zur Krise der Literatur oder dem Hollywoodverständnis von Wissenschaftlern: "Ebenso kann man sagen, dass der Dichter mit seinen Worten und Sätzen die Farben der verschiedenen Künste auflegt, wobei er selbst ihre Natur nur so weit versteht, dass er sie nachahmt, und andere Leute die so unwissend sind wie er und nur nach seinen Worten urteilen, stellen sich vor, dass er, wenn er vom Schustern oder militärischer Taktik oder irgendetwas anderem spricht, sehr gut spricht - so süß ist der Einfluss, den Melodie und Rhythmus von Natur aus haben. Und ich denke, Sie werden immer wieder festgestellt haben, wie armselig die Erzählungen der Dichter aussehen, wenn man sie der Farben beraubt, die die Musik ihnen verleiht, und sie in einfacher Prosa vorträgt. Sie sind wie Gesichter, die nie wirklich schön waren, sondern nur blühten; und nun ist die Blüte der Jugend von ihnen gewichen. " Reicht erst mal 😆Den Großen Bogen der Ideenlehre und das Geplapper über das Schöne, Gute, die unsterbliche Seele, was die Schicksalsgöttinnen noch damit zu tun haben, wie Meinung, zu Wissen und Unwissen steht und vieles mehr, müsst Ihr woanders nachlesen. Fazit: hartes Buch, das Ambiguitätstoleranz trainiert und selbst einen Unsterblichkeitsstatus erlangt hat, wenn man überlegt WER sich so alles hat davon inspirieren lassen und uns derbe Pfeiler in die Geschichte gerammt hat. Hier hat einer so vieles schon vorgedacht. WIESO? WIESO Gesellschaft, WIESO Politik....!?Erster Kommentar: Oh man, ich bin echt ne Heldin 🫢, vor lauter Spurensuche von Plagiaten der Bibelschreiberlinge nicht gerafft, dass die Ideenlehre das ganze Buch durchzieht. Wer die letzten Updates gesehen hat, und dessen Seele voller Wissen aufgeladen ist, wird sich köstlich ob meiner Dummheit amüsiert haben. Na mal sehen, ob ich mich noch nach oben graben kann. Erst mal Material sichten, denken, schlafen und dann kommt ne Bewertung dieses Abenteuers. Ich war in meinem Leben noch nie so dermaßen geistig erschöpft wie nach diesem Buch. Völlig neue Erfahrung.
429938364	Plato's The Republic is one of the more widely read works of philosophy of all time. It is a complex work, one that rambles due to the nature of it being a dialogue rather than a pure expository piece, but one with some interesting and applicable ideas within it nonetheless.The core argument that Plato makes, through using Socrates as the voice of reason, seems to link up to the idea of the creation of a better Republic - hence the title - or a kind of Utopia. He argues that in the end the things that most people pursue in life - wealth, fame, power etc. - are not as important as philosophy - or in other words the knowledge of what to do with wealth, fame and power. He, therefore, upholds justice and rationality over such things. One of Plato's biggest claims is that a true king should be a Philosopher (or if I remember I think he even mention poet, given that he seems to argue that philosophy and poetry are not dissimilar) King. A King who does not crave leadership for its own merit, but for the good that he can do for others. But it wasn't the big claims that stuck with me as much as a pointed little side-comment that attacking smaller issues is like attacking a hydra.The reason this comment stuck with me is because of my friends. I have plenty of friends who like to think that they are doing some good (myself included) by attacking every little small issue that comes along to do with injustice or animal cruelty or whatever. I'm not disagreeing that these are important issues, I merely agree with Plato that concentrating on one smaller issue is like cutting the head from a hydra - another related head grows back alongside the same head. The point is not to attack the smaller head, but to attack the bigger issue - the core issue (if it is a negative issue) and see what can be done to change things truly.As for who should read a work like this? I believe that everyone should read at least snippets or a summary in the course of their lifetime. It may not agree with your own worldview, but there are ideas that you can take away nonetheless. I for one agree with his points about what is truly important is not the physical things, but the merits and uses of such physical things.
3942151168	He might’ve taken a radical approach to establish his rules, it's not really practical, but there are good things to say about the book.From deceitful rendering of reality in art that (unawarely) influence our life decisions ,to caring about our neighbors’ distress as if it was our own finger who got hurt and the pain began to spread itself on every part of my body. To everyone making sure the elements of their soul are in harmony (that is, they are everyday acting to a goal compatible what themselves)- we are aware of it when we get depressed from doing/following a path so unlike ourselves I can’t deny that the first task of each human is to keep harmony with every elements of their soul; I can’t deny that it’s only when this will happen for each human that the harmony of the State will also prevail- because what is a State constituted of humans.. just like a human is constituted of the elements of its soul. That being unsatisfied with our natural needs is what arouses countless wars (micro and macro)that the educators are making the world exceedingly more perverse, carelessly praising immoral acts disguised as « freedom of speech »; And someone or something need to find a way to handle the propagation of these virus for future generations… Good education upon everyone was his solution (that is, education that is leading towards that state of harmony with everyone in the state)- but the philosopher king is too radical of a way to establish and it will instill conflict between the people.

861561763	What do you mean by x, y and z?If you stop people in the street and show them how little thought they've put into their own understanding of the world, I can see why people would be angry and you'd end up on trial. Socrates was the renowned for doing it, he made people feel stupid and the state ordered him to the choose between renouncing his beliefs or drinking the cup of hemlock. He chose death.Luckily, Plato recorded his method and in this book the people who engage in Socratic dialogue are much more interested in gaining knowledge than appearing to be the masters of it. 450 pages of pure dialogue can be at times repetitive and I'm not really a fan of generalization, but overall, I found this book useful and enjoyable even now, approx. 2400 years after it was written.
2253233852	Bu yılki ilk kitap okuma hedefim bazı belli başlı klasikleri okumak. İşe Platon'un Devlet'i ile başladım. Okuduktan sonra insan 2 bin küsür yıllık bir eserin değeri bir daha anlaşılıyor. Platon burada hayali ve ütopya bir devlet kuruyor. Doğru nedir, eğri nedir, doğru insan hep mutsuz mu, eğri insanın yaptığı kötülük yanına kâr kalır ve mutlu mu olur gibi sorulardan yola çıkarak eğiliği ve doğruluğu tartabilecekleri bir devlet fikri kurarlar.Ayrıntılı inceleme ve kitap özeti için: http://kitapokurum.blogspot.com/2018/...
4899532972	Devlet, Platon'un Sokratik-Diyalektik metodla 'ideal devlet'i, ama esasında 'doğruyu' ve doğru insanı aradığı; ihtiva ettiği fikirlerle ise yüzyıllar boyunca Batıda ve Doğuda yüzlerce medeniyeti ve düşünürü temelden etkilemiş; felsefenin ve siyaset teorisinin ilk büyük ve en önemli eserini oluşturuyor. Fakat eseri daha iyi özümseyebilmek için kanımca önce Platon'un felsefesini anlamak gerekiyor.Platon'a göre, sürekli bir değişim ve oluşum içinde olan bir maddi evren olduğu kadar bir de öncesi ve sonu olmayan bir 'idealar evreni' bulunuyor. Platon, canlı ve cansız bütün varlıkların, duyularımızla algılayabildiğimiz şeylerin tümünün işte bu hiç değişmeyen ve hep var olan asıl hallerinin, yani 'idea'larının birer yansımasından başka birşey olmadığını savunuyor. Böylece gelip geçici maddi ilkelerden ziyade, asıl manevi ilkelerin var ve kalıcı olduğunu ortaya atarak ilk defa 'idealizm'i kuruyor. Devlet ise onun bu felsefesini mükemmel bir şekilde yansıtıyor, çünkü Platon arzuladığı devleti bu idealardan meydana getiriyor. Eserde Platon'un böylesi bir devletin henüz var olmamış olmasının hiç var olmayacağı anlamına gelmediğine, akıl süzgecinden geçtiği için her durumda onun en doğru devlet olacağına devamlı vurgu yaptığını görüyoruz.Böylece eserine başlarken birincil amacı doğruyu eğriden ayırmak ve ona ulaşmak olan Platon, işe insandan değil, devletten başlıyor. Çünkü devleti insandan ayrı bir yapı olarak değil; toplu halde yaşamak zorunda olan insanların bir araya gelmesinin doğal sonucu olarak ortaya çıkan insansı bir organizma olarak görüyor. Dolayısıyla daha büyük bir organizma olan devlette, iyinin de kötünün de daha kolayca görülebileceğini ve bunun da insana kolaylıkla uygulanabileceğini düşünüyor. Mesela, Platon'a göre insan ruhu nasıl üç birimden oluşuyorsa (akıl, coşku, arzu) devletin de üç ayrı birimi bulunuyor. (yöneticiler, muhafızlar, halk) Ayrıca nasıl 'doğru' bir insanda bu birimler dengede olursa, adil bir devlette de bunların mutlak surette ölçülü olması gerekiyor.İlk bölümlerde toplumun bu üç bölümünün ikisinin (halkın ve muhafızların) doğalarına göre nasıl tasnif edilmesi ve eğitilmesi gerektiğini okuyoruz. Eğitimin ve düşüncenin en büyük yasa olduğu, eşitlikçi olmayan (buna inanmayan) fakat adil olan; bu anlamda kesinlikle özgürlükçü değil fakat doğrunun ve aklın yolunda giden 'kontrolcu' bir devlet yaratıyor Platon. Ünlü 'mağara alegorisini' içeren daha sonraki bölümlerde ise, 'filozof'un kim olduğunu ve neden devlet yönetiminin ona verilmesi gerekliliğini okuyoruz. Platon'a göre filozof az önce bahsettiğimiz cismel varlıkların ötesini görebilen, yani onların idealarına vakıf olan, kısacası 'iyi'yi bilen kişiye deniyor. İşte bu sebeple yöneticinin ya da yöneticilerin maddiyata, bayağı şeylere tok, yalnız hakikate aç olan bu kimseler olması gerekiyor. Burada da Platon'un halkın çok küçük kesimini oluşturan bu yöneticilerin yaşama şekillerini kesin sınırlarla belirlediğini görüyoruz.Son bölümlerde ise Platon farklı yönetim biçimlerini tartışıp, bunların iyiden kötüye sıralamasını yapıyor. Burada Demokrasiyi, en kötü yönetim biçimi olan Tiranlıktan hemen önceye koyarken, onun görünüşte hoş olan ama insan tabiatına aykırı ve kaygan olan 'özgürlük, eşitlik' gibi niteliklerini yeriyor. Platon, onu mutlak özgürlükle birlikte mutlak zorbalığın tohumlarını da içinde taşıdığı güvenilmez bir sistem olarak resmediyor. Bu sistemdeki cehaletin, yozlaşmanın ve hatta sokak hayvanlarının bile 'aşırı' özgürlüğünün absürtlüğünden bahseden Platon, bugün çekmekte olduğumuz Demokrasi sancılarının sebeplerini binlerce yıl öteden açıklıyor.

1837256178	Romanian review: Pentru una dintre cărțile care reprezintă fundamentul civilizației occidentale, nu pot decât să mă declar dezamăgit. ,,Republica" este cel mai celebru dintre dialogurile lui Platon, deși, dacă mă întrebi pe mine, este mai mult un monolog al lui Socrate, având în vedere că, în cea mai mare parte, restul participanților la dialog intervin doar pentru a-l aproba. Dialogul începe printr-o discuție etică privind diferența dintre dreptate și nedreptate, Socrate încercând să demonstreze că omul drept este mai fericit decât omul nedrept. De aici, Socrate încearcă să descrie cetatea ideală, mergând pe principiul că o cetate reprezintă oglinda cetățenilor săi- o idee destul de rezonabilă de altfel.Problema mea este felul în care este descrisă această cetate ideală- o cetate în care întreaga viață a cetățenilor este controlată, de la cultură și muzică până la reproducere. Multe dintre principiile lui Socrate sunt atât de apropiate de eugenism, încât, dacă le-am fi regăsit într-o carte de-a lui Hitler, am fi fost oripilați. Pe scurt, majoritatea ideilor sunt extrem de învechite, iar descrierea cetății se bazează pe tot felul de generalizări foarte greu de demonstrat.Totuși, am găsit și câteva idei bune, care au trecut bine de testul timpului. Una dintre ele este că femeile ar trebui să joace un rol egal cu bărbații în ce privește conducerea unei cetăți, iar alta este ideea că potențialul tinerilor ar trebui evaluat de când sunt mici pentru a-i pregăti exact în meseria/domeniul care li se potrivește cel mai bine.Partea cea mai bună din carte este, categoric, celebra alegorie a peșterii. Ideea că percepția noastră este limitată la ceea ce am trăit și că, din acest motiv, este greu să cunoaștem adevărul obiectiv al realității este relevantă și genială. Trecerea timpului nu va schimba asta.Prin urmare, ,,Republica" este o carte care nu a trecut atât de bine peste trecerea timpului, chiar dacă conține și idei bune, universal valabile, încă relevante. Dar, din câte înțeleg (recunosc că nu sunt un expert în ce privește filozofia și istoria ei), relevanța cărții se bazează pe progresul pe care l-a reprezentat pentru filozofie, mai ales, în ce privește dialectica.English review: For one of the books that forms the foundation of Western civilization, I can’t help but feel disappointed. "The Republic" is Plato’s most famous dialogue, though, if you ask me, it’s more of a monologue by Socrates, considering that, for the most part, the other participants only chime in to agree with him.The dialogue begins with an ethical discussion about the difference between justice and injustice, with Socrates attempting to demonstrate that the just person is happier than the unjust one. From there, Socrates tries to describe the ideal city, operating on the principle that a city reflects its citizens—a fairly reasonable idea, to be honest.My issue lies with how this ideal city is described—a place where every aspect of the citizens’ lives is controlled, from culture and music to reproduction. Many of Socrates' principles are so closely aligned with eugenics that, if we found them in one of Hitler’s books, we would be horrified. In short, most of the ideas are extremely outdated, and the description of the city relies on all sorts of sweeping generalizations that are hard to substantiate.That said, I did find a few worthwhile ideas that have stood the test of time. One is that women should play an equal role with men in governing a city, and another is the idea that young people's potential should be assessed early to prepare them for the profession or field best suited to them.The best part of the book is undoubtedly the famous allegory of the cave. The idea that our perception is limited to what we’ve experienced, and that this makes it difficult to grasp the objective truth of reality, is both brilliant and timeless. The passage of time won’t change its relevance.In conclusion, "The Republic" is a book that hasn’t aged particularly well, even though it contains some universally valid and still-relevant ideas. However, from what I understand (I’ll admit I’m not an expert in philosophy or its history), its significance lies in the progress it represented for philosophy, especially in terms of dialectics.
6999262934	4,5 ⭐️Platons Der Staat ist ein fundamentales Werk der westlichen Philosophie, das in seiner Komplexität und Weitsicht weit über seine Entstehungszeit hinausgeht. Durch die Dialogform – primär zwischen Sokrates und verschiedenen Gesprächspartnern – entfaltet Platon eine umfassende und tiefgehende Analyse der Gerechtigkeit, der idealen Gesellschaft und des Verhältnisses zwischen Individuum und Staat.Ein zentrales Thema des Werkes ist die Frage nach der Gerechtigkeit, die Platon nicht nur als individuelle Tugend sondern als Prinzip einer gerechten Gesellschaft betrachtet. Diese gesellschaftliche Gerechtigkeit erreicht er durch die Idee einer klaren sozialen Ordnung, in der jede Klasse ihre spezifische Rolle erfüllt – die Herrscher, die Wächter und die Produzenten. Diese Aufteilung wird durch den Gedanken getragen, dass der Staat nur dann gerecht ists wenn jeder Einzelne nach seiner Begabung und seinem Wissensstand handelt. Die Vision einer idealen Gesellschaft ist dabei stark an das Konzept der Tugend und der Erziehung gebunden.Das berühmt gewordene Höhlengleichnis, eines der philosophischen Meisterwerke des antiken Denkens, illustriert Platon’s Verständnis von Erkenntnis und Wahrheit. In der Höhle gefangene Menschen, die nur die Schatten der Realität sehen, stellen eine Metapher für die menschliche Wahrnehmung dar, die von Unwissenheit und Täuschung geprägt ist. Der befreite Gefangene, der das wahre Licht der Sonne – das Wissen – erblickt, verkörpert den Philosophen, der in der Lage ist, die wahren Ideen zu erkennen und sie mit der Gesellschaft zu teilen.Trotz seiner tiefgründigen Überlegungen hat Der Staat aus heutiger Sicht einige problematische Aspekte. Platons Vision eines Philosophenkönigs, der als unumschränkter Herrscher über den Staat wacht, ist autoritär und steht in krassem Gegensatz zu modernen Vorstellungen von Demokratie und politischer Freiheit. Auch seine Ablehnung der Demokratie, die er als eine Form der Regierung ansieht, die von Unwissenheit und dem Streben nach persönlichem Gewinn geprägt ist, lässt ihn als antidemokratischen Denker erscheinen. Zudem ist seine Gesellschaftsordnung ausgesprochen rigide: Die Strenge in der sozialen Mobilität und die Zensur von Kunst und Literatur, die er vorschlägt, wirken für den modernen Leser verstörend und undemokratisch.Die anspruchsvolle Struktur und die philosophische Dichte der Dialoge können ö eine Herausforderung darstellen. Platon argumentiert manchmal mit Wiederholungen und Überbetonung, was den Dialog teils langatmig erscheinen lässt. Dennoch bleibt das Werk trotz dieser stilistischen Eigenheiten eine der bedeutendsten philosophischen Abhandlungen aller Zeiten, deren Einfluss auf die politische Theorie und die westliche Philosophie nicht hoch genug eingeschätzt werden kann.Abschließend lässt sich sagen, dass Der Staat ein faszinierendes, aber auch kontroverses Werk ist. Es fordert zu einer intensiven Auseinandersetzung mit grundlegenden Fragen der Gerechtigkeit und der politischen Ordnung heraus. Trotz der antidemokratischen Tendenzen und der problematischen gesellschaftlichen Strukturen bleibt es ein unverzichtbares Werk, das durch seine intellektuelle Tiefe und seine Fähigkeit, grundlegende Fragen der Menschheit zu adressieren, auch heute noch von enormer Relevanz ist. 🗣️🗣️

3340546	i have read plato's republic...three times.and i've actually enjoyed every time, although i hadn't thought i would each round.i love greek writing, and though aristotle and thucydides are my favorite, plato is a close second (third?).even if you disagree with the ideas he presents, the ideas are fascinating to discuss. i actually kind of think it is way more fun to discuss when someone contradicts an idea or assumption made.the dialectic style is one of my favorite aspects of the novel. as a fan of conversations, i think this has got to be one of the most essential ways of communicating and debating ideas (i take it with a grain of salt - i am aware that plato was able to manipulate his contradictors - is that a word?... - since he was the author, but still. i like it despite that.)last, the allegory of the cave is sooo wonderful to me. i love the idea - and even though i don't fully agree / believe in it, it has been the springing board of many of my ideas of human knowledge, capability, and (most importantly to a media studies major) reality.
2486699292	When reading Plato, the reader at first fascinated by the integrity of his work and then be faced with dictatorial ideas. But this dictatorship does not mean that it leads to a false position in the contemporary world. The desire for utopia for humans is unbelievable from the beginning, Plato knew this truth better than anyone.This wish should be fulfilled for the world. Both in the imagination of a philosopher and in reality. And still, the world is trying to achieve this vain imagination.
1506364262	افلاطون.. أتعب الذي بعده.
6294767063	Plato lived from 427BC to 347BC. His mentor was Socrates and Aristotle was his pupil. The Republic comprises ten books that explore a variety of philosophical issues. Socrates argued in favour of equality for the sexes as citizens in the ideal polis (city state) which was not the case in the Athens of his time. Other issues discussed include the fundamental character of ultimate reality, the best way to educate people, the nature of the soul, and the structure of a society that emphasizes the individual's role in the community.The participants in the book include Cephalus and Thrasymachus who in Book 1 argue that human beings interact with each other in selfish ways. Thrasymachus represents the Sophist method of philosophy that hinders rather than helps the pursuit of truth and he's not heard from again. In Book 2, Plato's brother Glaucon and Adeimatus appear put forward the idea that justice is obedience to laws agreed upon by consensus within a community. At the beginning of Book 7 you will find the famous / infamous Allegory of the Cave.A contentious item in the book is a profound suspicion of the democratic process. Socrates proposes that the ideal city-state consists of a hierarchy, with executive power resting in the hands of the philosopher-rulers. In Book 8, the case is made that democracy will always be vulnerable to the whims of a fickle public and the ambitions of populists.The Republic was the first serious philosophical reflection on the nature of political justice and individual morality. It was also the first attempt to define the nature of fundamental reality and in particular the nature of goodness.
2242223743	Cu toate că pe alocuri se simt miasme de comunism și eugenie avant la lettre, cu care nu pot fi de acord (mai mult sau mai puțin în totalitate), Republica este o carte de căpătâi și, deși dialogul meu preferat al lui Platon rămâne Phaidros, îi voi de 5 stele pentru multitudinea de idei valoroase cuprinse în ea.Cred că cea mai îndrăzneață idee e distanța care-l separă pe rege de tiran: 729. Un calcul care incă mă pune pe gânduri. Matematica din spate e simplă dar de ce ridici 3 la cub, în plus, după ce l-ai ridicat la pătrat? Cât despre traducere, nu cunosc greaca veche ca să mă pronunț în ceea ce privește calitatea acesteia, însă pe lângă unele dezacorduri și greșeli de tipari nu am putut să nu remarc termenul de „Dumnezeu” inserat undeva în prima parte a cărții. Nu doar că mi se pare nepotrivit la Platon, presupunând chiar și cazul în care traducătorul a vrut o adaptare în limba română a unei exclamații precum atotprezenta „pe Câine!” a lui Socrate, dar e chiar un atavism inversat, dacă mă pot exprima astfel.
4191289452	Took me almost a year to finish this one.I can say that the decision to start reading this book was one of the best decisions I have made last year, but it was also a logical consequence, since I had previously read Apology, Crito and Phaedo, all of which Plato's dialogues as well. The Republic was... A journey. And what a journey it was.It would be honest to say that even after finishing this book I still do not understand some of the ideas included in the text, and besides, there are views with which I could not agree because of my personal beliefs and different life experiences compared to ancient Greek thinkers.What I especially like about Plato's work is the beginning of every one of his books, where he says that he is not ready to define some terms, but through the dialogue developed by the characters in his books, a logical conclusion is reached. Of course, you will notice that Socrates' views and thoughts dominate, but he too would not have come to his conclusions if he had not been provoked to think by the questions asked by the others.What would later develop as an idea of ​​the perfect arrangement of a city-state, begins quite abstractly, where Socrates, Glaucon, Polemarchos, Thrasymachos, Adeimantos, and Cephalos discuss justice and injustice. Although the original idea of ​​Socrates' friends is that injustice brings greater benefits than justice to those who practice it, stating that everybody is in fact unjust as he can be without being found out, and that, the one thing that is stopping people to do injustice is not the fact that they fear to do it, but because they fear to suffer it. Socrates sets out to disprove this view, and establishes that justice is apparently wise and virtuous, and at the same time more profitable than injustice.Socrates acknowledges that the nature of justice is more easily to be discovered in the macrocosm – the state, than in the microcosm – the individual. He develops this thesis through the description of what he calls the perfect city-state, or rather the theory of its arrangement, which I believe is familiar to most of us. Socrates starts with the individual, and argues that society flourishes only if it is efficient. In order to be so, each person must devote himself to the task he is best fitted for, and thus saves himself from dispersing his energy in other tasks he is not fitted for at all, and which he will therefore perform indifferently. Viewed on a macro level, as Socrates claims, this is definitely true and confirmed by today's economics through the theory of division of labour and the models of economic growth and development that arise from it. (I study Economics so I would know, trust me :D)The famous division of society into three layers follows: the highest class, or – the guardians, who require the highest qualities; the auxiliaries and the producers. I do not see the need to explain this in details, because I think their roles are well known. What is particularly interesting is the consideration of the question of how to develop the much needed qualities of the highest class. This leads to the subject of education which, according to Socrates, seems to consist of gymnastics for the body and music (in the broadest sense I’ve ever seen, because, for instance, he takes literature, a part of music) for the soul. By learning to appreciate the good and beautiful in art, they will learn to love them in life. Keep in mind, however, that it is a mistake to suppose that music trains the soul while gymnastic trains the body, because “gymnastics is as much a part of the soul’s education as music is, and the noblest natures, at once brave and wise, require a harmonious blend of the two”.Now, an idea that I really liked follows: according to Socrates, the unity of such society depends mainly on three principals – equal shares for all, so that there are no rich and poor; a physical limit of size of the city-state; and, I CANNOT stress this enough, the recognition of merit regardless of birth. These are to be safeguarded by the educational system previously laid down. Ironically enough, when Glaucon asks whether such perfect city can ever be achieved, Socrates replies “No”. But later on he explains that even though it is an unlikely combination, it is not impossible such a philosopher-king to exist, one who unites wisdom and power.When it comes to the position of women in the perfect city, there are no occupations for which a woman is unfitted merely because she is a woman. Everyone liked that and you should too.Having described the perfect city-state, Socrates proceeds to deal with the four degenerate forms of constitution in the Book VIII. First, the aristocratic constitution degenerates into the timocratic honour-loving constitution in pursuit of glory, when the warrior class prevails over the wisdom-loving class. Second, the timocratic constitution degenerates into oligarchy (the rule of the few) when honour-loving turns to money-grabbing. The city is divided into rich rulers and poor subjects. Third, oligarchic constitution degenerates into democracy (the rule of the people) when the poor in the oligarchic state revolt. All are then free to do as they wish, and as Socrates says “all are free to go to the devil in their own way”. Fourth, the democratic constitution degenerates into tyranny when men tire at last of the lawlessness of a liberty and they appoint a strong man to restore order.This amazing work ends with Book X where mystical elements take place. It is argued that the fortunes of the just and the unjust follow us to the afterlife, since it was believed that the soul does not perish with the body.Thank you for reading this. Means to me a lot.
57204874	The Cornford translation of Plato is still one of the standards, even though other translations might well be better in this age. It is also the version that I used as an undergraduate student at Bradley University in my Political Philosophy class! To get to the point: Socrates' greatest student was Plato. In "The Republic," Plato, through the voice of Socrates, provided the keenest metaphor to describe his understanding of the problem cod defining "reality." His allegory of the cave serves as the takeoff point. Socrates describes the situation to Glaucon thus: [Socrates:]: Imagine the condition of men living in a sort of cavernous chamber underground, with an entrance open to the light and a long passage all down the cave. Here they have been from childhood, chained by the leg and also by the neck, so that they cannot move and can see only what is in front of them, because the chains will not let them turn their heads. At some distance higher up is the light of a fire burning behind them; and between the prisoners and the fire is a track with a parapet built along it, like a screen at a puppet-show, which hides the performers while they show their puppets over the top. . . Now behind this parapet imagine persons carrying along various artificial objects, including figures of men and animals in wood or stone or other materials, which project above the parapet. Naturally, some of the persons will be talking, others silent. [Glaucon:]: It is a strange picture. . .and a strange sort of prisoners. [Socrates:]: Like ourselves. . .; for in the first place prisoners so confined would have seen nothing of themselves or one another, except the shadows thrown by the firelight on the wall of the cave facing them, would they?. . .And they would have seen as little of the objects carried past. . .Now, if they could talk to one another, would they not suppose that their words referred only to those passing shadows which they saw? [Glaucon:]: Necessarily. [Socrates:]: And suppose their prison had an echo from the wall facing them? When one of the people crossing behind them spoke, they could only suppose that the sound came from the shadow passing before their eyes. . .In every way, then, such prisoners would recognize as reality nothing but the shadows of those artificial objects. Next, Plato has Socrates examine what happens if someone is taken from the cave out into the light of day. This person then comes to understand that all is illusion and shadows in the cave--whereas earlier that person had defined the images as reality. In this sense, through education, one could come to see reality and escape the confines of the cave. And when that person would re-enter the cave, he would realize the nature if illusions and be able to try to illuminate with his (or her) wisdom the lives of the people in the cave. This, of course, would be difficult since the denizens of that dark region would not themselves have directly experienced the light of knowledge. Who is best able to see what is outside of the cave? The philosophers, of course. Plato believes that there are absolutes, "forms," out there in the "real world." Circles that we humans craft can never equal the ideal type "out there," what we might call "circularity." There is an abstract idea of circularity, the perfect circle, the essence of circleness. This is the truth of the object. Only through training can a person begin to understand and appreciate these forms, these ideal types. Only those whose passion and talent is the pursuit of knowledge and who can come to possess wisdom are able to see these "forms." Only then can the subject properly "see" the object, in this case circularity. Note, in contrast, the arguments by the Sophists that the subject is incapable of properly perceiving and understanding reality--even if there is a reality to be apprehended! And, in his metaphor of gold, silver, and bronze, Plato makes this even more explicit. Each person, he claims, is dominated by one of three elements--appetite (bronze), courage (silver), and wisdom (gold). It is in our nature at birth which one of these characterizes each of us. Only those whose central core is gold can ever hope to see the forms and understand the absolute truth that exists. The rest are, in effect, condemned to a life in the cave. Education is needed to take the raw material within a person and shape that individual's capacity to come to see truth, to apprehend the forms or ideal types. In the end, then, only a few can ever come to know reality. And it takes them much of their lives before they are adequately enough trained to accomplish this Olympian goal. It is unsurprising, of course, that Plato argues that these few, these philosopher-kings (or queens, since he accepts that women may be capable of these same feats of intellectual insight), should also become the rulers of the ideal society. That is the nature of his "Republic." This is one of the great works of political philosophy. Its assumption that there is a "special class" suited to rule is open to question. His elitism will not sit well with many readers. The belief that humans can apprehend objective reality is also open to question. His sense that individuals are predestined to serve as "producers," "auxiliaries," or "philosopher kings/queens" (yes, he felt that women might become leaders, an unusual conclusion for the time) will not convince many contemporary readers. However, this is one of the standard translations and provides a credible entrée to one of Plato's greatest works.
