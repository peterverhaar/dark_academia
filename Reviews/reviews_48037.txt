4861618595	‘Love will have its sacrifices. No sacrifice without blood.’Step aside, Dracula, Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu is my new yardstick for vampiric stories. You may have heard the big talking point around Carmilla, a queer vampire story published as a serial in The Dark Blue (later collected in La Fanu’s In a Glass Darkly) in 1871 and predates Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) by several decades. But does it live up to the hype? Yes, and some. Set in Austria and drenched in gothic tones of dread, Carmilla is a gripping tale of seduction and bloody horror, treating us to the mysterious Carmilla growing close to 19-year old narrator Laura as a strange plague seems to be killing the young women in the local region. As scary as it is spicy, Carmilla is a riveting read that presents early vampiric lore as well as some excellent examinations of class warfare and a loss of innocence in this chilling coming-of-age tale. Original llustration from Dark Blue publication by D.H. FristonFor maximum reading experience, listen to this song.The notion of a seductive vampire is alive and well in Carmilla, with Le Fanu boldly exploring themes of women’s sexuality. For the 1870s, this book feels pretty erotic, with a lot of caressing and kisses that do not disguise a craving of sexual intimacy between Carmilla and Laura. If one is anxious this will lead to an assertion of the draw of homosexuality as demoic or anything like that, rest assured this is not present in the text. It is frequently noted that the two girls are drawn to one another’s beauty, and even the old men of the book seem charmed by that (the father is actually a rather endearing character). The short novel creeps forward, piling dread upon dread across supernatural sequences with some truly frightening imagery. The gothic setting of constantly grey weather in a countryside full of decaying castles (Le Fanu uses the utterly delightful term schloss as often as possible) set a perfect tone for the tale. This has a growing tension that reminded me of Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw, though it has been suggested that James was inspired by this novel for the narrative framing in his own book. With each surmounting horror, from shared dreams between the two girls, Carmilla disappearing from her room, a shadowy figure walking through the fog down a path beyond the schloss, and frequent deaths in the town, the novel will keep you flipping pages eagerly enjoying this little gothic gem. ‘But to die as lovers may—to die together, so that they may live together.’Carmilla is one of the earlier vampire stories, but by no means the first. For example, The Vampyre by John William Polidori predates it, published in 1819 during the same writers retreat as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein, but there was already a rich vampire lore for Le Fanu to draw from. It has been asserted that 18th century monk Dom Augustin Calmet’s vampire story served as an inspiration, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem of a succubus,Christabel, (and the shared theme of hospitality betrayed) each influenced Le Fanu. A major source of inspiration was also found in a memoir by Captain Basil Hall, Schloss Hainfeld; or a Winter in Lower Styria, which shares the same setting as this novel and the family name Cranstoun is likely the source of the deceased Hungarian family Karnstein in Le Fanu’s novel.That said, an aspect I found interesting reading it in the present is how I had to cast aside any preconceived notions of vampires, as there is a fairly rigid modern vampire lore that has been built over time and any deviation from it always stands out. At the novel’s conclusion there is a brief recounting of what is purported to be known about vampires at the time, insinuating a robust lore this story is immersed in. The story is framed as being from the case files of Dr. Hesselius, Le Fanu’s paranormal detective, and this story functions as Hesselius’ investigation into vampires through a first-person account written to him by a now-adult Laura. In Carmilla, vampires are able to go about in sunlight, but cannot travel far from their burial place where they return to sleep without disturbing the soil above their coffin. One aspect I found rather silly but wish continued through vampire lore is that the vampire can only disguise themselves using an anagram of their name while alive (Mircalla/Millarca/Carmilla). So if you ever meet a dude named Veste--watch out, I’m about to vampire you. Carmilla appears as a black cat instead of a bat and also can more or less teleport. But one description stands out to me:’One sign of the vampire is the power of the hand. The slender hand of Mircalla closed like a vice of steel on the General's wrist when he raised the hatchet to strike. But its power is not confined to its grasp; it leaves a numbness in the limb it seizes, which is slowly, if ever, recovered from.’This is the perfect metaphor. The grip of a vampire will leave you numb forever, such as how the seductive grasp Carmilla holds over Laura will either leave her dead or a vampire like her. It is said here that vampires like to multiply their numbers (which occurs either through being turned, like Carmilla, or suicide), and the story is vague on what Carmilla plans for Laura. I have my opinion, but I think the vagueness makes the story all the more eerie.‘Dim thoughts of death began to open, and an idea that I was slowly sinking took gentle, and, somehow, not unwelcome, possession of me. If it was sad, the tone of mind which this induced was also sweet.’This book situates Carmilla as a member of the Hungarian aristocracy, a line that ended during an uprising. There is an interesting look at class warfare and keeping down of the poor here, with peasant girls being the usual victims from the vampires.The middle-class members such as Laura’s father or the General seem to write these deaths off, assuming some disease spread amongst the poor and that their wealth and schlosses will protect them. There is certainly a disdain for the lower classes, particularly from comments by Carmilla. For her, the poor are merely a meal and we have a pretty blunt metaphor of the rich feeding off the suffering of the poor. Laura, on the other hand, offers her resources and wealth, making her much more alluring (as did the General’s niece). We see the vampire always as a social climber. I quite enjoyed how in order to integrate into human society the vampires here are always presenting a narrative involving intrigue and danger. It seems as if this playacting is a foreplay of sorts to the vampires.‘But dreams come through stone walls, light up dark rooms, or darken light ones, and their persons make their exits and their entrances as they please, and laugh at locksmiths.’What really drives this novel home, however, is the language. Everything is dripping in dread and gothic tones and Le Fanu has a large vocabulary surrounding dreariness and blood (or lack thereof). As the book presents itself as a scientific examination of vampires, it is interesting to note how much humorism plays into the language used. Characters are often described as languid, plaid or languorous to nudge to ideas of the blood being drained. The weather is without warmth or sun and everything is decaying or corpse-like. It is perfect.'You are mine, you shall be mine, you and I are one for ever.'This is an excellent early vampire story that certainly has deserved to survive through the public consciousness. It even influenced Dracula, most notably in the deleted first chapter that later appeared as a short story, Dracula’s Guest, but one can see similarities in characters like the Baron or the General being an influence for Van Helsing. Anne Rice has cited Carmilla as a major influence for her Vampire Chronicles series, and there have been comic and film adaptations of Le Fanu’s slim novel. I quite enjoyed the openness of women’s sexuality here and Le Fanu certainly knows how to succinctly create a sensual atmosphere within an otherwise deathly cold tone. While the ending is a bit abrupt, it isn’t unsatisfying and still leaves a lot to ponder over. Also it’s always fun to consider this theory that correlates the popularity of vampire or zombie media with the rise of either right or left-wing politics. Carmilla is a classic and has certainly seduced me. Now to figure out these bite marks on my neck…4.5/5 Below is art from an unreleased graphic adaptation by Rosemary Valero-O'Connell
52221798	In many ways the antithesis of Dracula, and if Stoker's novel disappointed me with its clean-cut, heterosexual male-influenced dichotomies, than le Fanu's novella is the flipside of the coin: female-centric, homoerotic, ambiguous and enigmatic (and all in about a quarter of the length!). Here the vampire is not the withered, evil "Other" but the beautiful, sensuous stranger that is readily welcomed into home and heart, becoming the double for the protagonist, leading to a very different sense of horror--the necessary destruction not of an enemy but a loved one, perhaps even the self. It's a really eerie, beguiling little novella, uncanny in a way that Dracula only is in brief flashes...

750816181	Bloody relevant to read! BEFORE DRACULA, THERE WAS... But to die as lovers may - to die together, so that they may live together. This is a very important book in historic sense, in the genre of vampire reading, due that it was published 25 years before than Dracula. Also, it presented lesbian situations, easily one of the first open mentions of the topic in literature.So, it was a pioneer book in two subjects: Vampires and Lesbian literature.Some may wonder how it was possible to publish a book with lesbian issues in 1872.Joseph Sheridan Le Fanú was ingenious in that, since when he was asked about, he just replied that it wasn't a homosexual situation since Carmilla was a vampire and due that, it was a creature without sexual genre.Sneaky devil this Le Fanu!Of course, that was a trick by the author but it worked since the book didn't have any trouble to be published in those times when there was a extremely close-minded attitude.And certainly the importance of the book to the eventual sucess of Bram Stoker's novel was fundamental.Without Carmilla there weren't Dracula and due that maybe there weren't a vampire sub-genre in the horror books that now it's one of the strongest subjects in modern paranormal literature. BRITISH GOTHIC Nevertheless, life and death are mysterious states, and we know little of the resources of either. Le Fanú also was the father of the Gothic horror of Britain establishing the style of how that kind of literature would be written even on these days.Maybe the only trouble with Carmilla to be read by current readers is its form of mystery that it's impossible that anybody would pick nowadays this particular novel to read without the previous knowledge that Carmilla is a vampire, and due that, the reader felt like reading a mystery where one already knows the answer to the mystery.The clues to the real nature of Carmilla are elegant and stylish but too evident for any reader familiar with vampire-related similar books, movies, TV series, etc...It's clear that Carmilla started all and the reality is that anybody else copied FROM it, but sadly, in many case, readers find the book way after of being already too familiar with the general world of vampires, diminishing the shock that the book could ever do.However, it's still an important book in literature history.
3216916678	Vampires are gay. They've always been gay. Twilight was literally the first vampire story that wasn't gay. (Unless it was? I don't know, I didn't read it.) Dracula was our pioneering gay male vampire story. Carmilla, which predates it by some twenty years, is our pioneering lesbian one.The authors themselves are not always gay. Bram Stoker was, of course - gayer than a guy who knows how to change the sheets on his bed - but Sheridan Le Fanu, the popular and terrific 1800s Gothic writer responsible for Carmilla, seems like a cousin-fucker but a straight one. And this is, if we're being honest, lesbians more of the "nightgowns and swooning" variety than the "roommates who enjoy pants" variety. ("Roommates who enjoy pants" is what they called them back then.) So this is lesbians by way of the male gaze, and with quite a lot of Daddy Issues mixed in. "My hot daughter's hot friend keeps flouncing about in nightgowns," is one way you could describe the plot. (view spoiler)["Eventually I had to murder her naked body" is how these things end - they find her floating naked in a coffin full of blood, by the way, that's amazing - and (hide spoiler)] I mean we've all seen Poison Ivy, right? Do a shot for every time you see the word "languid". Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bombThe hot daughter and her single father live in an old castle ("schloss" is now a word you know) in the middle of nowhere, because of course they do, and a total stranger driving by leaves her hot teenage daughter with them for a few months because she fainted. That's the plot. They set the nubile stranger up in the bedroom that has a tapestry of Cleopatra holding poisonous asps to her bosom, and can I tell you how much I love imagining that decorating decision. "What if we make this room the Dead Naked Lady Room?" Cool. Cleopatra And The Asp by Girolamo di Benvenuto, 1500ishTownspeople are dying, as they do. Carmilla's door is locked from the inside at night. She comes down late in the morning. "My strange and beautiful companion," says daughter Laura, "would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardor of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet over-powering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, "You are mine, you shall be mine, you and I are one for ever." Then she had thrown herself back in her chair, with her small hands over her eyes, leaving me trembling.Do a shot for "languid." And should this be taken seriously? Is it literature? Is it great vampire literature? Are vampires inherently silly? Sheridan Le Fanu: would you bang, yes or noVampire books are mostly gay and always about sex. Dangerous visitors to your bedroom at night! Certainly Le Fanu intended Carmilla to be hot, and if Stoker didn't intend Dracula to be it was only because he was so far back in the closet that he ended up in Narnia. But of course vampires are predators, as well, so there's an element of "these depraved homosexuals," right? "So hot! But so dangerous! But so hot!" I hope that in these enlightened times we're slightly less panicky about the vast spectrum of our sexual desire. But sex is still dangerous, and it seems to me like a serious concern. Books about sex are worthy. And what other books, particularly in the stodgy 1800s, were about sex? If you didn't smuggle it into a vampire book, where else would you find it? Henry James certainly wasn't helping anyone.What I love about this particular edition of Carmilla by Lanternfish Press is that they've convinced the mighty Carmen Maria Machado, a Gothic lover herself, to write an intro where she says all the quiet parts out loud. Machado first of all insists that the entire thing is true, producing historical documents like a righteous gay Borges, and then further accuses Le Fanu of straightwashing the story. It's not gay enough, she says. The true story would have been about about "a young woman’s sexual awakening; the senseless slaughter of her supposed defiler.” Machado points out that gay passion is often read as murderous (hello, Patricia Highsmith), while making a driveby suggestion that the infamous Countess Bathory (of Blood) was bathing less in virgin blood than in their vaginas. Countess Bathory, one kind of scissor fighter or anotherMachado continues,The act of interacting with text - that is to say, of reading - is that of inserting ones self into what is static and unchanging sounds that it might pump with fresh blood. Having read this introduction, I hope you will enter into Carmilla thusly, using your fingertips and mouth and mind to locate ...what exists below: the erotic relationship of two high-strung and lonely young women.This whole thing is, of course, a meta joke about our modern hobby of declaring old books gay. Carmen Maria Machado is fingerbanging Carmilla. But under that, there's something serious going on, right? This is a declaration of our right to interpret old books however we want to. The book is as gay as we say it is, she suggests. The words on the page are, of course, static and unchanging. But when we go down on them, we open them up and find new meanings hidden inside, and those are not only valid but crucial to the survival of the book. If there's nothing hidden in it, it doesn't matter. "Girls are caterpillars when they live in the world," says Carmilla, to be finally butterflies when the summer comes; but in the meantime there are grubs and larvae, don't you see - each with their peculiar propensities, necessities and structures.A book can be lurid and great at the same time, and Carmilla certainly is both. I love every preposterous sentence of it. Look at this indelible scene where the vampire appears at Laura's bed, her nightgown drenched in blood. Illustration from the Lanternfish editionThe image was echoed by Stephen King 100 years later in Carrie, another great novel about the terror of feminine sexuality. It's spectacular, and Carmilla is still a gripping and unnerving book. It has plenty of secrets and peculiar propensities left for our probing fingertips.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>

5031402824	Before Stoker's Dracula.But after Polidori's Vampyre.There was Le Fanu's Carmilla!So. Kind of like the middle child of vampire tales.This one was much shorter and much creepier than Dracula, in my opinion. Carmilla was a scary bitch. And part of that was because she was this ethereally beautiful creature that charmed her way into the family's hearts, not some zombie dirt-muncher that was mindlessly roaming the moors looking for the odd sleepwalker. Although she did like a bit of light snacking in between the main meal, as a lot of peasants in the area surrounding Laura's home fell ill and died from some unknown wasting sickness.Oh, and little Carmilla has a bit of a crush on the naive Laura. “I have never been in love with no one, and never shall," she whispered, "unless it should be with you.”That was interesting.Apparently, Stephanie Meyer wasn't the first author to write a creepy watching you sleep scene, either. Only Carmilla liked to stab a fang in Laura's tit every now and then. So. Unbelievably, the point goes to Edward for being a gentleman and keeping his canines to himself whilst he sat in the corner of Bella's room. There were actually a lot of creepy scenes in this.Starting with the opening scene where Laura describes meeting Carmilla for the first time when she was just a little child. She just pops out from under her bed like the boogeyman and proceeds to do her vampiric worst, then slithers back under there and disappears until Laura is a young woman.Talk about the long-term stalking game. When they find an old portrait of someone who looks a helluva lot like Carmilla in the attic...Whaaaaaat?!I swear to god, I've read so many books like this that if I find a hundred year old painting that resembles someone I know, I'm 100% going to just stake them on the spot. They are definitely a vampire. You know it, I know it, and there's no court of law that will convict me because everyone in that jury box will have read some shit like this before and be nodding along with me. They were undead. Nothing to be done but run a bitch through. NOT GUILTY.Ok, I can feel myself going off the rails a bit, so let me just end this by saying that this is my top old-timey vampire story. Highly Recommended!
4335276946	Laura lacks company in a remote part of Steyria when her father gives shelter to a mysterious young girl named Carmilla. Soon after young women are beginning to die. Who is the girl? Did she use another name in another century? Is there any connection between her and the unusual death rate in the area? This is the quintessential gothic vampire novel. You really find all the motifs (ruined castle, ruined chapel, a masquerade, uncanny setting) and a detailed description of the "revenants". The novella is masterly plotted in 15 chapters and a conclusio. Starting slow the story soon turns into an absolutely intriguing nightmare. This tale preceded Dracula and is absolutely compelling. The gothic vampire classic. Must read!
4996035597	I am iffy, if the Irish author, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, wouldn’t have died early, hadn’t he sued Bam Stoker and many others, for blatantly nicking the plot premise of “Carmilla” and replicating into Dracula and so many others (both written and motion)!😊Carmilla, a mid-1800s, first novel on female vampirism (quintessential of vampirism), tastefully captures the European wilderness, with the narrow roads, gothic bridge and the drawbridges. This gothic masterpiece, has been classified as one, displaying lesbianism, and accused of homophobia, which is quite vexing and questionable for me!Can’t two females, devoid of love, with a lacking childhood, find solace and ardour, in each other’s company?Yes, the love between the two, has been portrayed a wee erotically, but I didn’t find anything obscene or smut!I read the scenes between the two, repeatedly, and didn’t find anything vulgar, but for acute fondness for each other. Laura keeps talking of her antipathy for Carmilla, but capitulates to her open and warm-hearted ardour and affection. This cyclic emotional-wheel of antipathy, extrication and fondness, has been portrayed throughout the novel. For me, it was nothing more than - Two solitary souls, living a solitary life, finding company in each other!One might conjecture, that in the mid-1800s, such fondness in friendship, between same sex, was uncommon, and hence reprimanded!Without divulging the intricate details, an abridged plot-overview:-Laura, the protagonist, begins narrating her story. She resides, along with her father, General Spielsdorf, in Styria (a region in Austria) in a castle/schloss. She is accompanied along with Madame Perrodon, the governess; and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, her “finishing governess.” She lost her mother in her infancy.One fine day, she is out with the maids, and they see a carriage over turned, the mistress of the cart was to continue with her journey, but Laura requests her to let her daughter, Carmilla stay with them in the castle to recover from the accident!“If you confide this young lady to our care it will be her best consolation.”The two, start living together, getting enraptured with each other, and become best friends. Carmilla is open, warm, and effusive with Laura, but Laura is inhibited and wonders at Carmilla’s level of confidence. She feels a tiny degree of repulsion but the attraction overwhelms her.Laura, finds oddity in certain habits of Carmilla, like she locks the door from the inside at night, she displays languor and lassitude. There are moments, when Carmilla is utterly consumed by a passion for Laura, and kisses, grasps, and tells her they will be one. But I see Laura just being used as a prop by Carmilla, who is still battling with her emotions towards Carmilla!Eventually, Camilla’s health starts deteriorating, Laura too falls sick, and strange bewildering things start taking precedence. Read to know more! 😊😊###########################Stars-Distribution: -I give 4-stars to this Victorian gothic tale!More than a vampire-tale, this effectually sways the readers hypnotically, across various other issues, of culture, gender, sexuality.More than the gothic element, I found, Laura's adoration and yearning for companionship versus actual attraction towards Carmilla, far more appealing and compelling!The trail of death left behind by the vampire, is defined as a disease which passes like a parasite/infection, from one to another. This tale has all the vampiric credentials, but I see it as more of a cultural breakthrough, about gender and sexuality. It may garner a lot of literary criticism, for the scenes between the girls, but I found them aesthetically narrated, propelling from a place of lack of love!!There is a constant unwillingness and antipathy from Laura(keeps trying to extricate herself from Carmilla’s hypnotic charm), but Carmilla’s affections keeps wooing and overwhelming her.There is a magnetism and repulsiveness. One can revel in their fondness and antipathy!! The bond between the two is uncanny.In my view, the novella, reflects cultural advances in the Victorian era, and is just not a mere female vampire tale, but a metaphor to showcase female prowess and sexuality! The novella is intriguing and pretty much plausible.I wouldn’t have docked a star, only if it was captured as a novel and not a novella! I didn’t want it to end so soon!
4063770465	Lesbian vampire novel that pre-dates Dracula by 25 years? Sign me up! Carmilla (1872) was in fact a huge influence on Bram Stoker, as shown by many subtle references in Dracula (1897) and more obvious ones in "Dracula's Guest". Largely a forgotten classic, today Carmilla is receiving something of a revival thanks to an increased academic interest in queer artifacts and this new edition that's edited by Carmen Maria Machado.I'm a big fan of Machado, especially her brilliant 2019 memoir In the Dream House. She's also an astute scholar of pop culture and distinguished LGBT voice, so the perfect person to offer gentle commentary via footnotes. This edition also includes some steamy illustrations not to be missed.The story follows Laura, a secluded and lonely girl, as she's befriended by a supernaturally beautiful woman who preys exclusively on other attractive young women. In addition to draining blood, Carmilla seduces with old-fashioned kisses and whispered affectations:...with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, "You are mine, you shall be mine, you and I are one forever." Then she had thrown herself back in her chair, with her small hands over her eyes, leaving me trembling (37-38).The "You are mine" line here is an early example of a vampire's possessiveness, which will be echoed by Dracula when he proclaims of Jonathan Harker: "This man belongs to me!”Such sentences also depict precedent-setting vampire sensuality, where pain and pleasure are an enticing combination. While being seductively handled, Laura admits to “blushing,” feeling “embarrassed” and describing the encounter as “hateful and yet over-powering” — but it's also clear that she's enjoying herself. From the beginning, or at least as far back as John Polidori's "The Vampyre" (1819), the literary vampire seems to be an outlet for repressed desire and exploration of taboos.Consider this juicy paragraph, of which Machado observes: “If this isn’t an orgasm, nothing is.” ...sometimes there came a sensation as if a hand was drawn softly along my cheek and neck. Sometimes it was as if warm lips kissed me, and longer and longer and more lovingly as they reached my throat, but there the caress fixed itself. My heart beat faster, my breathing rose and fell rapidly and full drawn; a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation, supervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion, in which my senses left me and I became unconscious (69).All these conflicting feelings described here are admittedly complicated, overwhelming, and a lot to wrap one's head around. Is the scene supposed to be scary? Hot? Why not both? The reason vampires have been sexy for hundreds of years is largely because of this mixture of emotions, not in spite of it.Like salted caramel, the vampire’s bite is a duality of flavors. Bittersweet. Being punctured about the neck is a painful sensation, but wrapping that feeling in a layer of ecstasy is how the vampire succeeds in an almost Darwinian way. By directing supernatural levels of pleasure toward the receptive partner, not to mention the enticing possibility of immortality, vampires make being their victim as much fun as possible. In a way that is scary—and hot—because the victim is willfully drawn to their own demise, enjoying every moment until it's all too late.Mosquitoes could learn a thing or two.

4534623292	My complete review of Carmilla is published at Grimdark Magazine.Carmilla by J. Sheridan Le Fanu is the one of the first great works of vampire fiction, published in 1872, about a quarter century before Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Like the undead titular character, Carmilla is a timeless work, brimming with vivacity and an irresistible yet dangerous allure.The teenaged narrator, Laura, lives with her father in an old Austrian castle. As a six-year-old girl, Laura dreams of a young woman looking over her at night, a singular beauty whom she cannot erase from her mind. Upon waking from her dream, she discovers a mysterious pain in her chest.Many years later, a carriage breaks down in front of their castle, and the family is left to take care of a beautiful girl, Carmilla, who appears to be the same age as Laura. Laura and Carmilla immediately recognize each other from their childhood dreams, and a close-knit friendship blossoms. This friendship soon crosses over to romantic courtship as Carmilla’s desires grow more carnal.Meanwhile, girls across the village are succumbing to a mysterious illness, unexplainable by any natural means. The locals believe that the girls are becoming sick through supernatural means and are determined to put an end to this evil.Carmilla is an early masterpiece of Gothic fiction, setting the standard for vampire fiction for 150 years after its publication, and its influence has only grown in recent years. Personally, I enjoyed Carmilla a lot more than Dracula, which seems rather stodgy by comparison. J. Sheridan Le Fanu should also be commended for his natural and non-judgmental depiction of sapphic love, which is surprising for something published in the nineteenth century.Overall, Carmilla is a must-read for lovers of Gothic fiction and vampire horror. J. Sheridan Le Fanu’s classic novella is somehow just as vibrant today as when it was published in 1872.

The plot itself was boring at times, but overall the story was engaging enough that I managed to finish it in two days.

I loved everything about it, even with the ridiculously complicated use of the English language that I struggle with every time I read a classic novel. I read it on my Kindle, and there isn't a single page where I didn't highlight at least one unknown word, yet it didn't tarnish my reading experience in the slightest. To begin with, the plot is incredible!! Even with the unquestionable knowledge that Carmilla is a vampire, I still found the book astonishing. It is full of subtle mysteries and shocking plot twists that never really crossed my mind until they were revealed. I am particularly fascinated by the way Le Fanu interpreted vampirism and the lore that surrounded it. Although, revealing that suicide turns a person into a vampire is problematic. That definitely did not age well... Other than that, the lore is so original, and I can clearly see the way it has influenced literature, television, and cinema to this day, especially Bram Stoker. It is obvious from the numerous similarities between Carmilla and Count Dracula precisely how Stoker was inspired. I should say that while both novels are wonderful, Dracula doesn't hold a candle to Carmilla, and it's an absolute shame that her story never got equal recognition.Moreover, Carmilla is a phenomenal character. I loved how she charmed and manipulated her way into her victims' lives and slowly drained them until their death. It is a little weird and absolutely hilarious that it's so easy to convince people to let her stay with them in their homes for long periods of time, even though she is a complete stranger. I guess she really knows how to use her gender to her advantage 😏😏 She even has her own familiar to help her scam unsuspecting people's blood right out of their necks. I particularly love how, despite all her power, she still has flaws and insecurities. She not only craves blood but also affection and devotion from her victims. She needs to feel loved as much as any living creature, maybe even more so. Additionally, there's also Carmilla's current victim, the guileless, kind-hearted Laura, who is also the narrator of the story. Laura is a lonely young girl who has experienced strange encounters since she was a child involving the deceitful vampire. Her point of view is a first-hand account of exactly how Carmilla manipulates and uses her victims, the emotions she elicits from them, and the full extent of the relationship she has with them.Furthermore, I am wholly confounded by the stark same-sex relationship between Carmilla and Laura. I went into this book with the knowledge that there is lesbian content depicted inside, but I was absolutely clueless as to how it is presented. I only assumed there would be some undertones indicating the true relationship between the two women but I ended up being completely, and happily wrong. These girls couldn't have been clearer about their relationship, and it is truly AWESOME!! Yes, the relationship is incredibly toxic. Yes, it is obvious from the start but, until the shit hits the fan, it is quite lovely. What surprised me the most, however, is the absurd impossibility that such an anachronistic book was written in the nineteenth century and was actually published, yet here it is. That is until I realised that people back then in their ignorance were unable to realise that same-sex relationships between two women existed and were hilariously blind to what was really written on the pages of this book. I also got the impression that Carmilla might actually be bisexual as she had been in a relationship with a man before she turned. Unfortunately, there isn't enough exposition on this topic. However, this love story is also pretty adorable.All in all, this book is wonderful. It deserves more love than it gets, and I honestly wished I had read it sooner, before I read Count Dracula.✨Thank you for reading✨
3025691013	Genial. ¡Me ha gustado mucho! una pena que sea tan cortita porque me hubiera encantado leer (y saber más) de la terrorífica Carmilla.Si os gustó la maravillosa 'Drácula', disfrutaréis de esta novela también, tienen el mismo estilo e incluso atmósfera, aunque 'Carmilla' fue anterior.Recomiendo además la edición ilustrada por Ana Juan, es cierto que la traducción tiene alguna expresión "rara", pero en general no está mal y las ilustraciones son maravillosas y consiguen envolverte y atraparte por completo.
4735615896	"In an isolated castle deep in the Austrian forest, teenaged Laura leads a solitary life with only her father, attendant and tutor for company. Until one moonlit night, a horse-drawn carriage crashes into view, carrying an unexpected guest -- the beautiful Carmilla."- Description taken from the Pushkin Press edition of the novel. Carmilla was published more than twenty years before Dracula. I feel like I should stress that as everyone tries to treat the good count as if he was the proper introduction to vampires (let's not even get into The Vampyre by John Polidori which is another conversation entirely).If I'm to be completely honest, the fact that Dracula gets all the love over Carmilla is more than slightly frustrating, as in my opinion, Carmilla is actually a better vampire story and manages to pull it off in almost 1/4 the page count. That's not to discredit Dracula as I gave it five stars as well. Both are excellent stories, I just feel Carmilla is the more exciting of the two.Carmilla is just such an interesting little tale. While Dracula had moments of homoerotic subtext, Carmilla is flat out blatant with it. Zero subtlety here, Carmilla is obviously trying to seduce our lead. Carmilla also uses a rather interesting tactic to get close to her victims which makes for and interesting tale… it's also rather fascinating that she's very much featured throughout the book whereas Dracula has very few pages in his own book. This is such a delightful little book. One I can see myself revisiting again in the future. Well worth a read to all fans of classics and/or horror. 5/5 stars.
7739774957	No gothic book can come close to this. Everything about this book is PERFECT!From the moment the enigmatic Carmilla crashes into the sheltered life of Laura, I knew I was in for a ride!The atmosphere is dripping with gothic charm, where crumbling castles, moonlit woods and fainting fits are all part of the daily routine.But don't be fooled by the demure Victorian setting- underneath the lace and polite conversation lurks a sensuality that was, frankly, scandalous for its time. Carmilla herself is a captivating enigma – by turns charming, languid, possessive and utterly, terrifyingly predatory. She’s the kind of houseguest you secretly dread, yet can’t bring yourself to ask to leave, especially when she starts whispering sweet nothings in your ear (view spoiler)[(or... you know, draining your life force). (hide spoiler)]The thing that makes this so fascinating is its (unapologetic) dive into female desire and forbidden love, long before it was acceptable to do so. The tension between Laura’s fascination and fear, her undeniable attraction to Carmilla mixed with a growing sense of dread, is palpable. It’s a beautifully unsettling dance, where the line between affection and obsession blurs with every moonlit night...
1856176901	Horror Reader Shocker! Spooky Vampire Leaves Wannabe Author Prostrated!: "What the FRACK!!! I can't get her out of my head!" - Vampire Guild WeeklyAfter reading this book, I am left frustrated and oddly underwhelmed, and yet there is an undeniable and dare I say it 'uncanny,' power to this story which is a mystery to me.The smartest character in the story is the antagonist (who is not that smart), who proceeds to charm and bamboozle an array of protagonists who are all very nice, and not the least bit given to suspicion of others.There are multiple events where the fact that Carmilla is a vampire is hinted at with growing strength, up to and including the discovery of a perfect portrait painted in the dim past. Le Fanu doesn't quite get to the point of hanging a sign, written in fresh blood around Carmilla's neck proclaiming, "I am a vampire, and I am here to kill you." But he gets close.With the characters stumbling about in their ignorance as the Vampire runs rings around them - I was left imagining shooting fish in a barrel. I found myself thinking what if a terrible blizzard arrived that shut up the Schloss for 3 days (and especially 3 nights). Leaving Carmilla alone with only the hero - Laura (our narrator), her father, the governess, and the other staff without any hope of escape. As the death toll mounted, the presence of a vampire would quickly become obvious. Laura would then be confronted with a need to make a decision of consequence and take irrevocable action. Something she really doesn't get much of a chance to do.Passive characters, especially if the narrator are frustrating.On the plus side, the author has made an excellent stab at establishing the vampire genre. He has also provided a clever subplot of lesbian love. Neither would have been easy to do in his day and age.Also the description of the actual vampire attacks is genuinely spooky and admirable writing.While this book failed to excite me with it's general lack of pace and suspense, It has deep qualities that many would appreciate. Especially those with a taste for "Creeping Horror."On a decidedly UNCANNY personal note. ... I had a dream, an incredibly VIVID dream, while reading this novel where I was visited by a magnetic, alluring, dark-haired female vampire and I willing offered my arm to her. Something that I have never done before in a dream. What was also noteworthy was the experience of an abiding personal intimacy that accompanied the act of freely giving blood to sustain another.The sultry summer evening had barely given way to the night. I had left the bedroom doors open to the balcony to allow a light breeze to circulate. I lay back on the bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. The house belonged to me, I was its sole occupant, but the loneliness of this house weighed heavily - it was not a home.Moonlight cut through the room, then it vanished for an instant. A momentary shadow flitting through the doorway, entering my bedroom and filling it with a pervasive sense of possession - the room was no longer mine.My heart thudded in my chest. I sat up suddenly, pressing backward against the headboard. There was someone in the room, the feeling of Her presence was overwhelming, but I couldn't see anyone - there was no one there.The shadows thickened at the end of my bed. I stared, frozen where I sat, as the shadows coalesced into the ethereal shape of a young woman. She wore a light diaphanous gown. Her hair was lustrous black, her skin pale like marble, her eyes were large and dark, her lips red, full and slightly curved in a coy smile.Her form solidified. A faint perfume filled the air. She seemed deeply familiar, and yet, I had never seen her before - at least I had no memory of ever meeting her and I'm sure I would not have forgotten.She moved to her right, floating, lithe, serene. She was majestic and mesmerizing - power beyond words was bound up in her gaze. Her eyes glittered like black diamonds, brilliant and hard. I couldn't tear my eyes away from them even if I tried.She sat down beside me, gently picking up my left arm with her cool hands. She turned it over, palm up. I didn't resist - I didn't want to. I lifted my arm up and she lent forward. A bell rang in the distance, a muffled warning - ignored and discarded in the face of her needs. Needs I was a willing servant to.Moonlight gleamed on her ivory fangs. She leaned further in, first kissing, then licking - finally biting. A single drop of blood fell off my wrist, dark against the white bed sheet. She murmured in delight, my heart beat hard in my chest, but I stayed still - unwilling to disturb her feast.Everything was for her...(inspired by my dream while reading this book...)I am left wondering just how deep this story can creep into you when you read it?Strongly Recommended. 5 'Spooky Vampire Kisses Beneath the Moonlight,' Stars.

4321371893	Carmilla tiene asegurado un lugar muy preciado entre los libros que más me han encantado. Tanto por su historia como por lo que representó en su tiempo. Y es que Carmilla es una gran representación del gótico, del vampirismo con una mirada femenina bastante sugerente y ligada al lesbianismo (tema tabú en su época de publicación). Además de que tampoco es larga ni se hace pesada en ningún momento, convirtiéndose en esos relatos que te lees en un solo día.La ambientación gótica es uno de sus puntos fuertes. Te lleva por sitios solitarios y oscuros, envolviéndote en esas atmósferas con poca iluminación y que están llenas de sombras. Y no solo eso sino que te hace un recorrido por lugares tétricos como los extensos pasillos, habitaciones sombrías y desoladas, castillos viejos y en ruinas, tumbas y cementerios, bosques silenciosos y perturbadores. Y como no puede ser de otra forma, todas las escenas transcurren mayormente al anochecer; cuando solo está de compañía la luna en el basto cielo.Lo segundo por resaltar es la figura del vampiro asociada a una mujer y como esta se entrelaza fuertemente con el interés afectivo y sexual hacia otra mujer. Con una clara referencia a la homosexualidad de dos mujeres que se atraen, quizás no de la forma más adecuada pero que con pinceladas y trazos delicados Sheridan Le Fanu logra transmitir esa tensión existente entre ambas. Sin embargo, esa misma relación no es tan dulce y romántica como parece a primera vista, ya que tiene connotaciones eróticas muy marcadas y tiende a ser algo más salvaje y peligroso al venir de una criatura sobrenatural.Además, como último punto creo que la extensión (aunque a mí se me ha hecho corta y quería más) me parece que no peca de repetitividad. Es bastante cercana al ser en primera persona ya que asistimos a un relato en el que solo quieres saber el desenlace de una vez por todas y la voz es directa y va al grano, sin rodeos; cosa que se agradece. Y aunque el único defecto por mencionar es que puede ser predecible a día de hoy, creo que con lo mencionado anteriormente es más que suficiente recompensa al ser una historia llena de supersticiones, pesadillas, personajes que no saben cómo hacer frente del todo a este ser sobrenatural en un entorno igual de siniestro y la indudable representación lésbica entre sus letras. Para mí, estos elementos son lo que la hacen una lectura que merece ser recomendada y leída por cualquier persona que esté mínimamente interesada en el vampirismo, el terror con una ambientación gótica y sin duda invirtiendo un tiempo que no será desperdiciado en lo más mínimo con esta historia. Que por cierto, si no fuera por Fernanda (amiga de Goodreads de confianza), quizás ni me hubiera enterado de la existencia de esta obra. Solo he tenido como referente a Drácula y pues sí que me molesta un pelín y me entristece bastante que esta esté a la sombra del primero cuando tiene venticinco años de anterioridad. Pero de lo que sí estoy seguro es que si Drácula contruye el arquetipo del vampiro masculino, Carmilla es el arquetipo femenino del vampirismo. Y eso me parece una razón más que suficiente para leer el libro y conocer la otra cara de la literatura que utiliza este tópico muy frecuentado por lectores.

3065454510	4 Stars for Carmilla: A Vampire Tale (audiobook) by J Sheridan Le Fanu read by Megan Follows. This is a very early gothic vampire tale. It was written 26 years before Bram Stoker wrote Dracula. It’s a rather short but very poetic story. I find it interesting to see how this mythology got its start. This was a great audiobook...5
1569321808	With Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, some of the most famously recognized horror stories of the nineteenth century have been created, yet only few people seem to know this little story which may have been the ultimate inspiration for Bram Stoker to write his popular novel Dracula. Carmilla is an early vampire story, laying the foundation of a genre which would see many other vampire tales in the upcoming years, until the development recently culminated in the seemingly perfect picture of the attractive, charming and oh so sexy vampire. Le Fanu's tale, only 100 pages long and perfect to read as a two-hour-long distraction during a Sunday afternoon, may seem unoriginal and inferior compared to the huge stories listed in the beginning ... but looking closer at this, it might be easier to realize that "Carmilla" is much more than that.Set in a gothic atmosphere surrounding the Austrian castle home of the first-person narrator, eighteen-year-old Laura, and her father, Carmilla tells the story of a young lady who comes to visit them under mysterious circumstances, with death and nightmares falling over the inhabitants of the castle and the vicinity soon. Not only does this premise introduce an interesting development - seldomly could it have been possible to find a female character in such astonishing circumstances in the 19th century - but also does the author prove himself to be far ahead of his time, including several homosexual allusions and thus being one of the first authors of his time to do so. Most of the events in this novel are implied rather than accurately explained, which strengthens the chilling atmosphere and makes up for a thrilling reading experience.Le Fanu's writing is anything but tiresome. While the gothic influence can easily be recognized in the novel, it feels like the writing could also have originated in modern days. Slowly does the horror creep inside the pages, and short chapters as well as fast-paced scenes help the reader to hasten through those pages. Apart from the dumb and rather annoying protagonist and the casual, perhaps even lazy characterization, Carmilla is a fascinating tale which should be read by everyone interested in the gothic horror genre and, generally, by horror readers.
5145958704	welcome to 202-Queer 🌈✨, the year where i only read queer books and finally have fun 🌈✨i hope we can all agree that vampires are only good if they are queer. what's a straight vampire except a waste of space. edward who?this was a fantastic start into my reading year. it had all a good story needed: beautiful writing, gothic vibes, a sapphic vampire.did the author write this with the intention of "yay lesbian vampires"? who knows! did i read it going "YAY LESBIAN VAMPIRES ✨✨🌈🌈"? definitely, and that's the only thing that matters

7345877769	A predecessor to Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Carmilla is the tale of a sultry lady vampire who spends centuries wooing women only to feast from them after gaining their trust. Some might see this as a warning against befriending hot goth weirdos but remember that this was written by a man so what does he know? God forbid a girl have hobbies (eating people).
8032394572	Carmilla by J. Sheridan Le Fanu 5 🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮orbsDuke ClassicsStyria, Austria…1871💡 Orbs Prologue: The squish of earthy mud sounds beneath my leather riding boots. A dense fog rolls off the bog, concealing the mysterious scene before me. I grow closer beneath the shadows of overgrowth, spotting what seems to be a gilded carriage upon its side. A regal lady dressed in black velvet is spotted speaking with an older gentleman, presumably the owner of the nearby castle. Maintaining my distance, a beautiful young woman is ushered into the Schloss, piquing my curiosity. Hiding beneath the brim of my top hat, I slither to the awaiting shrubbery. Shall I knock on the palatial door? I am worried for the woman’s well-being. In the stone-cold silence, I wait. Soon, through rather ornate sash windows, I spy the beautiful forms of two women, looking out into the distance. Oddly, the victim of the carriage incident stares ravenously at what I would assume is the daughter of the castle owner. How quickly they have become friendly; one must question, why?🔩 Nuts & Bolts: Nightmares have awakened Laura from her slumber. These visions are laced with such credible realness that she feels the awkward physical pain of the aftermath. Sparking a series of unimaginable events, a runaway carriage has hatched a new visitor amongst the confines of the castle walls; Carmilla is her name. Carmilla’s mother must attend to important affairs; thus, she is unable to wait for her daughter to recover from any ailments caused by the crash. Upon the promise of coming back at a later date, Carmilla’s mother leaves her to stay with Laura’s family in the nearby castle, with one caveat. Carmilla’s history is to remain curiously absent, a deal that has been struck between Carmilla’s mother and Laura’s father that no talk of family history must be discussed. Why? An air of familiarity floats between Laura and Carmilla, and they strike an unbreakable bond from the beginning; however, due to the murky nature of Carmilla’s backstory, a heightened sense of tension for those involved emerges. J. Sheridan Le Fanu's depiction of the relationship between the women far transcends normality. Submerged beneath the surface remains a hunger that drives a love and need for ravenous desire. The gothic eeriness of the novel unfolds, and readers are exposed to the truth, glorious bite by bite, as it were. 👍 Orbs Pros: Le Fanu’s prose is simply gorgeous. The eloquence of writing transports readers to the year of 1871, Austria. The gothic texture enraptures the reader, rendering us simply part of Le Fanu’s twisted yet magical tale. The subtle complexity of the character relationships left me enduring a kaleidoscope of emotions. Was I left to dislike Carmilla or sympathize with her situation? The overall brilliance of how much Le Fanu conveys in so few words is inspiring. 👎 Orbs Cons: None! Must Read! Stated simply, this is not to be missed! 💡 Orbs Epilogue: The clarity shone through an open window. An air of deception crept through, tickling my senses. No, there was something amiss. Shall I alert the man in charge? He might think I am crazy. There is a primal decrepitness crawling along the bowels of this story, one that holds the key to the hauntings of Styria. I slowly gather myself, dusting off my frock coat. I will admit my hesitancy as I quickly walked along the muddy path. I looked back upon the Schloss with sorrowful misery. My own fearfulness has begged me to travel far from here, and who am I to question that which resides within the recesses of my intuitions, whose sole purpose is to protect this body at all costs?

7443308068	In these mysterious moods I did not like her. I experienced a strange tumultuous excitement that was pleasurable, ever and anon, mingled with a vague sense of fear and disgust. I had no distinct thoughts about her while such scenes lasted, but I was conscious of a love growing into adoration, and also of abhorrence. This I know is paradox, but I can make no other attempt to explain the feeling.Laura and her father invite a mysterious young lady Carmilla to stay with them after a carriage accident near their estate, just as the village sees some mysterious deaths by oupire. Laura and Carmilla become the best of friends of course, until Laura starts feeling weak and tired. Carmilla is not only one of the first vampire tales, but also one of the early Gothic horror stories involving sapphic relationships. A large part of the book deals with Carmilla's and Laura's growing friendship and contrasting their feelings towards each other, through Laura's naive teenager point of view. Sheridan le Fanu's writing balances psychological unease - fear of the unknown with outright horror of the paranormal, and the story unfolds at a steady pace ramping up to the finale. On the whole, a masterpiece recommended to anyone interested in Gothic horror!“You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is always selfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am you cannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me, and still come with me, and hating me through death and after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.”🌟🌟🌟🌟1/2🌟[One star for the premise and the whole book; One star for the characters; 3/4 star for the story and themes; One star for the world-building; 3/4 star for the writing - 4 1/2 stars in total.]
1873318235	I have to admit - I like this work just as much (if not slightly more) than Dracula! Yes, I know - some of my friends have told me this is blasphemy - but it does predate Dracula - and I found this work much more erotically charged. The story of Carmilla and Laura can be appreciated on several different levels; a coming of age tale that is also a thinly veiled exploration of blossoming sexuality. This novel is almost a Hammer template; most of the castle settings are drawn from this original and innovative work. A classic that deserves a much wider audience.

18368275	Note, Oct. 1, 2012: I just modified this review slightly to incorporate a changed perspective I came to as a result of a discussion in one of my groups.This book is one of the best treatments of the vampire theme I have read (admittedly, I haven't read very many --even counting the ones I didn't like enough to finish!). While the author's diction is Victorian, the book is a short, quick read (unlike the massive tomes that some 19th-century novels are), so it shouldn't be daunting even for readers who have a problem with old-fashioned prose. Unlike John Polidori's Lord Ruthven and the title character of Varney the Vampire, LeFanu's vampire is female. He concentrates on psychological horror rather than on blood and gore, and does not try to eroticize the vampire's activities. (Carmilla definitely does use language in places that suggests that she demands an attachment from her female victims that borders on romantic love, which gives her attitude what today would be called a "lesbian" undercurrent; but we can also fairly say that even though she wants strong female attachment, it's not genitally sexual in nature.) The atmosphere of menace and suspense easily evokes the reader's concerned attention.One of the characters here is an eccentric scholar with knowledge of vampire lore (a kind of adumbration of Stoker's Van Helsing). Also, Le Fanu indicates the hostility between the vampire and Christian faith (his vampire, of course, is in the classic mold --an instinctively evil embodiment of appetite and cunning malevolence, rather than a person with a moral free will and an individual personality, like many modern fictional vampires), but doesn't develop this theme as fully as Stoker does in Dracula. For a reader who enjoys seeing fiction in its historical and literary context, it's fascinating to see the way elements whose seeds are planted by the earlier writer are more fully developed by the later one!

1183569870	"The amphibious existence of the vampire is sustained by daily renewed slumber in the grave. Its horrible lust for living blood supplies the vigor of its waking existence. The vampire is prone to be fascinated with an engrossing vehemence, resembling the passion of love, by particular persons… It will never desist until it has satiated its passion, and drained the very life of its coveted victim."This description of a vampire is not anything new and surprising to anyone that has an interest in vampire lore, but what is amazing about these words are that they were written prior to Bram Stoker's Dracula. Le Fanu's Carmilla is a short but impressive tale of a female vampire which I found to be wonderfully gothic and appropriately spine-chilling. Rumors of a strange sickness circulating the area of Styria in Austria come to the attention of a young lady, Laura, and her father at their secluded castle. Shortly thereafter, these two find themselves with a very mysterious guest following a carriage accident just outside the confines of their palatial home. Laura, our narrator, reflects upon the face of this guest as being one that appeared to her in a very vivid and disturbing childhood dream. Despite this fact, the lonely Laura becomes quickly attached to her newly found companion, Carmilla. "I did feel drawn towards her but there was also something of repulsion. In this ambiguous feeling, however, the sense of attraction immensely prevailed… she was so beautiful and indescribably engaging." As time goes on, Laura is not able to glean any background information from this extraordinary guest. Where did she come from? To which place was she headed? And, why did her mother leave her in the hands of strangers whilst hastening on to some secretive destination? The suspense of the novel increases as Laura becomes once again plagued by nightmares and strange occurrences. A gradual decline in Laura's health and sinister reports shared by a respected friend in the neighborhood prompt Laura's father to obtain answers and spur him to action. The events that follow are dramatic and exciting. I found the plot of this book to be a bit uneven at times. It also seemed a bit too short - I think the story could have been developed a bit further. Overall though, there was great atmosphere, and it was fun and well-done for an early vampire story. It would translate really well into an excellent movie! 3.5 stars
4636400142	„a hideous black woman, with a sort of colored turban on her head“- I am once again reminded why I avoid certain “classics”. I don’t want to read books written by bigots. ‘But it was a long time ago, things were different back then!!’ ok idc, there are plenty of books from a long time ago that don’t include blatant racism and I’d rather just avoid the ones that do.

You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me, and still come with me, and hating me through death and after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.” First things first: when people told me this was one of the most queer classics, I expected subtext, but what I got was full-on dark sapphic romance that enraptured me more thoroughly than most of the sapphic passions I've read from this century. This is just as much a gothic romance as it is a horror classic, and I was in awe from cover to cover. “Nevertheless, life and death are mysterious states, and we know little of the resources of either.” Carmilla also amazed me in the fact that, despite having spent my entire life being more fascinated by vampires than afraid of them (in fact, I don't believe any vampire tale has ever unsettled me until now), there were scenes in this book that had me literally peeking over my shoulder while listening to the audiobook at night. Carmilla is a force to be reckoned with and I adored the terrifying manifestation of her in those darkest moments. “You are mine, you shall be mine, you and I are one for ever.” Whether you are a horror fan, a gothic romance lover, or simply enjoy a good vampire tale, I'll echo the many voices who have claimed Carmilla as a must-read. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Jodie Harris and thought the narrative was simply perfect — 5 stars all the way around.✨ Representation: sapphic romance✨ Content warnings for: (view spoiler)[blood drinking, bloodshed, illness, death, toxic romance (hide spoiler)] ———twitter | booktok | bookstagram | blog
2515802893	"No puedes imaginarte lo celosa que estoy de ti. Tú has de venir conmigo; has de quererme hasta la muerte. O puede que me odies, da lo mismo. Pero ven conmigo y ódiame a través de la muerte y del más allá"La historia de la terrible Carmilla es contada por Laura, quien de pequeña vivía en un castillo o schloss en Estiria, sitio éste bastante propicio para las situaciones siniestras y oscuras que suceden. Uno se pregunta para qué la gente vive en esa clase de lugares donde no hay nadie alrededor, jaja, pero así son los relatos de horror.Un buen día llega una joven llamada Carmilla con una señora que aparentemente es su madre, ambas jóvenes (Laura y Carmilla) empiezan un vínculo que progresará a medida que avance la obra y por un evento azaroso es preciso que Carmilla se quede en el castillo. La situación en la que Carmilla es encargada al padre de Laura es por demás extraña y el hermetismo que muestra la joven y su propia madre empieza a despertar sospechas.Mientras Laura se siente cada vez más atraída hacia Carmilla, algo que para la época debió ser muy chocante, pues Carmilla declara claramente y sin ambages que ama a la protagonista y ella por su parte no la rechaza del todo. Pero Laura empieza a sentirse débil y con una gran descripción de parte del autor empezamos a introducirnos en el mundo vampiresco, luego vienen tópicos digamos que fueron reproducidos posteriormente con la pertinente investigación y desenlace.Aunque el género de terror y los vampiros no es de mi gusto (por eso en parte no le pongo un puntaje tan alto), debo mencionar la buena pluma del autor pues su estilo aunque no enrevesado es muy bueno y sus descripciones siempre acertadas. No llegué a sentir la tensión como en Drácula probablemente porque Carmilla parece narrada como un "cuento de hadas" y no genera la empatía que los personajes de Drácula.
1273304855	I'm glad this was a novella. While the plot is interesting and the writing is just superb the entire concept of "oh she's a vampire, no wait, she's a lesbian vampire" gets tired quite quickly. However this is one of those works that you have to read just off of its sheer influence alone. The trope of the lesbian vampire was so important in early horror movies, B-movies and especially Giallo horror. (Also I love the fact that two of the most pioneering and influential works of vampire fiction were written by two Irish guys, go us!)
7290189518	*Antecesora de la obra de Bram Stoker, Carmilla nos sumerge en el retrato de una vampira inusualmente bella, encantadora y embriagante a los ojos, cuyas víctimas son mujeres jóvenes con las cuales se relaciona más o menos sentimentalmente. Y más allá de que dicha conexión a ratos pueda resultar ambigua, la sexualidad de Carmilla es innegable, y por su año de publicación el lector puede suponer que esto fue un tema controversial entonces.La narradora, Laura, inicia la novela recordando un evento de su infancia que la marcó de forma permanente: tuvo un sueño muy extraño, en el que una mujer de innegable belleza rondó su pieza por la noche, y sin entender por qué despertó por la mañana con un gran dolor en su pecho, como si alguien (o algo) de fuerza sobrehumana hubiese hecho presión sobre su cuerpo.Laura creció junto a su padre en un antiguo e inmenso castillo en medio de la nada, y aunque no podía decir que fuese infeliz, sí se sentía sola a ratos y ambos sabían que necesitaba pasar más tiempo con gente de su edad, como parte esencial de su madurez. Por esta razón, la inminente estadía en el castillo de la hija de un viejo amigo de su padre resultaba ideal. Sin embargo, extrañas circunstancias terminaron con la vida de la joven, por lo cual su padre pospone el viaje y decide quedarse a investigar qué fue lo que realmente mató a su hija. Laura no tuvo demasiado tiempo para estar triste por la pérdida de una posible futura amiga, porque esa misma tarde, después de un accidente en carruaje de dos desconocidas frente al castillo, una mujer le pide el favor al patriarca de hospedar a su hija Carmilla en su vivienda durante el tiempo que ella tarda en ir y volver del destino que la apremia. Si bien en principio el padre de Laura se muestra incómodo y escéptico, no tarda en caer rendido a los encantos y simpatía de Carmilla. Además, su hija comienza muy pronto a mostrar un mejor ánimo, porque la visitante resulta ser increíblemente hipnótica y excelente compañía. El destino pareciera haber intervenido de forma directa en su -no tan- fortuito encuentro, porque descubren que ambas soñaron con la otra mucho antes de conocerse. Y aunque esta pudo ser una temprana advertencia para Laura de que algo extraño rondaba a su alrededor, tienen que pasar varias cosas más en la novela que la hagan recién abrir los ojos. Carmilla no sale de su habitación sino hasta que se esconde el sol, comienza a mostrarse errática, esquiva y su ánimo fluctúa, mostrándose a ratos dura con Laura, para minutos más tarde no poder dejar de llenarla de halagos y no quitarle las manos de encima. Conforme avanza el tiempo y la madre de Carmilla no da indicios de volver pronto, comienzan a darse desapariciones, ataques y muertes de algunas doncellas. Aunque la medicina intenta explicar de forma razonable los decesos, trascienden los rumores de que los reales responsables son vampiros. El inicio de los ataques coincide con la llegada de Carmilla, pero nadie parece unir los puntos. Mucho menos Laura, casi siempre hechizada por la belleza, magnetismo y atenciones de su ¿amiga?Creo que la interpretación de dicho vínculo queda en las manos de los lectores. Las inclinaciones amorosas de Carmilla me resultan muy claras, pero podría considerarse (y ser también valida) la idea de que Laura por su parte ve a su acompañante solo dentro de un marco amistoso, dada la falta de vínculos tales con otros de su edad mientras crecía. Como fan acérrima del mundo vampírico de Anne Rice, estoy convencida de que los vampiros fluyen sexualmente, por lo que la idea de que estas dos mujeres se vincularan a nivel emocional y Laura le correspondiese a Carmilla en cuanto a sus sentimientos me fascina. El personaje de la vampira Carmilla no es como la describen quienes la conocieron antes de llegar al castillo, sino que más bien su imagen coincide con la idea que se formó Laura de ella. Es encantadora, hipnótica y sensual. No es un vampiro monstruoso como lo podría ser Drácula o Nosferatu, incluso Lestat de Lioncourt, sino un ser dulce, solitario, misterioso y hermoso, y cuenta con una feminidad que aunque se diferencia de la que posee Laura, se complementa de forma casi perfecta con ella.Si bien le pongo cinco estrellas, me hubiese gustado que el desenlace contase de varias páginas más, sobre todo por la forma en que las protagonistas se relacionaron previamente. Tal vínculo merecía un cierre por sí mismo, sin más personajes alrededor.
4883203377	To my utter surprise, the 1970 Hammer Horror "classic" The Vampire Lovers—the primary innovation of which was to free the nipple, whereas vampire movies to that point tended to work strictly with the top half of the breast—turns out to be, in fact, a highly faithful adaptation of Carmilla. This surprising instance of literary fidelity within the canon of 1970s vampire B-movies meant that I knew exactly what was coming at near every turn of Sheridan Le Fanu’s 1872 novella—although I suspect that even a careless reader, going in blind, will have the book figured out nearly as quickly. All in all, this was a disappointment, although it has its pleasures, especially in the scenes Laura and Carmilla spend together. As a landmark in the vampire genre, Carmilla is quick and stylish enough to be worth an October evening. As an examination of queerness, however, I would say the novella is primarily of academic interest, if that.

3634741351	Carmilla, though not terrifying by modern standards, is a captivating read from the 1870s that significantly influenced the genre of vampire fiction, particularly Bram Stoker's Dracula. Touted as the original vampire tale, the story is narrated by Laura, who recounts her youthful experiences with the enigmatic Carmilla. The narrative is unique for its time in its portrayal of the intense relationship between the two women, marked by Carmilla's magnetic beauty and charismatic presence. Le Fanu explores sapphic themes, presenting Carmilla's overtly romantic obsession with Laura while Laura's own feelings are fraught and complex, as she is both drawn to and repelled by her mysterious houseguest. This dynamic adds depth to the story, highlighting themes such as forbidden desire and fear of the unknown. Laura's internal struggle with homosexual desire grows in its fervency as Carmilla's somewhat predatory focus on her intensifies.The writing is beautifully done, and the pace is brisk, making this a quick yet engaging read. It is a compelling, female-centred vampire tale with rich sapphic overtones, exploring themes of queerness and female agency, which has left me eager to explore more stories in Le Fanu's famous collection, In a Glass, Darkly.Watch the Halloween reading vlog here: https://youtu.be/0vphkBXq6zsTrigger/Content Warnings: murder, blood, violence, racism, homophobia (both external and internal), suicideYou can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | TikTokYou can join our book club over on Patreon...PBB Book Club
1317329330	¡Me encantó esta historia! Todo empieza con la narración de Laura, quien dice que nos va a contar cómo cayó en las garras sutiles y peligrosas de una vampiresa y cómo al final logró librarse de ella. La manera en que Laura relata lo sucedido es convincente y transmite las emociones de miedo, ansiedad, fascinación, debilidad y asombro que ella pudo haber sentido en cada momento. Además, me pareció increíble que el relato no sea para nada gore, pues no abusa de la sangre ni las escenas truculentas. Y la verdad es que no lo necesita porque la ambientación que logra el autor a través de las palabras de la impresionable Laura termina siendo lo suficientemente gótica y oscura en sí misma. Como en todos los relatos clásicos de vampiros que he leído, hay elementos recurrentes; sin embargo, no sé por qué, pero tengo la certeza de que esta historia se va a quedar en mi cabeza muchísimo tiempo. Quizá sea por los personajes que están bien construidos y delineados, quizá sea por los diálogos... No lo sé, no lo sé, pero la recordaré.
4513298991	Esta novela corta contiene todos los elementos clásicos de la literatura gótica: un castillo antiguo y solitario, un ser sobrenatural (el vampiro), un aire de misterio, etcétera. Pero dos elementos distinguen a Carmilla de la obra cumbre de la literatura gótica y los vampiros, Drácula. El primero es el sub-texto lésbico entre la protagonista y Carmilla, y el segundo, el hecho de que Carmilla fue escrita 26 años antes de la obra de Bram Stoker, y sin embargo es mucho menos conocida. La recomiendo para cualquiera interesado en sumergirse en la literatura gótica a través de una lectura más breve que Drácula.

2556867587	Me gustó. A pesar que en nuestros días es un relato bastante predecible, tiene el atractivo de los clásicos del vampirismo, con esa ambientación fuertemente arraigada en las supersticiones del norte de Europa, que caracteriza a los vampiros como seres de naturaleza vehemente y pasional, al punto de representarlos de una forma bastante erotizada.Sobre todo encontré muy atractivo el final, donde el Barón Vondenburg (el “Van Helsing” de esta historia) se dedica a contar la historia de la condesa de Karnstein. Sin embargo, me quedan algunas incógnitas; me hubiera gustado saber sobre las personas que acompañaban a Carmilla y que la ayudaban a introducirse en las familias, con unas estrategias bastante originales.Un libro que se lee rápido, que atrapa y que logra traspasar esa sensación de desasosiego ante las diferentes situaciones que viven los personajes. Una buena lectura, la recomiendo.
3634311509	Cuanto me alegro de haber leído éste clásico vampírico gracias a una lectura conjunta de un grupo de Facebook en el que estoy. Ha sido una sorpresa muy grata. Y eso teniendo en cuenta que el tema vampiros no es lo mío. Pero sumando la forma de narrarlo, la ambientación, ese castillo. Todo el misticismo que esconde Carmilla...Esos parajes. Todo 💚Y me he quedado con ganas de más. Se me ha hecho demasiado corto. Me he sorprendido al saber que fue la precursora de la gran conocida Drácula. La obra que estoy reseñando fue escrita 25 años antes que ésta (1872) y Stoker se inspiró en ella para crear su mundialmente conocido mito 😍Le Fanu se basó en la legendaria historia de la hermosa condesa Isabel Báthory ("la Condesa Sangrienta") para crear a la bellísima Carmilla con esa larga melena negra, esa tez pálida y delicada y esos profundos ojos negros. Además de esas manos con dedos y uñas largas que podemos ver en una de las ilustraciones 😱Aunque pueda parecer una lectura simple me ha fascinado la forma de narrar de Le Fanu. Cómo me he metido en la historia 😍 He intentando intercalar su lectura con otro libro que tenía pendiente pero me ha sido completamente imposible. Desde que he leído el prólogo no he podido soltarlo.Mucho tiene que ver la maravillosa edición de #Siruela ilustrada por #AnaJuan. Un lujo ir leyendo y perderme en esas ilustraciones.Si ponemos la obra en contexto, debió de ser todo un escándalo por ese trasfondo de relación lésbica entre las protagonistas, Laura y Carmilla, los dos personajes que más destaco de toda la novela ya que en los demás no se profundiza casi. Todo el peso de la trama cae sobre ellas. Otro plus para la obra, que sean ellas las protagonistas por excelencia, que sea narrado desde el punto de vista de la joven Laura de sólo 16 años. Maravilloso y muy recomendable.Hasta el Epílogo me ha sorprendido aportando datos sobre el mito del vampiro que no conocía y el cual no voy a desvelar aquí 😜 Tendrán que hincarle el diente jaja 😂 Y si es en ésta edición mucho mejor para los sentidos ❤➡➡➡ https://m.facebook.com/LaLocadelosLib... ⬅⬅⬅
2579431855	This was my first reading of this classic tale of dark secrets written in 1872. 1872?! That fact stuns me after finally giving this novella a read. There is a quite a surprising amount of sexuality for such an ancient tome or did the world get ever more prudish as the years went by? There were lesbian kisses and touches and I think I even detected a wee bit of some non-consensual touchy-feely too! But, man, is it ever flowery in its telling. The purple prose is oh-so-strong but it really does throw one back in time and allow the atmosphere to drip off the page so I’m not complaining. Just prepare yourself for some unrestrained writing. There are trembling embraces and languid and burning eyes and so much more to behold here. Basically this a story about a sheltered young lady whose father takes in a strange, beautiful young lady named Carmilla after her mother inexplicably leaves her for three months to take care of some business or another. Carmilla is ailing from what appears to me to be nothing more than a case of the vapors but mom dashes off anyway, saying she cannot take the poor ailing thing along with her. Hmmm, I don’t know about the rest of you but that would make me mighty suspicious! Carmilla is ailing from something a bit more sinister than the vapors and mom’s dump and drop makes a lot of sense when everything is eventually revealed. I won’t reveal the whole thing because it’s short and I think you should read it for yourself. Just know that it was enjoyable and beautifully atmospheric and if you’re a fan of Dracula and all of his offspring and offshoots, you should give this a read.
5497284324	”My strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardor of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet over-powering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her; and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, ‘You are mine, you shall be mine, you and I are one forever.’”This was quite the encounter for our protagonist. Living on her grand estate in the Austrian countryside, Laura has never experienced lust, not even the conventional attentions of a man involving a dark alcove with heavy panting, groping hands, and a thrusting wine drenched tongue. She’s taken aback by the aggressive attention of her new friend Carmilla, and this wellspring of passion doesn’t seem right, yet she is flattered by the attention of this beautiful, beguiling, and mysterious woman.What?

3065972499	Found this one in audiobook on Libby.I adored this book, actually. It's creepy and scary, which I like. The character Carmilla herself is creepy. She just dissolves out of the stone pattern of the walls one night and bites Laura, and yet next thing, Carmilla is accepted by the whole family as part of the family, and how perfectly natural that she should be attached like a leech to young Laura. For me, it is this power of persuasion and social control that is truly terrifying in this story.Honestly, I would have given this book 5 stars, and thought I would nearly the whole time through both readings except the ending lost me both times. I wanted something eerie and understated and didn't get it. What's there will likely work very well for DRACULA fans, but maybe not as many Machen fans, like me!Creepy, terrifying, a wonderful classic vampire tale.

7238415744	My first interaction with the text 'Carmilla' came in the final year of my undergraduate English degree. I was taking a class on Gothic Literature where we were assigned a reading list of most of the staples of Gothic Literature. Some of those texts were 'The Castle of Otranto', 'Zofloya/ The Moor'; 'The Lifted Veil'; 'The Blood of the Vampire' and of course, 'Carmilla'. I will admit I did not enjoy taking that class, it was the height of the COVID pandemic, zoom classes were not working for me as a dyslexic student and I was being crushed under the weight of my course load and struggling with the general grief and dread that we were all dealing with. It was not a great time to be taking such a morbid class and so understandably, I was not really in the right mindset to engage fully with any of the texts. (Which really was a shame because this class was the only class I've had in my ENTIRE university career that was taught by a black woman, and the title of the class was literally SEX AND DEATH: EXPLORING THE FORBIDDEN IN GOTHIC FICTION - I mean how cool is that?)I decided to revisit Carmilla and definitely enjoyed my experience with it a lot more this time around. Something I was very surprised to find out during that class was that Carmilla predates Stoker's Dracula. I think because everyone always talks about Stoker as being the founding father of the modern vampire, I always assumed that nothing significant had been published in that vein, turns out I was wrong. For anyone who is not familiar with Le Fanu's 'Carmilla', the way I'd describe it in less than 10 words is... "toxic victorian lesbians and wonderful writing". I think I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in Gothic fiction, but I will issue the caveat that not that many people seem to state when they recommend this book, that there is some problematic language around race (anti-blackness) - specifically towards the beginning.Anyway, had a good time (for the most part) reading this, love toxic victorian lesbians.
6701120072	Title: CarmillaAuthor: J. Sheridan Le FanuGenre: Horror ClassicPublication year: 1872Review: The last time I read this novella-length story was when I was in high school when my favorite librarian directed me to what to her estimation was a proto-horror, vampire story with scandalous themes of lesbian love. I had loved the story back then, and was thoroughly scandalized by the what I deemed at the time to be the naughty bits. In my re-read, I found little to be shocked about and actually found myself emotionally moved by the relationship between Carmilla and Laura.Here, Laura has led an isolated life, inside a vast castle where she lives with her father. When a carriage accident occurs near the castle, Laura invites Carmilla to stay in her home while she recuperates. Soon Laura finds that she has yearnings for Carmilla and begins suffering symptoms akin to the symptoms of others in the village nearby. A priest visits to essentially fix the situation; however, the priest complicates matters.There are questions posed as to whether Laura's desires are natural or if the vampiric lure has caused Laura to behave in ways antithetical to her nature. Consequentially, this is recognized as an important work for its exploration of themes of identity in a mainstream work for 1872, it strikes me as courageous. Hence, the perfect stars. This is also creepy AF.
2253849041	''I hate funerals. What a fuss! Why you must die—everyone—must die.'' Carmilla can drink my blood anytime. Kill me you sapphic queen. Poor girl, just wanted a girlfriend but they kept dying. Laura is the definition of useless lesbian. I said what I said. “All things proceed from Nature.” She is not evil. She is just a regular predator. Her actions aren't more evil than the actions of any other predator. She has to drink blood to survive. It’s just a natural instinct.I think that this is the first female vampire novel and not the first vampire novel. I don't know why some people say it's the first vampire novel. People also say that it probably influenced Dracula. We can't be 100% sure but I can see it and honestly Carmilla is way better.

2259003749	Laura lives in a secluded black castle amid an extensive forest in Styria with her father; a wealthy English widower relieved from his services to the Austrian Empire. On a stroll through the forest one gloomy evening, Laura comes upon the sight of a wrecked carriage with a lone young woman inside. She is a mysterious and intimidating noble from the family of Karnstein, her name is Carmilla. Once Carmilla is in the care of Laura's family, bizarre things begin to happen around the castle. The tenants fall ill. Sickness and misfortune spreads. Puncture marks appear on the bodies of the victims. Then, Laura and her father remember that Carmilla bears a striking resemblance to a ghastly woman who once haunted their nightmares in the past. The wicked woman they once thought was merely a figment of their imaginations has come to their home in the flesh. For what little time she's given on page, Carmilla is an intimidating character. She is charming and cruel, broken and detached. A delightfully scary and haughty lady. I can see how she inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula. The book was revolutionary in many ways, introducing the world to the first-known female vampire in the starring role of a novella, breaking the rules of the puritan society it was written in by exploring female sexuality and homoeroticism (in a similar fashion as Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray) and combining horror with various other genres such as gothic fiction, paranormal romance, political drama and psychological ghost stories. Carmilla transforms the naive and innocent girl Laura into a woman through her signs of genuine affection as well as her malicious manipulation tactics. Carmilla's mere presence leaves a lasting impression on Laura, imprinting tragic symptoms of trauma-induced heartbreak upon giving her a sort of spiritual awakening as she's made aware of the darker side of the world. The only thing I didn't like was how quickly the ending cuts off without giving any clues as to what really happened. But one can say that the mystery of the eerie conclusion leaves a lot to the imagination.My rating: 3.8/5

5032572998	For being written in the 1870's this was certainly ahead of its time. Carmilla a beautiful vampiress has a liking for young women. Her calling card, seduce them with words by day, then seduce them at night by sucking their blood. Poor lonely Laura falls under Camilla's spell. Their meeting was not by happenstance but by design. Carmilla has been aware of Laura for some time. This short story is told through Laura's eyes from that first meeting and what transpires after. We experience her vivid dreams, her conflicting feelings, and finally her realization.I thought the character of Carmilla was enchanting yet complicated. Was it love, lust, or hunger? Was it simply just the nature of the beast? I choose all of the above. You may see it differently. I believe it's all in the eye of the beholder. For this vamp lover though, Carmilla can suck my blood any day of the week.
