5226995933	sapphic carmilla retelling??? say lessDripping with blood and brimming with desperation, An Education in Malice is an intoxicating gothic academia intimately entangled with fraught relationships, desire, and obsession. S.T. Gibson places her own twist on the story of Carmilla, reinvigorating it with an intense dark academic atmosphere and rivalry between two young women aspiring for the attentions of their poetry professor. Dark urges intensify and in the dark corners of Saint Perpetua’s College lie in wait something that could test the growing bond between two former adversaries. Gibson’s prose is suffused with hunger and violence, a glittering and deadly knife point through which she ensnares her readers in the journey from estrangement to complete and utter devotion. This is a gorgeous story. An Education in Malice is a bloody feat made ready to devour. A retelling I will be singing praises to for ages to come.Thank you to Orbit Books for providing the review copy.Follow me on Instagram
6302006931	DNF @72% I'll just keep this really brief- Full disclosure- I listened to the audiobook. I wasn't impressed with the narrators at all, and I feel like I would have felt the same way if I read the kindle or physical book. But the advantage with the kindle as I would have known each chapter as it alternated between Carmilla and Laura.Still, I don't think it was the best decision to include both POV's. With just Laura's it would have been more mysterious and given an obscure and haunting vibe. With both, it was just muddled.In the audio, I honestly don't recall ever hearing the switch and I had to use more brain power than I wanted to in order to decipher who the hell was talking. Their voices sounded exactly the same. Maybe there's some greater meaning to that but I honestly don't care. It didn't work for me.The pacing was incredibly slow and while this novel has all of the makings of what should have made for a great read... I just couldn't stay engaged.On the plus side, I do intend to read A Dowry in Blood and not give up on the author. "A sensible girl would leave. A good girl most certainly would. But I was tired of being sensible, and I was tired of being good."🩸Sapphic 🩸Dark Academia 🩸Vampires 🩸Gothic 🩸Dark Fantasy Here I go jumping around genres and books again without any real rhyme or reason - just wherever my mood takes me. I've heard mixed reviews on this one... but I'm hoping it delivers 🤞✨💚🩶🖤
6227577931	"For those who didn't make it out of the ivory tower unscathed: you have always been worthy." ★ 3 starsYou'll enjoy this book if you like:➸ Dark academia ➸ Academic rivals to lovers ➸ Sapphic vampires / LGBTIQ+ representation ➸ Dual POV This is a Carmilla retelling, following two academic rivals, Laura and Carmilla. Both girls have an infatuation with their demanding poetry professor, De Lafontaine. Carmilla is a confident, headstrong character, whereas Laura is timid on the surface and insecure about herself and her sexuality. Both girls seek validation from their mentor and peers to the point of obsession, blurring the lines between desire and academic approval. "Erotica was one of the only places I could find frank discussions of my own proclivities, rendered in fantastical prose that both titillated the body and delighted the mind. Reading those books felt like slipping on a beribboned mask and surrounding myself to the whirl of a hedonistic masquerade, plunging into a world where I was at once at home and a stranger in a strange land." I love dark academia, however, I haven't read anything like this before. S.T. Gibson's writing prose was captivating and I was constantly on my toes, not knowing where this book was heading. This book is very character driven, which kept me from rating this book higher as I struggled to connect with the characters. This was largely to do with the involvement of the professor, De Lafontaine. There was an imbalance in the power dynamic so I struggled to accept the relationship. Overall, the academic rivals aspect was executed well between Laura and Carmilla. While I did enjoy aspects of this, I did find the characters frustrating and the plot was slow at points due to the large focus on the characters themselves. The writing was beautiful and it was the main appeal to me. I can't wait to read the author's A Dowry of Blood. I would still recommend this book for fans of gothic romance!Thank you NetGalley and Little, Brown Book Group UK for sending me an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review ⎯⎯ ୨ Pre-review: ୧ ⎯⎯The stress of being approved for an arc less than a week before publication 😩 I love dark academia so hopefully this is worth the speed reading I'm going to have to do 🤭
5852198762	2.5/5The way I absolutely loved the idea for this book, but I couldn’t, even when I really wanted to connect with it and its characters. I literally took a break from reading for two days after one of the major plot twists.. I think that shows enough how absorbed I was in the story. A Dowry of Blood will always be one of my most beloved stories, but this one, at least for me, lacked that something that would make me love it. I simply didn't care, the characters were just fine, the plot bored me and I felt like something was missing here. Unfortunately, a bit of a letdown for me.Also, not Marie Curie, but Marie Skłodowska-Curie.

6159338847	I felt certain that I could perish like this, suffocated by her thighs, and die perfectly happy. Spice: 🌶️🌶️🌶️⚠️Trigger Warning: Uneven Power Dynamics, Inappropriate Student-Professor Relationships, Toxic Academic Environments, Graphic Deaths, Exhibitionism, Kink📍Release date: 15 FebruaryWhy have I not read S.T. Gibson before? This is amazing! It's one of the most well-written retellings I've read so far. I love Carmilla so much, it's one of my favorite classic novels of all time, and I think I might love this just as much. An Education in Malice has all the best elements of the original, especially its eerie, gothic atmosphere, but with a much-improved love story in a new and modernized setting. Besides, like most vampire stories, it has a fair amount of gore and explicit sexual content. Of course, I liked it. In fact, I was completely hooked on the story. I was dying to reach the ending, in particular, to find out how different it would be from the original.Moreover, I love this version of Carmilla. She is just as charming, confident, and enchanting as she is in the original novel, although she lacks the manipulation skills of the classic book's character. She also has her own point of view in this book, something I would have loved to read in the classic. At the same time, she is so young and naive, she is desperate for love and validation to the point that she becomes easy to control and manipulate. As for Laura, this version of her character is, admittedly, a little more interesting than in the classic.She is the same sweet, well-mannered girl she was in Carmilla, just as easily manipulated and controlled due to her naivete and lack of social skills. Just like Carmilla, she is desperate for validation and approval which leads to several questionable choices, even when she knows better. What took me completely by surprise was her soft-core dom kink. I saw the trigger warnings but I honestly expected them to be for Carmilla. I guess it's always the quiet ones, right guys?Lastly, the relationship between Carmilla and Laura is completely different from the classic. It isn't about power imbalance and manipulation like in the original, although they do experience that from a third party. Their relationship is about two young girls trying to figure out their growing feelings for each other. They live in a world where those feelings are immoral, and in an incredibly toxic environment where they are pitted against each other. On top of rivals-to-lovers, the romance is slow-burn, although their attraction is immediate, tension-filled, and explosive. No matter how hard they try, how many insults they throw at one another, or how many obstacles they have to overcome, they can't stay away from each other. It might sound like nothing new in romance books, but it's what makes me swoon every time.
5836705828	Well, well, well. This was a little disappointing.Set in the world of A Dowry of Blood, what we have here is a quite straightforward sapphic enemies-to-lovers trope with a background of vampirism.The characters, frankly, felt unremarkable and shallow as the author doesn’t really delve into their psyche. The ever consuming loneliness of the vampirism or the dark mystique associated with it wasn’t explored. “But then I got what I wanted, and now I don’t know what to want. I’ve always known what I wanted, Laura, I’m positively made of wanting. It’s strange, to be sure of so little.” Thought the prose flowed easily, the writing lacked the lyrical yet obsessive/frenetic energy which I loved in her earlier work.You could frankly more or less get the same book if you remove the vampirism altogether. Even the romance felt easy- they turn into lovers pretty quickly/suddenly. It didn’t provoke the yearning desire in me to see the characters together. The subplot came up like an added afterthought, remains in the background for most of the book, the antagonist only showing up to provide an ending for the plot. The character De Lafontaine could’ve been broken down further. She frankly came off as a jealous teenager masquerading as a mature adult despite being over 200 years old.All in all, the trigger warnings in the start are more interesting than whatever happens in this book.~ ARC received through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
5693602108	sapphic, dark academia, vampires, rivals and gothic… this really ATE! such a fun quick read. i do feel like the relationship moved to fast in the sense that they literally went from rivals to lovers but there was nothing in between that. i understand because the romance wasn’t the main part of the book but i do wish it were drawn out better. the vampire club scene was my favorite thing ever and is why the book has 4 stars instead of 3. I was really worried when i started this story that there was going to be an intimate relationship between them and the teacher but that’s what i respect about the book because it focuses on the negatives that can happen with teacher/student relationships and how much they seek validation from someone that holds all the power. not just by being their teacher but also being an older vampire.
5603728363	An Education in Malice is a dark academia Carmilla retelling set at a Massachusetts women's college, following Laura and Carmilla as academic rivals in a poetry seminar - presided over by a mysterious and ruthless professor. And okay. I didn't love it. The positives:Dark academia often struggles to escape the shadow of The Secret History or If We Were Villains, but An Education in Malice manages to maintain its own identity. It interrogates the relationship between professors and students, and how professors hold institutional power that they can leverage for their own benefit - an area I think this genre has only just started to explore. Gibson's prose is direct, without frills, meaning that the pace moves quickly and that the moments of more descriptive imagery land with impact. The negatives:This book is so, so dedicated to telling and not showing. I cannot express how bizarre it is to read a character's internal narration list exactly what their personality traits and interests are upon their introduction, and then to never explore those traits in the actual story. This impacted Laura the most, I think, who clearly wanted to be a complex, multidimensional character. She is studious and competitive, shy and intense, sheltered and dominant, religious and independent - and she tells us this, constantly! But she studies off the page, her religion has no impact on how she thinks or perceives the world. Conversations and key events are summarized retroactively. As a result, these character descriptions feel inauthentic, and a roadmap for who Laura should be as opposed to who she is. Carmilla I felt like I understood better, but only because she's a less complex character, fitting the prideful + sassy + insecure archetype. I was able to substitute characteristics from this understanding to compensate for her lack of dimensionality, but this didn't exactly lend itself to an interesting character. Both of these characters are 'obsessed' with poetry, but share their writing exactly once, in the very beginning of the book. Like I just don't believe them!This also meant that the book's exploration of kink within their relationship was unsatisfying. Genuinely funny that when Carmilla is introduced she tells you exactly what role she would like to play within a relationship, and why! It is easy to show your readers that your vampire love interest is a bratty sub! Why are we doing this!All of this led to the relationship feeling insubstantial. Of course I am supposed to assume they will get together, as their BDSM preferences are immediately stated to complement each other. When they go from rivals to lovers, there's little room for the grey area in between that allows them to try to navigate their new relationship and explore how they fit together. They used to hate each other, but they love each other now. It's no more complicated than that, but it should be. Another issue I had with this book concerned De Lafontaine and the way she ties into the story. (view spoiler)[ As mentioned above, the thematic crux of this book rests on critiquing the power that professors have over students, and how that relationship, disguised as love, can be abusive. Throughout the story, we see De Lafontaine's possessiveness of Carmilla. There's no doubt that her closeness to Carmilla is inappropriate. And toxic. Deeply wrong and often uncomfortable. But like. Most of the time, it's taking her to a bar. It's separating her once from Laura. And yes there is the vampire thing BUT the alternative the book proposes is that De Lafontaine kills people instead? At the end of the day, she's kind of just an overbearing parent. One that 3/4 of the way through the book, apologizes and significantly pulls back to give Carmilla and Laura the space they've been asking for.When we're talking about inappropriate/abusive relationships between students and professors, this is not the dynamic that people mean. This isn't to say that her actions aren't wrong, but the book's desire to redeem De Lafontaine and show us that She's Not Actually So Bad makes the 'critique' part of the dark academia feel toothless. Hey guys. Professors can be bad, I guess, but not this one. This one moves across the world because she realizes she was wrong and is so sorry about that, and she didn't get tenure. Lol? (hide spoiler)]On a more personal note, I just wanted more from this story. This is a light 300 pages (the font is huge), and I would've loved to read it for 600. If we're doing the dark academia toxic relationship vampires thing, let's commit! Give Laura and Carmilla room to breathe, let this book be the pretentious love letter to poetry and Massachusetts autumns it so desperately wants - and arguably needs - to be. ST Gibson has spoken at length about how she struggled to write this book, and I think you can tell. I'm almost convinced the straightforward approach was intentional, because it's so at contrast with her other books. But I can't figure out why she would've made this choice. I'm not saying not to read this book or that you won't enjoy it. If An Education in Malice sounds like something you would enjoy, I think it's worth a shot. Having read and loved Gibson's other work, is it a compliment to say I expected better?
5511760674	5 ★ stars. ❛A modern retelling of Carmilla with sizzling hot tension and an addictive lure of dark academia.❜ ▬▬ 💕💌 I can't give you infinity stars so I'm giving you my heart.I suppose this is what a personal handwritten love letter to the dark academia girls who love to drown in the ectasies of pain and the undying beauty of dangerous creatures would feel like. I went through six stages of grief and six more stages of bliss, yet it's not enough to tie up the loose ends of my scattered feelings. I wanted to drop to my knees and weep for how beautiful the story was, like the jewel-encrusted hilt of a sharpened knife. Only S.T. Gibson can write about blood, gore, dangerous love and the seduction of death and make me sick from craving all of them. Her words stir up all kinds of sensations within me that never wear off. A brilliantly crafted, lush and atmospheric, devastingly haunted and tragically romantic page turner that will make you fall in love with the pain and beauty of love.This book has:• Dark academia• The beauty of poetry• Academic rivals to lovers• Sapphic romance • Illicit affairs between student and teacher• Possessive, obsessive love interest• Secrets of vampire society• Blood, gore, murder, mystery❛The story starts with the arrival of a young girl, Laura Sheridan, at Saint Perpetua's, a boarding school for girls, deep in the forgotten hills of Massachusetts.❜ Naive but remarkably brilliant Laura aims to perfect her writing skills in the esteemed professor De Lafontaine's class. As the only first year to impress De Lafontaine enough to be accepted in her class, she gets caught in an intense rivalry with the professor's favorite student Carmilla, who hates to share the spotlight of the professor's attention; but the maddening attraction she feels towards Carmilla is undeniable. Soon she gets pulled into their dark orbit and realizes there's something horribly wrong with the singular interest De Lafontaine has in Carmilla. The more secrets she uncovers, the more she finds herself entangled in the bigger game at play which is impossible to get out of.💌 Laura– (innocent, small-town sweetheart who keeps a dark and wild persona hidden inside).She is our main voice in the story. We stepped into the world of Saint Perpetua's and discovered its secrets through her eyes and it was absolute perfection. I loved being in her head. She was sweet and gentle most of the time, which made it more interesting to witness the flickers of her controlling side and ferocity peek through. You can literally see both sides in conflict till the darkness in her eventually wins out and makes her submit completely to her forbidden desires. She was introduced to a society that shattered all her beliefs and blurred the lines of reality—a big leap from her quiet life—but she took it in so well and managed to keep her humanity intact all throughout it. 💕 Carmilla– (troubled but wickedly beautiful, a constellation of longing and heartbreaks). The whole school knows her as that stuck-up girl with attitude problems—the professor's pet at best. She's bold, daring and carries herself with the confidence of a goddess, but deep inside she is desperate to have her talents acknowledged and to have her affections for the only one she loves returned. She always appears to be in control of everything but she secretly longs to be desired, loved and protected. She was kindling the fire of her unrequited love for the professor when Laura showed up in the picture and wrecked her plans, her feelings, her mind and her heart. She hated her and she loved the way it felt so freeing, that it gave her a distraction to direct her mind somewhere else, even for a little bit.💕💌 They were so Lana Del Rey coded– Lipstick stains on cigrettes, the suffocating tension when eyes lock, fighting and falling in love, kissing in pouring rain, dancing to classics in the living room, skinny dipping under the moonlight, whispering poetries against skin.Okay, I never touched poetry in my life but Carmilla and Laura and their game of seduction got me feeling things. They were everything—dark, delicious, and forbidden. It was like the moment they met, the world and it's rules ceased to exist; they built a world of their own, dark and twisted. They were two lies holding onto a truth with the power of love. Carmilla and Laura both had their individual troubles to deal with but that didn't weaken their connection even a bit. When they say, 'I love you to death and beyond', I think they meant this. 💌 Professor De Lafontaine– (no one writes morally grey characters better than S.T. Gibson). I've never been warned that I'd fall for a 200-year-old or something vampire lady with malicious intentions and questionable motives. She is tender one second and the next I know, she's out there making me question my sanity. She loved obsessively, dangerously; she loved Carmilla in her own twisted ways but you'd never be sure if that's the love of a mentor, a friend, a guardian or a lover. Her niceity scared me more than her cruelty, she kept me on edge all throughout the book but nonetheless an interesting character to get to know.. . .I was familiar with the world this book took place in (mind you, I still lose sleep thinking about 'A Dowry of Blood') so I had no trouble falling in pace with the storyline and once I did, I could hardly put it down. Thanks to Netgalley and Redhook Books for the ARC, I can't wait to have it on my shelf. 10/12
6029872425	➵ 2 ✰- dnf at 50%ok no one is more sad about this than me because this is one of my anticipated releases and i was just so let down. i loved a dowry of blood so maybe i just have really high expectations for this but either way, i was disappointed. i wanted to love this so much but i just felt so bored and had no interest in picking it up. i didn't feel connected to any of the characters and the story itself so i decided to just dnf because i made it to the 50% mark and still had no interest in it.giving it 2 stars because the writing is still great but i just can't i feel so bored 😭# all reviews are opinions of my own and you should experience a book before giving your own. happy reading! 💌₊˚ ────── ୨୧ pre-read ୨୧ ────── ˚₊i got the arc for this awhile back and completely forgot oops but this is one of my anticipated releases this year so i need to 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️hoping i like this as much as a dowry of blood 🤞
5848949470	Ooh, Miss Taylor Swift, the album you could write about this one...“But this girl, this Carmilla… she undid all my domestication”I want to take a moment to convince every bi girl and lesbian reading this review to pick this book up, and I'll start with a few quotes to set the mood.“I wanted nothing more than to be the voyeuristic ghost in the room when she read those poems in her bed at night.”“every inch the creature out of myth in her platform shoes”“Can I confess that I loved it?I loved getting under her skin. I loved knowing that, if I tried hard enough, my words could pierce the armor of her popularity and her persona and disturb something inside her”“ I worked myself into a fever over her, hunched over my typewriter in my dorm room while my tea went cold on my bedside table”“I domesticated my own wildness, starved the odd appetites inside me. ”“What was Carmilla when she wasn’t safely trapped behind the bars of one of my poems?”
5728836030	“Sometimes my poems venerated her like a saint, other times they cast her as the Devil herself, but Carmilla always played a starring role.” my grandmas should have been at the 1968 ivy league dark academy vampire clubs (highkey, that’s what i kept thinking while reading this each time the year was mentioned >.< lol) okay okay, moving on, this was a very highly anticipated new book by st gibson, after a dowry of blood blew everyone’s minds in the previous years. this story is a carmilla reimagining, where we follow laura, while she attends a very prestigious university in massachusetts, where she wishes to study poetry. yet, she soon meets the carmilla of this story when the poetry professor makes them spend more time than just in class together. and then carmilla slowly introduces laura to an entirely different world, sometimes filled with secrets and monsters. yes, this book did let me down, too, but I truly do think a lot of people are being a little too hard on this book. i think the expectations for everyone were just so high because of this author’s debut. but there is still a lot of good in this story, besides just paying good homage to the original sapphic story! i think this also has some good discussions, like inappropriate and manipulative power dynamics. the writing is lovely, and i think ts gibson can craft 11/10 settings and atmospheres. again, we love the queer vampire clubs. we love some pan / bi / attraction to multiple genders rep always. and i truly adored the last page of this book, and it has the exact kind of ending i love. i will always root for girls not wanting to be saints, not wanting to be scared, but wanting to become whatever they want to become in that moment, with power they have always deserved to claim and to have. sadly, i didn’t love this one as much as i hoped, either. the story just never grabbed my attention and the characters never grasped my heart. but i still see the good and i can’t wait to read more from this author, even if this one was not my favorite. author’s note trigger + content warnings: uneven power dynamics, inappropriate relationships between a professor and students, toxic academic environments, blood, gore, murder, consensual sexual content (including public sex), kink (negotiated and spontaneous), alcohol use, drug use, smoking, racist political policies, homophobia, religious discrimination against women.additional trigger + content warnings i wrote down while reading: abandonment in past, vomit / bile, one sentence about animal death in past (kitten), mention of loss of mom in past, self harm imagery in poetry. blog | instagram | youtube | wishlist | spotify | amazonA Dowry of Blood ★★★★
5608517613	An Education in Malice is a reimagining of Carmilla that takes place in the backdrop of an all girls college in the 1960's, where Laura Sheridan has been sent to study poetry and Carmilla is forming an unhealthy bond with her poetry professor, De Lafontaine. We follow Laura and Carmilla as they descend further into a place neither of them can escape. There was truly no way that a vampire book with THREE sapphic poets could be anything less than 5 stars for me, but this book really does excel in so many aspects. Laura and Carmilla are the centerpiece of this book and they are perfection. Even while they are rivals, the tension between them is palpable and it just grows as they become closer. While they are definitely into each other before, the whole vampirism thing seems to accelerate the desire part quite swiftly. I liked how their obsession felt softer and could give way to love, directly contrasting Carmilla and De Lafontaine's relationship. That being said, De Lafontaine really holds this story together. She is an older vampire who is really pushing the boundaries of what is morally acceptable with her students. It's clear she less evil than a product of her own environment, but it's impossible to like her. She shows a different side of love and obsession, one that corrupts and hurts and adds so much to the tension. I love vampire books and I love S.T. Gibson's vampires above all. They are easily my favorite supernatural creatures to read about precisely because of how we see vampires lose or twist their humanity. Similarly to A Dowry of Blood, Gibson utilizes vampirism to discuss abusive aspects of relationships. We see how cruel obsession and power imbalance drives De Lafontaine's relationship with Carmilla and how, while Lafontaine is cruel, she treats Carmilla that way because it is how she was conditioned in past relationships, thus showing how the cycles of abuse can continue in relationships. I am a sucker for dark academia books and, even though the academia aspect is definitely more on the backburner, this is no exception. Gibson does something really beautiful here in making all three of these characters poets. The original poems shared and the existing ones that are studied add an extra layer to the work as a whole. S.T. Gibson's writing is magnificent and atmospheric, sucking you into the story completely. Even after reading A Dowry of Blood (which I highly recommend), this book blew me out of the water. While so many aspects of this book stand out, her writing is by far the best part and, for me at least, the core of why this book is so easily 5 stars. I cannot wait to share some of my favorite quotes (which I'll add in when I have time). Small aside, but it is insanely fitting that I got a Carmilla scented perfume in my literary perfume calendar yesterday. I was definitely smelling that the whole time I was reading this book for the vibes. Thank you Net Galley & the publisher for sending me an e-arc. I am going to go scream into a pillow and smell Carmilla perfume some more.
6199014837	UM HELLOOOOOOO BURY ME WITH THIS BOOK. SERIOUSLY.i know this one has people greatly divided, but this actually changed my dna. no seriously. i had such a great time immersing myself in this story, in carmilla, and in the dark academic background this is set on. listen, if u know me, u know i am the MOST smut-adverse reader ever, it makes me cringe like nothing else, mostly bc i usually cant imagine real men (in straight smut) ever saying the overly sweet things they say in books in real life, but i think i found my cure: SAPPHIC VAMPIRE SMUT. yall... the way i was SWEATING and TINGLING reading this!!! (yeah i know that says more about my bi identity than it does all smut but just walk with me here) i was EATING this UP wishing carmilla would just show up through my window and treat me like shit (and other things) 😩 maybe i should have realised hot mean women are my weakness much earlier, but hey its never too late to learn new things about urself.anyway, this one def wont be for everyone, as a dark academia plot does tend to unravel a bit slower than other types, but the YEARNING, the TEASING is IMPECCABLE. this immediately went into my favorites shelf and miss gibson is officially an author i will pick up everything from.
6132430755	An Education in Malice was a solid vampire novel, but it left me wanting more. Laura Sheridan begins her first year of study at Saint Perpetua’s College. There, she meets the beautiful and mercurial Carmilla, who soon becomes her academic rival. Both girls vie for the approval of their exacting professor, De Lefontaine. Things devolve and get bloody as Laura and Carmilla enter De Lefontaine’s private world. Like A Dowry of Blood, this is a seductive vampire novel. However, this one is loosely inspired by the classic vampire novel Carmilla, which predates Stoker’s Dracula. It is a sapphic romance with dual POVs. I loved Dowry, so I thought this book would be just as gripping, but unfortunately, I just kept waiting for something to happen. I mean things were happening but not with the razor sharp tension or depth of the previous book. I was just left wanting more - more character depth and a deeper look at the themes, i.e., unequal power dynamics and obsession. Still, this is a quick and solid read if you want a story of vampires mixed with dark academia. It has a moody and beguiling feel to it from the first page. The author conveniently provides a list of content warnings.I’m a sucker for a good vampire story, so I’ll definitely pick up the author’s next book if it has them. 3.5 stars.

6221821573	At St. Perpetua’s College for women, the imposing gothic campus has become home to more than just young vibrant minds: Vampires have quietly embedded themselves into the very heart of the school. As you settle into An Education in Malice by S.T Gibson, you are swiftly reminded that not all monsters hide in the dark…they can have the insidious ability to blend into the classroom with you. An Education in Malice is clearly a retelling of the classic horror story of Carmilla by J. Sheridan. Gibson even reuses names from the classic novella for her own characters throughout the book, which cements this literary connection into stone. It is a dark academia novel centered around our two main characters: Laura Sheridan and Carmilla. Both girls are students who rapidly become intellectual rivals with sapphic sexual tension laced into every interaction. Unlike the classic Carmilla’s unhealthy predator/prey relationship dynamic, the relationship that develops between Laura and Carmilla arises from something sweeter, resemblant of two kindred souls finding restful peace with one another. The unhealthy power dynamic aforementioned is instead seen played out in one Professor De Lafontaine, the teacher of Laura and Carmilla’s elitest and demanding poetry seminar. De Lafontaine is beautiful, wickedly smart, and horribly obsessed with Carmilla. This inappropriate fascination with Carmilla snares the girls into a sinister, unholy world where the harm of navigating De Lafontaine’s twisted love may ultimately cost them their own lives—or worse yet, their love for each other. The tangled romantic enmeshments of these characters have the potential to repeat a toxic, tragic history, or alter fated events entirely by trailblazing a new future with love sharply cutting away the decaying rot of the past. S.T. Gibson’s capacity to build a nostalgically familiar, moody atmosphere within her books has impressed me. Even though her books seem to be highly character-driven stories, her ability to weave an immersive, verdant environment around them is remarkable. I have read A Dowry in Blood in addition to this novel by this author and I find that the feel of these books are distinctive in their reading consumption: Dracula’s story in A Dowry of Blood transformed from such painful psychological neglect and entrapment to being an emotionally rich and romantically righteous tale. Markedly, in An Education in Malice, the internal focus is much different. It has a dark, interlocking character predicament rooted in danger, which deteriorates alarmingly fast due to toxic relationship dynamics. And yet, it should also be noted that Laura and Carmilla’s (as well as De Lafontaine’s) love stories are also indulgently unapologetic about choosing your own path regardless of the happiness or misfortune it may bring you. In a way, Gibson is making these horror classics of Dracula and Carmilla more relatable and accessible to modern-day readers by redefining each story with characters and thematic elements woven together in a contemporary way. Open the story of Carmilla and Laura if you wish to see if poisonous, malicious love flourishes…or gets buried deep in the soil at the ever-watchful St. Perpetua’s College. Thank you so much Net Galley and Redhook Books for the ARC and the opportunity to share what I think! All opinions are my own. Publication day for this book will be February 13th.
5381760872	If you want a sapphic, vampires and Gothic rivalries to lovers full of intimate longing... READ THIS!A Education in Malice is a haunting, deliciously Gothic Carmilla retelling that will simultaneously have you giggling, kicking your feet and sitting at the edge of your seat. Set in Massachusetts in Saint Perpetua's College - a desolate, decrepit and ancient estate where secrets fester and life lives among death... we follow Laura who is thrown into a passionate (yet deadly) academic rivalry with Carmilla.A story full of obsession and the lengths one will go to in order to meet their desires, we see the unraveling of dark magic, lust and the pursuit of knowledge, no matter how bloodthirsty. S.T. Gibson's writing is ALWAYS as eloquent as it is astounding and I am constantly left in awe and wishing for an extra 200 pages and it was absolutely no different with An Education In Malice. I was instantly transported to the autumnal gothic estate, dreaming that I could frolic among the danger and fog. The world building and setting were the perfect level of cosy alongside the frightening and it absolutely lived up to its dark academia label.When it came to the characterization, I felt SO MUCH for these characters and found myself adoring both Laura and Carmilla despite their inadequate differences and flaws. When we arrived at their coming together (and their coming apart) I loved the way that S.T. Gibson explored such delicate and complicated feelings all whilst keeping the plot enjoyable and fast paced. The dual POV definitely aided this!And it's absolutely worth noting that chapter 21... PHHEWWWI cannot URGE you enough to pick this up! I have no doubts that this will be one of the biggest books of 2024 and I am already so excited to read what S.T. Gibson does next!rating: 4.75
5180379324	3.5/5 And what do you know of the atrocities I've committed for love? Love is sacrifice. Whether it's you on the butcher's table or not, someone always bleeds. Thank you Little, Brown Book Group UK for providing me with an arc in exchange for an honest review.Unfortunately, I didn't love this book as much as I'd hoped to. I adored A Dowry of Blood and so I believed this would be an easy favourite of mine but, alas, I was a little disappointed.As always, I loved Gibson's lavish prose and the haunting religious imagery used all throughout. The dark academia university setting was incredibly atmospheric and I loved exploring it.I also loved seeing a character from A Dowry of Blood in this book, it made me want to read it all over again! Art outlives all of us. It makes us immortal. What sadly fell flat for me were the characters and relationships (the very driving force of the story).I liked the characters well enough, however I never felt as though I truly connected with them. I also felt that the relationships were strangely rushed, I would've preferred it if this story had been longer and if it'd had more time to flesh out and deepen both the characters and their core relationships.I suppose I wanted a book that was, at least in the beginning, a little more subtle. I wanted to feel the yearning and the pining of this obsessive desire, however I found that these aspects were overlooked and instead rushed into.I also didn't like De Lafontaine's ending as I felt it was too forgiving. I am not the singular voice or opinion you should listen to on this matter, but I did expect and would've liked an ending more similar to A Dowry of Blood. (I am a rage-driven person at my core and I do like that in stories.)I also do want to add that I'm not a big 'spice' reader so I didn't enjoy those aspects of the story as much as I'm sure others will. It was always going to be this way. One of us was always going to bleed for the other. I still very much appreciate Gibson's craft and I continue to find their writing beautiful. I'm just upset I didn't love this as much as I thought I would. I hope others enjoy it more!I can't wait to read Evocation!
5966064558	"She kissed me with a martyr's agonized desperation, like I was the only sword she ever wanted to fall on."Stars: 5+/5spice 2/5Tropes and what to expect: - queer main characters - enemies to lovers - academic rivals- dark academia - poetry- drugs and alcohol- vampires - period piece (1968)This was my first S.T Gibson book but will absolutely not be my last, I was hooked from the first page and it just got better and better as the story went on. This book is poetically smutty, it is luxurious and dark.Our lovely main characters Laura and Carmilla pull you right into the story. They are convincing, realistic and beautifully flawed people. Their personalities are so different while also allowing them to fit together as love interests quite well. This is definitely an opposites attract situation in the best kind of way. The dark academia setting of this book was described so beautifully that I could really envision the world that S.T. Gibson created for this story. Lots of dark gothic buildings and pretty college dorms, an interesting juxtaposition where everything felt so old and yet not at the same time. S. T. Gibson also took a lot of care in describing what all of the characters were wearing, and their wardrobes were so nice, I might have to take some inspo from a few of them. The most unique aspect of this book and my favorite part was just how poetic S. T. Gibson was. Both Laura and Carmilla are poets and it really shines through with the way the describe themselves, as well as people and things around them. This is most prominent in their love story, the way they describe each other is absolutely captivating. I could not stop highlighting lines in this book because they were just so pretty. If you like vampires, sapphic love and dark academia then this is absolutely a book to pick up in 2024. Thank you Netgalley for my ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
5914495333	2.5 stars rounded upMixed feelings on this one. An Education in Malice is supposed to be dark academia and sapphic vampires, which I was very excited for. But it's the sort of book that had the potential to be amazing and instead is just fine.It does deliver the sapphic vampires fairly well, though I found the dark academia element to be lackluster. The school is shallowly developed, mostly set dressing for the three main characters and unrealistic in how things actually function. The sense of atmosphere is much better in the latter half of the book, but the first part is pretty bland with a lot of telling rather than showing and infodumps. I pushed past being very bored and there was a bit of a payoff though not as much as wanted. Conceptually, I like how this is taking a more classic look at vampires in terms of power, seduction, danger, and sensuality. But while it hints at these larger questions of power dynamics, desire, informed consent, the interplay of religion and sexuality etc. But it never really goes anywhere with them and the ending is neatly tied up in a bow which isn't what I want from a book like this. For me this was okay, but disappointing compared to the book might have been. That said, I will try the next book from Gibson because I loved Dowry of Blood and this had some really excellent scenes scattered through the narrative. The audio narration was a mixed bag. Laura's perspective does a southern accent pretty well, but Carmilla is supposed to be from Europe and that accent is patchy at best which was sometimes distracting. Otherwise, the narrator was fine. I received an audio review copy from NetGalley, all opinions are my own.
7193041997	“If you’re the one that does the killing, you guarantee that no one else will ever take what you love from you,”🩸“I’ve always had the strangest instinct to run towards whatever is hurting me, to bare my neck to any predator that caught my scent, and that instinct was even stronger in times of crisis.”🥀I loved “An Education of Malice”! I knew I would because S.T. Gibson’s writing style always pulls me in. This Carmilla retelling had me completely hooked—I fell in love with the characters, and the prose was stunningly beautiful. Gibson scratches every itch I have for gothic romance, transporting me to another world every single time. It’s dark, vampiric, and absolutely everything I adore.♥️I love how her books have such a Dracula-esque vibe, which makes them even more immersive for me. It was also so cool that Magdalena made an appearance in this book—one of Dracula’s brides from A Dowry of Blood!🖤This was also my first sapphic romance that didn’t give me the ick. It was haunting, passionate, and masterfully written. If you’re a fan of gothic stories and vampire tales, this is a must-read!🧛🏾‍♀️👭🩸🥀

6207897010	4.0 StarsThis was such an engrossing piece of dark academia. I am a sucker for the details of classroom life. I soaked up the details of class schedules and teacher lectures.As a retelling of Camilla, I don't feel qualified to comment on those aspects. I have never read the work and only know the surface level synopsis of this work. This work really stands on its own. The prose was quite strong. The narrative felt lush and decadent. I would highly recommend to readers who love dark academia. Disclaimer I received a copy of this novel from the publisher.

Their relationship grows from great disdain to great lust, where their immediate attraction is soon unable to be denied. The girls’ poetry professor Evelyn De Lafontaine, ensnares Carmilla as her prized pupil, which quickly turns to an incredibly dangerous relationship. Much to Laura’s dismay, she then drags her beloved into the ghastly underworld of vampires. Now the girls in their ruthless devotion towards each other & their pursuit of knowledge, dive deep into this sinister dark world where death is considered a welcomed companion. Laura & Carmilla navigate their toxic interpersonal relationships, mysteries and their new insatiable appetites for each other. What I adored: The dark-vampire-academia vibesThe relationships between professors and students & how professors can often hold institutional power that they use for their own benefit is a genre I have yet to encounter. Now mix that in with VAMPIRES and I’m sold! I loved the power dynamics (even though wildly inappropriate) & of course, the scholarly rivals to lovers are always fun to read! The competition between our two main characters was so fierce it was what had me hanging in there to not DNF. Spicy Spicy SPICY!🌶️Is it hot in here or is it just Laura & Carmilla? Damn. Laura discovering her sexual preferences & exploring her kinks was genuinely the only relatively interesting aspect to read. What I disliked: Storyline more like FLATLINEI angrily read this book & wanted it to be over! This book had no pulse. (get it vampires? lol). The storyline lacked serious depth & felt vastly unimaginative. An Education in Malice was more character-development based, but even then they felt shallow. Overall, the plot felt lazy & disappointing. Nothing *that* eventful happened that sucked me in wanting to read more. Childish dialogueJust awful. The writing was not descriptive nor engaging. I felt so bored by our characters’ inner monologues or simply conversing with one another. It was inconsisently messy & repetitive. If you’re gonna go gothic vampire dark academia murder mystery PLEASE COMMIT!! That is all. 🙃﹋﹋﹋﹋﹋﹋﹋﹋﹋➳ 𝚄𝚙𝚍𝚊𝚝𝚎: 𝟸.𝟸𝟽.𝟸𝟺I’ve heard mixed reviews on this, but it’s been staring at me for weeks on my bookshelf👀💀
5635989278	Love the fact its lesbian vampires.. and not a bunch of men.
5602994661	I just read An Education in Malice by ST Gibson and here is what I thought about it:…I did not like this book and I am devastated by that. I was looking forward to this more than almost any other book this year. Lesbian vampires in a toxic poetry cohort? It is like the premise was Made. For. Me. How could it possibly flop? The GoodBefore I really dig into this, I will say that I can see a world in which a particular kind of reader enjoys this book. I think if you are brand new to “dark academia” and have absolutely nothing else to compare it to, this could be for you. I think the loose (and I mean extremely loose) connection to Carmilla holds this book together. So, go for it. Beyond that, I thought the cameo from ST Gibson’s very good first book with Orbit, A Dowry of Blood was fun. I liked the antagonist of this book for the first half until the book absolutely absolved her of all of her bad behavior… and that it. The BadThis book felt like an unedited first draft. The writing was a mix of over written and under written. It felt like the author was struggling to get the story on the page (which is fine, that happens) so to compensate, completely overwrote atmospheric descriptions and visuals that never paid off in any noticeable way. In turn, everything else felt underwritten, underdeveloped, and underbaked. The characters were flat with very little personality or internal motivations outside of obviously reacting to the plot structured around them. They felt like archetypes more than they did characters for most of the book. The dialogue felt like 80% of posts from 2012 Tumblr. The *angst* and *emotion* was absolutely unbearable. Here is just a tiny example:“I am not being hysterical. Hysteria is a made-up tool of patriarchal oppression. You know that?”It’s almost like the scene surrounding this quote was set up for the delivery of that line to show just how “super-feminist” this woman at a girl’s college is. I get that the characters are young women discovering themselves and that that whole process is awkward and difficult. But the writing should make you feel engaged in that process. The cringe should be nostalgic and critical. At the very least you, the reader, should believe that these characters feel this desperately engaged in their own lives and craft that it is admirable to a certain extent. Right? Instead it feels like opening your own Tumblr from 2012 and praying that no one anywhere ever finds your old entries.Speaking of 2012 Tumblr… the poetry in this book was horrendous. You cannot expect me to believe one of the main characters was hand-picked to join a special program alongside a handful of other girls based on the quality of her poetry. I know there were *other* reasons, but there is absolutely no way, even if it was a cover for other nefarious purposes, that other people would believe it. The poetry was insufferable. I felt embarrassed reading it. “Poetry was the only anecdote to my temper.”Really? Can you show me that instead of just saying it and writing a godawful 6 lines filled with the most obvious metaphor and imagery that it made me put the book down and not pick it back up for 2 weeks? I know I am being harsh, but if the parameters of the book depend on the characters’ mastery and participation in a particular field, then I do expect some research and imitation of that field to make the story believable. Another part of this book I didn’t enjoy was the romance—which was supposed to be a rivals to lovers exploration. I felt the depiction of the relationship was unrealistic in a bad way. The transition from rivals to lovers was too quick and the book didn’t have much to say about their relationship within the structure of their environment nor had any additional commentary about their sexual repression before and after the development of the relationship (which we are TOLD is a big part of the book, but again it never FEELS important). The overarching themes that dark academia does well like the exploration of abusive power structures, the boundaries and harm established by the colonialism and/or patriarchy, the conflict over the rejection and desire of pretentious classism… nothing. nada. If it was mentioned it was quick and abandoned just as quickly. All this is to say, why the hell didn’t this book get any help? Where were the developmental edits? Where were the line edits? Didn’t this frontliner at Orbit get any help at all? It kind of felt like they were banking on the success of this being marketed as a follow up to ADoB and just wrote it off. It’s too bad. I wanted to love this and it will probably go down as my most disappointing reading of 2024. Regardless, I still plan on checking out ST Gibson’s Evocation with Angry Robot. Maybe a different team will actually put effort into developing the bones of an interesting concept. 2.25/5
5603341154	If you are familiar with her previous work, A Dowry of Blood, you will know Gibson creates gothic atmosphere, intimate longing, and romantic danger with such attention that you are lured into her beautiful writing and layered characters. Dark fascination, deep and dangerous devotion, uneven power dynamics, haunting intimacy, toxic academic rivalry - all themes Gibson draws attention to in an evocative short book that draws blood. *wink*I don’t want to give too much of the plot away because I think this is the type of book you should go into blind and just know it plays into what you might be familiar with from her earlier book - A Dowry of Blood. This has to be one of the best dark academia settings I have read. Gibson’s writing style lends perfectly to this dark yet alluring genre and the inclusion of poetry taunts you with haunting connections. ”Right and wrong don't exist, Laura. They're fairy tales made up by priests and parents. There is only art and ugliness, and I'm willing to suffer any indignity for the sake of art.”Also, as a side note, I’m currently studying queerness in my English degree and the signals and hints I inferred through that lens astounded me and opened me up to a new way of reading. Dyke hands, the ambiguity of poetry, immortalising youth, smoke blurring boundaries, jasmine flowers… Heck, the names Carmilla and Sheridan!Why not 5 stars?I think because sometimes the language and content felt too indulgent for me. Kind of like a fan fiction of lesbian longing and ecstasy. The sexual content also is something that is not to my personal taste, but again this is more an individual preference. They'd always been with me, these hungers. As a child I played villain in every game of "capture the princess"…Thank you to Orbit for providing an arc in exchange for a review!Bookstagram
5327444907	perfect dark academia x sapphic vampire vibes😍 & the Dowry character cameo!!
5892631398	I loved this book! I was living for the dark academia gothic themes! Sapphic, vampires and poetry! Obsessed I do wish it was longer and we dived deeper into De Lefontaine and her sire/lover, the way it is written leaves options for Gibson to write a prequel or a sequel…I would be interested in both please The academic rivals to lovers sapphic tension was done perfectly. Even the obsession Camilla had with De Lefontaine was intense and intriguing.It was also nice to see Magdalena from A Dowry of Blood featured
7583372507	Para empezar, creo que hacía mucho tiempo que no leía una historia tan inigualable, distinta y, en cierto punto, incluso ortodoxa en su enfoque. Tiene algo oscuro, elegante y provocador que la diferencia de cualquier otra lectura reciente.La pluma de S.T. Gibson fue creciendo a medida que avanzaba la historia. Al principio, reconozco que me costó un poco entrar en ritmo; sentía que no conectaba del todo, que algo me alejaba del centro. Pero después de unos cuantos capítulos, todo cambió: encontré ese algo que me atrapó y ya no pude soltarlo hasta llegar al final.Y hablando del final… OMG, ¿qué? Siento que como lectora tuve la oportunidad de decidir qué creer, cómo interpretarlo, cómo concluirlo. No quiero decir mucho más para evitar spoilers, pero fue impactante, inquietante y totalmente inesperado.La historia está ambientada en un entorno gótico y oscuro: Santa Perpetua, una academia para señoritas donde conocemos a Carmilla y Laura, dos alumnas que no se soportan, compiten constantemente, especialmente en la clase de poesía de la enigmática Señorita De Lafontaine, y cuyos caminos se cruzan más allá de lo académico. Carmilla mantiene una extraña relación con la profesora, una conexión que Laura no puede ignorar y en la que poco a poco termina sumergida hasta quedar completamente atrapada.Hay marcas de dientes, obsesión, fascinación y una tensión constante entre el deseo, el poder y lo prohibido. Las dinámicas entre las tres mujeres son retorcidas, magnéticas, y van desarrollándose con una oscuridad deliciosa. Lo gótico no es solo estética, sino esencia: lo sobrenatural acecha desde las sombras. Porque sí, las criaturas de la noche existen, y en Santa Perpetua hay una que se esconde entre sus muros… más peligrosa y antigua de lo que cualquiera puede imaginar. Y ellas tres deben hacer algo antes de que sea demasiado tarde.
5873296287	It took me a few days to ponder about this book, and I've come to the conclusion that it doesn't deserve 5 stars just because it's not A dowry of blood. The magnificent jewel ceaseled and carved into every word, every syllable meticulously pigeonholed into the perfect place, with the perfect prose, to tell the terrible story of Constanta.I'm way too fond of that casket of precious words to see anything ever matching and comparable, but nothing will ever be A dowry of blood.That said, An Education In Malice is another brilliant twist out of ST Gibson's pen and to quote the author: 'Everything she says sounds slightly conspirational'.Gibson has a magnificent prose, everything she writes is evocative, poetic, feral and dense. It's always multilayered, full of lush, tension, brutality and intention.I still find it a brilliant match between her words and the vampire figure, she never forgets about the blood and the lush involved, while she moves through complicated territories within her themes. And I LOVE IT. Absolutely!Plus, her books are one-sitting-reads: you drink them, you don't read them.An education in Malice is everything the premises says: a gothic dark academia, enemies to lovers, a Carmilla reimagination, a sapphic story. And it's everything these few keywords won't tell you.Its the story of Laura, freshly enrolled in the prestigious Saint Perpetua's College. She is one the few lucky students to attend the famous poetry course by Miss De Lafontaine. There she meets the prodigy and protégée Carmilla, a brilliant talent devoted to the professor and extremely competitive. Well, she was bored before Laura arrived, but now she has competition and nothing will stop the two of them from becoming enemies. Who's the best poet? Who gets the most of De Lafontaine's attention?This competition turns into so much more and it unveils so many secrets and terrible truths.'Unless keeping us starved for her approval, fighting over scraps of her love like neglected puppies, had always been her aim.'Laura and Carmilla alternate povs were great to introduce you into their minds and their rivalry. And Carmilla's scenes were extremely uncomfortable, because what she has been through can only end with violence and pain. I just felt like i needed a bit more time in her mind and I would be completely sold to her. Laura is also quiet interesting, because as much as she's the devoted and more diligent student, she's quite affermative with her essence, she's very determined and that was the only kind of sparring partner I would see standing up to Carmilla.'That she was bringing us deeper into her world not out of the goodness of her heart, but as some sort of punishment. The thought sent a shudder up my spine.'The themes of devotion and the relationship with the master is very complicated and the mess it creates reverberates through the two main characters. They are not blameless, they are not perfect, they just end up in a game that is bigger than both of them. The sensual elements of the books are perfect in the context, since they give another layers to the skein of feelings and abuse. I don't find many authors capable to do that. 'Love is sacrifice, Professor. Whether it’s you on the butcher’s table or not, someone always bleeds.'Thanks to Netgalley for providing an ARC.
5605151238	This book tried so hard to be something it wasn’t. Let’s start there, this wasn’t:- A period drama where the time in history was respected. I think this was the 60-70s? They could’ve let this be 2019 with the way there was practically zero historical context other than the mention of a vinyl album release and civil rights. There’s literally one black girl in a time when I don’t think integration in most colleges was a thing? And if it was in New England, everyone loved her and treated her like besties? Especially this southern white belle MC? And this main character just so happens to visit this black girl’s home during break and learn about this black girl’s family ties to the Black Panthers? In what world is that common? The book treated her as a token of sorts and it was lazily done. All pale skin here and white professors but here comes the happy black best friend for what?- A genuine study of southern vs northern cultural differences. I don’t know why the author felt that every trope was necessary for Laura to fall into except ONE, other than that it was convenient. In every other way, her character didn’t make sense. Two mentions of God and it’s only at the end she mentions going regularly to confession? And confessing to things she had no real qualms with the entirety of the book? There was no epiphany — so why drop that in as a “by the way I’m not religious but I religiously confess things I see as sins to a catholic priest” moment? Why should this matter to us so late in the game? This could’ve been used as a device for self-reflection throughout the book as she “matured” but it just wasn’t used at all. You’d think a catholic would’ve had thoughts the entirety of the timeline.- A proper sexual awakening. Are you kidding me????? Her internal monologues about taste and kink seemed so misplaced and insincere. “I’m sweet and innocent but I also daydream about dominating my classmates” and yet she has no real backbone. You’re a modern day dom reading Victorian p*rn for inspiration and yet are very much a virgin? I don’t know, if this had been explored as her introduction into deviance or darker themes, and didn’t introduce her as an expert on these things, I would’ve believed her more. The “debut”? Really?? This scene made me so angry. Why did Laura have to be a virgin if that wasn’t going to be treated or considered? I thought they were gearing up for some “only virgin blood” scenario but NOPE. Just someone’s first sexual experience in front of a whole crowd? Someone who’s easy intimidated by a sassy classmate would join an orgy? Lol right. The spice seemed performative and lacking in power and common sense. - A mature glance into power dynamics. Should’ve known college freshmen as baby doms would turn out this way. This backed away from the real dom/sub dynamics that would’ve made this richer in depth and more believable. Even if it couldn’t be in name, they didn’t employ any real mind play, just manipulation. Not even a sexy cat and mouse game of chase, just moody and petty ambiguity wrapped up in lust that didn’t even seem passionate or carnal. It really seemed like two adolescents parodying a grown-up relationship and failing at it.I found myself rolling my eyes at the lack of purpose driving the professor’s insistence in studying and being the best at poetry. I’m supposed to believe that barely-adults know what it means to want to leave a mark just for the sake if it? There’s no scholarship, internship, job, fellowship, or fortune driving this incessant study — just a teacher who doesn’t seem to be published or famous — only captivating? I don’t think the reader is ever convinced of why poetry should matter this much, why someone would move entire COUNTRIES for it. Just seemed like a shallow academia trope to grasp onto. Like they were at a point where failing other classes was okay as long as poetry persisted?The professor’s inconsistencies really ruined it for me too. Overly protective and yet puts her prized possession DIRECTLY in harm’s way? Beats her down? Alienates her and crosses boundaries but then has guards up to avoid the same being done to her? Wants Camilla all to herself but then gets mad when she INVITES in another person? Stokes competition and then blames them for existing? And the orgy, really? But you draw the line at kisses because you’re her “teacher” but blood doesn’t count? Like, wow this was so annoying. Another reason why I don’t understand what was really in it for Camilla other than gaslighting and attention from someone who didn’t even seem to value her. There were so many invisible, unfair expectations that weren’t wrapped up in love, just malicious confusion on purpose. And we’re supposed to respect this person as a mature figure? She seemed the most driven by emotion, honestly.This read like new adult, lacked any real sexiness that vampires tend to inspire, and started every sentence with “I”. Safe to say, “I” didn’t enjoy this one bit.
6152333013	4⭐️ This book is my Roman Empire. It was written for the lovers of all things gothic, the creampuffs who are now adults, and people obsessed with vampires. I’ve read so many Carmilla retellings & watched many more that at this point it takes something I adored to stand out. This adaption was both so incredibly different whilst remaining true to the feel of the original book. Without giving spoilers it’s gritty and spicy, dark and eerie whilst being so incredibly romantic in a slowburn rivals to lovers kind of way. Rep// Plus sized Lesbian MC, Sapphic MC, Lesbian SC, Queer SCs. Relationship featured is WLW, though there is one group sex scene involving two women and a man. Thank you to Orbit for sending me a copy for review!TW’s listed below, please skip if you don’t want vague spoilers. Tw// gore, blood drinking, sex, group sex, public sex, kink (including binds and edging), alcohol and drug use, smoking, inappropriate relationship between student & professor (no sex etc.)
6203559062	An education in malice is a deliciously gothic dark academia book. If you were a fan of we were villains or The secret history I would recommend giving this one a go. We have two students battling for the attention and approval of a professor, dripping with lust, jealousy and subtle vampirism. It is dark, obsessive, sapphic and highly character focused.

5874625883	ARC received for an honest reviewwell, that was a book alright. i cannot say it was good but i also cannot say it was bad, which is weird for me after reading a Gibson book because it's usually definitive knowing how clean the plot is and how beautiful the writing style is.here, i feel that the book lacks direction. it did not know what it wanted to be so the book was quite aimless for a while, vacillating between toxic obsessive relationships and dark academia with murder on the side. i get that Gibson was trying for a blend of both but it did not feel like that because the plot progression was poorly paced and if there was focus on one aspect, the other elements were neglected. as a result, the resolution felt too sudden and the ending was anticlimactic. it hurts me to say this, especially because i loved A Dowry of Blood, but this was quite boring, and a dry derivative of the classic Carmilla. it lacked the excitement that usually comes with these kinds of stories and i'm also very confused how Gibson fumbled this bag because i know that they are perfectly competent to execute this concept well and effectively. yet in this book, the full potential of the concept was wasted. i think the root of all this is the rushed development of the relationships. the characters were flat as there was little effort put into the establishment of their own distinct voices, so the main characters moved passively compared to the enigmatic Mrs. D. the way i see this is that Gibson might have been too excited to get into the meat of the story that she neglected the fundamentals of good characterization and proper plot progression. the writing was brilliant and the atmosphere was amazing, as expected, and the gothic and religious aesthetics went crazy, so i can easily look past this mediocre output from Gibson and move on, especially when one of my favorite characters from A Dowry of Blood made a special appearance here.tldr, it's unexpectedly dull coming from Gibson but it's an alright book! not bad but can't say it was good either because the character developments were rushed. the writing, atmosphere, and aesthetics were perfect though so if you're in for that then go ahead and read this book!

5852763200	Sincere thanks to Little, Brown Group UK, Orbit Books, and NetGalley for an ARC of “An Education in Malice” in exchange for an honest review. S.T. Gibson’s “An Education in Malice” was just okay. I liked it, and I have no real complaints or gripes with it. It just didn’t impress me as a dark academia enthusiast. Don’t get me wrong– this book is ideal if you’re looking for a vampiric dark academia book that builds on the themes explored in “A Dowry of Blood” i.e. codependency, abuse, youth, individualism and interpersonal relationships. But I found that every prominent selling point of the book barely dipped below the surface. From unhealthy sapphic relationships to the toxicity of prestigious academic institutions to vampirism as a metaphor– all of these elements could have been explored with more depth or been given more emphasis in my opinion. I enjoyed “An Education in Malice” as an homage to “Carmilla” and as a unequivocal portrayal of how power imbalances turn nasty even when a man isn’t the least involved. But I found this sequel a little lackluster overall. We’ll see how I feel about “Evocation” and let’s hope I like it more!
7272094445	Este libro me ha dado exactamente lo que quería: vampiros, dark academia, obsesión enfermiza y un romance sáfico. Aun así, esperaba un poco más.
5448896692	A queer vampire story that made me regret and wonder why I didn't read Carmilla!A few months back I thought, this is the second of A Dowry of Blood, a vampire tale, dark, old and fatal.ButAn Education in Malice is not set in historical and dark times, does not have spooky air, gothic theme and dangerous men.It isLaura, Carmilla and Professor De Lafontaine's toxic relationship at Girls Saint Perpetua's College in Massachusetts.It was short, worth reading and I do not regret reading it but too far away from S.T. Gibson I knew in plot and characters.Many thanks to Little, Brown Book Group UK via NetGalley for ARC. I have given my honest review.
5702263067	Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.Saint Perpetua's College is isolated and ancient. The girls who study there are close-knit but do they also close ranks to outsiders or will newcomer, Laura, find a new home there?She makes acquaintances but struggles to feel properly understood anywhere other than in the classroom of her demanding poetry professor, De Lafontaine. She finds Laura a promising student and a rival to further the brilliance of her star pupil, Carmilla. The two girls begin an intense academic rivalry but soon their studies are all but forgotten as new discoveries are made and they must face them together or perish alone.The dark academia setting and focus are more than just mere backdrops for the tale to play itself out upon and Gibson has put some real thought into delivering her characters into an authentic setting and with some actual classes being attended. Too often do I see this fail to happen but here I could really feel that they were not only college students, but as gifted and passionate about their studies as the professor stated them as being.I think it is a testament to the author's ability at crafting these aspects that I could have enjoyed reading about them and nothing more, so brilliantly was this academic world created. Pretty soon, however, supernatural entities began to appear and a more gothic focus uncovered.The truly sensual nature of the writing lent itself well to the appearance of vampiric entities and I adored the nods to classics featuring these creatures, that appeared throughout. The link between lesbianism and vampires in fiction has long been noted and I even studied a course upon it whilst at university. Previously, both had been demonised but here there was merely a connotation created. Also, surprisingly, a light and innocence arrived into the novel as these romantic relationships were explored. They played out amidst this backdrop of gothic beauty and alongside the appearance of night-time entities. This entire novel was full of Sapphic beauty, gothic creations, and some of the most glorious writing that I have ever had the intense pleasure of reading. A truly brilliant read!I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you to the author, S.T. Gibson, and the publisher, Orbit, for this opportunity.

The writing was poetic, the characters were so beautifully flawed that they felt unnervingly real. I immersed myself in this book and finished it within 2 days. The story follows the FMCs, Carmilla and Laura as they navigate the world of poetry and academia. There is angst, tension, obsession (with drops of possession), internal conflicts of self-identity, and lustful desire.🥵 The plot is driven by horror/mystery undertones that kept me intrigued until the end. "This. This was living. Coaxing the death out of another person, bringing them right up to the brink, but refusing to push them over the edge."** A more in-depth RTC as the publication date gets closer.

6672616795	Мене засмучує рейтинг цієї книжки, бо він не відображає загальної картини. Можливо, це і не 5 stars read, але це надзвичайно атмосферна, готична, гарно стилізована і чесна дарк-академія. Про вампірів, ага. Персонажі теж доволі симпатичні. Декаданс, суперництво між студентками-поетками, дивні уроки на хаті у професорки, темні таємниці, бібліотеки, квір-любовні лінії (дві - тут практично нема персонажів чоловіків, хіба епізодичні), відчуття суму за втраченою людяністю і згаяною молодістю - ось за чим я сюди прийшла, це я і отримала. Певно, інші люди прийшли по ретелінг - і це, на мій погляд, не він. Від Кармілли Ле Фаню тут хіба імʼя і походження персонажки.Щодо сюжету - трохи смішно, що авторка в інтервʼю казала, що вона не думала від початку робити pov Кармілли, але потім переписала всю книжку, додавши її, а я це я вважаю якраз основною проблемою сторітелінгу, бо сюжет весь викладається одразу, нема жодних таємниць і моторошних очікувань, саспенсу. Тож якщо ви не по вайбу, а по вотетоповоротах, вам не сюди. Всім іншим рекомендую.
6006326297	I received an eARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review!Alright, I have a lot of thoughts… At the very beginning I was quite excited, as I love the original Carmilla and (most of) its retelling, but as I progressed throughout the book, so many things fell completely flat on their face. There were too many instances to count where the plot simply wasn’t making sense anymore, dialogue felt awkward (dead), or a theme introduced was completely dropped and then picked back up again. I have a slight bone to pick with calling this a Carmilla retelling/reimagining as there wasn’t much calling back to the original Carmilla other than the characters and vampirism. Even with the characters from the original source, it felt like this was just using their names and nothing about the actual characters. Laura’s flip flopping between “innocent southern girl” and “completely domineering powerhouse” both gave me whiplash and confused me, primarily due to the fact that Laura’s character simply isn’t like that. A similar sentiment with De Lafontaine and Carmilla, both felt much out of character for what was trying to be accomplished. And the odd choice to attempt a critique/condemnation on student/teacher relationships? Fell far too flat for what I assume was trying to be attempted. Carmilla and Laura’s rivalry felt half baked at best and if I stuck a toothpick in it, the toothpick would come up all gooey and make you feel sad inside. Now, I normally love a good “enemies to lovers” but when the buildup is so… lacking and one half of the novel they’re at each others necks, fighting for the attention of their professor, and then the next half they suddenly find comfort and solace in each other, it’s a bit hard for me to get into. Again, the out of character-ness of it all is my BIGGEST gripe. If you’re going to retell a story, please, for the love of me, make the setting, actions, and behavior of the characters and how they fit into the overall story make sense.Reading this was like watching a car crash. I wanted to stop but I just couldn’t. If I had to lay my eyes on the words “slick folds” one more time I fear I would have gone insane. (This also read like a wattpad fic lol)0.5/5 stars.
5602458239	Rating ~2.5 ✨UNPOPULAR OPINION INCOMING✨I had such high expectations for this book, too high perhaps. It wasn’t necessarily bad. I simply found myself waiting for the magic and allure I experienced with A Dowry of Blood to take hold. Alas, that never happened. I’m not sure if it was the setting or the characters, but something never quite clicked. The romance also wasn’t anything to write home about either. It was simply…there. I was told they were obsessed with each other and expected to believe this was a couple worth rooting for. I did not believe or enjoy it. The writing style is lovely as is to be expected from this writer. But sadly, I simply didn’t love this book.Thank you to NetGalley and Redhook Books for providing me with an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
5884236965	3.5*? probably? this was a very quick enjoyable read, but it was nothing extraordinary. ST Gibson's writing is marvellous, as always, but i didn't really connect with the story. i loved the relationships between the characters (vampire milf taking care of her token sapphics, what more can i ask for really). the plot left a lot to be desired in my opinion, but my main qualm with this book is the fact that it's set in the us of a ??????? this should've 100% been set in london or something of the likes ??? alas. liked it was okay will definitely think about lesbian vampires for the next week <3 i will need a lestat x louis retelling with carmilla and laura asap
6570077213	DNF @55%I lied! I quit! There are so many better books that I need to read!You know, I didn’t think A Dowry of Blood was fantastic, but I had a fun time. It had some advantages, such as; a) short length, b) brisk pace that was building to a point, and c) the inherently tell-not-show style was somewhat justified by the structure of the book, as it was a story being told directly. Now An Education in Malice, on the other hand… it’s longer, slower, devoid of meaningful tension and set in real time — which makes the “telling” writing style bizarre and excruciating.I’m tired of queer romances that just read like mid fanfiction. Is it too much to ask for romance to be based in meaningful romantic, emotional or sexual tension instead of fanservicey set pieces? This sort of writing fails in an original work, because the fanservice is meaningless when I don’t have a previous attachment to these characters! I say original work, but this technically isn’t — ironically, even though this reads like fanfic, it doesn’t read like one of Carmilla. I’m scratching my head over how you could pull the dynamic of “awkward dom laura and bratty sub carmilla plus their evil professor who pits them against each other” out of that novel. It doesn’t even read like an AU — I suppose the names were picked at random.One last thought — maybe this picks up in the second half (that I couldn’t be asked to read), but the vampire lore is pretty much nonexistent and uninteresting. Really this book has nothing going for it other than its premise, which it mishandles on most levels. Thank you, next.
5889051053	Thank you NetGalley and Little, Brown for this ARC in exchange of an honest review. Not sure if this is 4 or 3.5 stars. This was quite enjoyable and beautifully written. I enjoyed the aspects of academia, poetry and the rivalry between Laura and Carmilla. De Lafontaine was a very intense and intriguing character that added a lot of mystery to the story at the beginning. But that was just the beginning. As the story progresses it loses most of the romantic aspects of academia and poetry and becomes (in my opinion) merely a story about vampires and old grudges. In the second half I was really wondering where the story was going because things were happening off the pages and there was no urgency and no stakes for our two main characters until the second to last chapter. People were dying but Laura and Carmilla where mostly unfazed by it. At the beginning I found them both to be very different and distinctive but both of their POVs started to sound the same after maybe 1/3 of the story. The chapter title always told me who’s POV I’m reading but if I didn’t pay full attention to it both of them sounded the exact same to me and I sometimes had to go back and check whose POV I’m reading. Especially Carmilla lost some of her charms of being this headstrong and quite rude but smart and fierce character which made the distinction harder. Nevertheless I enjoyed the story and really liked the main characters. Even with some of the mentioned points I think this will be a great new entry in the Dark Academia canon.
6065578770	4 stars Dark academia, sapphic, vampires, and beautiful prose. An Education in Malice is a Carmilla retelling and I absolutely loved it.I love S.T. Gibson's writing style. She truly transports you into the world that she weaves on the pages. The gothic imagery in this book was stunning. I read this in audiobook format and I truly think that is why I didn't have a pacing issue with it. I feel like if I had read it physical it would've taken me longer to get through. The narrator did a fantastic job.Vampires always do it for me, and this one was no exception.
5971224085	I don't know how I feel about this book. I wanted to love it, but just ended up liking it. S.T. Gibson absolutely has a talent for story telling. I enjoyed parts of it especially atmosphere but I just didn’t feel a major connection to the characters like did with A Dowry of Blood.ARC kindly provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
6137188707	A beautifully haunting tale of first love set against dark academia. The prose was elegant and engrossing. I really enjoyed this read, a different twist on some familiar tropes expertly crafted to keep you hooked. I received an advanced copy from Netgalley/ all thoughts and opinions are my own
6931832890	An Education in Malice is a dark academia that is part vampire novel, part sapphic romance. When I first picked up this book the only thing I knew about it was that it was about two girls vying for the attention of a brilliant professor. I had no idea there would be vampires and romance too. Laura is a talented, competitive, and pragmatic freshman whose academic rival and obsession, is Carmilla. Carmilla is a stunning beauty whose both talented and haughty. Both girls compete for the attention and affection of the brilliant, beautiful, charismatic, and mercurial professor Evelyn De Lafontaine. Little does Laura know that there's a dark and capricious side to the exceptional teacher. The character and relationship dynamics between the professor and two students was fascinating as well as the relationship between the girls themselves. The girls personalities are juxtaposed in an interesting way with their sexual proclivities. Dual POVs of two very different characters makes for a fascinating look into what each girl is thinking. I absolutely loved this book. It's got some very interesting relationship dynamics between the three characters. There's also vampires and sapphic love, really what more do you need?
6228850432	I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the author's writing style. I would highly recommend this to so many of my friends; I'm certain it's the next dark academia standard. Super lush and enchanting. Horror isn't really my thing, but I think that was so secondary and I was never put off by it. Dual POV is something else I can be picky about, but I thought it really served the story well here and I liked both Laura and Carmilla's characters and as narrators. I was completely enthralled, I sped through this book.However, I didn't feel like there was enough of a resolution of the relationship between Carmilla/Laura/Ms. De Lafountaine. After everything that happened, it felt anticlimatic, and I wish there had been more of a decisive conclusion. Also, I think calling this book a "Carmilla retelling" is doing it a disservice. I've read Carmilla, and this so different (themes of academia and the whole character of De Lafountaine) that goes beyond a modernization can stand on its own.Emily Dombrowski I need you to get on this when it comes out in two weeks🙏 Thank you to NetGalley and Orbit for the advanced copy.
6037359524	3.5 starsI've heard incredible things about A Dowry of Blood and am a huge fan of Carmilla, so when I heard that S.T. Gibson was writing a dark-academia based Carmilla retelling I was over the moon. However, when I realized the book featured a professor x student relationship and polygamy I wasn't sure how I was going to enjoy it. Overall though, it ended up really impressing me, and I think that is largely due to S.T. Gibson's writing style. Admittedly, I found the first third or so of this book to be quite slow, but once the vampire antics picked up and Laura and Carmilla's relationship began I really enjoyed it. I wasn't a huge fan of De Lafontaine's role in the story, but the rest of the story was so good that I couldn't stop reading. Laura and Carmilla's relationship dynamic is quite complex and interesting, and I really enjoyed how S.T. Gibson portrayed it. It also helps that the author's prose is absolutely breathtaking. And while I generally don't care whether the books I read have sex in them or not, S.T. Gibson writes eroticism incredibly well. And not just in the actual smut. I'm talking about the tension and quiet conversations between Carmilla and Laura. I took an erotic literature course in university a couple years ago that had an entire unit dedicated to vampires in erotica, and while I was reading this book all I could think about was my professor's reaction if they read this. Anyway, as I was saying, I had a really good time with this novel, especially the second half. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for some more sapphic romance or vampire recs. Thank you to NetGalley and RedHook books for the eARC in exchange for an honest review!
6043203341	Proper review will be given nearing the publication date. However, I'd like to say that this was unexpectedly an enjoyable read! This modern retelling of Carmilla will bring you to an a rollercoaster ride as we embark on a thrilling, sometimes sinister, journey that takes place in Saint Perpetua's Women's College.Here are the things that you can expect: dark academia, sapphic relationship, secretive society, and vampires. Doesn't that spark your curiosity?My sincerest gratitude goes to NetGalley for providing me with ARC in exchange of honest review.
6165297048	An Education in Malice is more of an education in how to take a YA book, add one scene that makes it ‘naughty’ and then market it as a gothic romance, only to make your readers feel ripped off. Let me tell you do I feel cheated. I expected a sapphic, steamy, vindictive, gothic story; instead I got a mildly sapphic, boring, single scene of voyeurism, vampires with no sexiness or gothic tones snippet. To even call this a story is reaching as the plot is so thin and obvious that it’s hard to say it furthers anything. Additionally the characters are so one dimensional and boring. Literally all of them could have been eaten or killed and I’d have cared less; in fact, in the case of the leading gal I might have been pleased I wouldn’t have to hear her be so dull chapter after chapter. Elements of this story and the characters are lost so many times. Our two leading girls are set-up as certain types of people to start, and then become completely different people, engage in a sort of vampire orgy/viewing party, only to somehow remind us they are the same girls from before. It doesn’t tie together well and ultimately falls apart by the end. I’m very surprised by the love for An Education in Malice as I thought the only well written part was our girl on girl voyeur chapter; which is not near enough for me to say a book is good. I’d like to see less of this ‘scratch the surface’ plot and character development that is sacrificed because of one hot scene. A book can be both complex, character and/or plot driven, as well as sexy! Ask Laurel K. Hamilton for tips. Plus, if you are going to market your book as gothic it needs gothic elements! Vampires on their own are not gothic, it should have a focus on death, life, and a slight obsession with the macabre. Make it dark, thoughtful, and full of gothic imagery. Mary Shelley would have been embarrassed for this to be called gothic. Let’s do her proud and write actually subversive stories that get people thinking and talking. Your gothic romance cannot have just one erotica scene that the rest of the book is written around. Disappointing is an understatement on this one. Please note: I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. This is an honest and unbiased review.
5878733854	ੈ✩‧₊˚ I was never going to possess her, of course. I would never get to taste her skin or hear the sweetness of a moan from her lips. But if I couldn't have the real Carmilla, I would settle for an illusion of my own design. I'm sadly starting to think that a dowry of blood was a one hit wonder for me because the other 2 books I have read from S.T. Gibson have been 3 star reads.This one lacked the atmosphere that I wanted, it had little sultriness and mysteriousness for the vampires and the setting. The "plot" if you can call it that was incredibly weak with the ending feeling rushed and flat. I don't mind books that are no plot just vibes but this had no plot and no vibes...The characters, Carmilla, Laura and Ms D were underwhelming to me, I wanted them to jump off the page with chemistry and tension but instead I felt very little for these characters. I think this book could have been more, should have done more. I love Carmilla, so was incredibly excited for this retelling but unfortunately it seems to be another forgettable read.
6042941406	** spoiler alert ** *spoilers ahead* “An Education in Malice” by S.T Gibson sunk its teeth into me and did not let go. This is the first of S.T Gibson’s works I have read, but will certainly not be the last. One of my favorite things about this book was the writing. Gibson crafts their words in such a way that is utterly captivating. If you find you DNF books for the writing quality, you need not be concerned with Gibson. This book features a dual point of view of two opposing characters. Utilizing a dual point of view in this book was a brilliant choice. I was always looking forward to reading the new point of view, and did not begrudge reading one over the other. Having a dual point of view in this book was absolutely necessary. Both characters needed their stories told to understand the complete picture.This book would be the perfect fall or winter read. A book about sapphic vampires who write poetry is just the dark academia vibes I need. However, there were a few aspects of the book that I disliked. I HATED the character of De Lafontaine and she was not a character I loved to hate. I felt like at some points of the story I was supposed to hate her, and at others I was supposed to love her. Her character was not morally grey to me though. I felt she was just manipulating these teenage girls, and she should have known better at her big age. I also felt that there could have been a slower burn. It felt like the characters went from enemies to lovers very rapidly, with little context to elaborate the change. I didn’t really feel much of a spark between them. I was not convinced that they really loved one another.Thank you to Net Galley and Redhook Books for the ARC in exchange for an honest review!
6028750226	What a way to start 2024, “an education in Malice” is the perfect book in a lot of senes. “I had always so loved being loomed over, especially by beautiful people.”-5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The story is about a girl named Laura who enters this new all girl school to pursue her love for poetry. Along the way she meets Carmilla and professor de Lafontaine and everything becomes interesting. I love the writing style of this book so much, it was so poetic and beautiful I think I annotated and wrote at least a dozens of qoutes. I loved all of them throughly, I loved Carmilla with her brilliant mind and her eager soul. I loved Laura and her books and her passion. I even loved De Lafontaine, for who she was. For how misunderstood she was. Im very glad I got to pick this book as an ARC, and a huge thanks to Net Galley for providing me with one. Because I dont think it was my typical go to book and otherwise I might have never read this beautiful and enchanting story. ✨
6648647121	This book is seeping with poetic prose, sapphic lust, gothic atmosphere and blood. A must read if you enjoy vampires and academic settings. “I kept my tastes quiet, kept them private, feeding them only rarely and when I was sure I wouldn't get caught. I often felt like a wolf wearing the skin of a girl, balancing on two legs and hoping no one would notice.”I originally read about fifty pages of this book a few months back but found the characters too childlike and annoying to continue. However, I picked it up again a few days ago and I’m glad I did. The characters grew on me as the storyline progressed and I really loved the writing, it’s absolutely stunning and I ultimately ended up devouring this book.
6306540015	** spoiler alert ** Книжка виявилась дуже красиво написана, як і A Dowry of Blood, але без вау ефекту нажаль.

Особливо для мене дуже вайбовим був момент в будинку Магдалени наагдував мені один фільм " Інший світ", доречі саму Магдалену після A Dowry of Blood , якщо це була вона незвично було бачити. Питання До Ізіс коханки Лефонтейн вона якась кончена, так як вона вбивала учениць тільки щоб Лефонтейн до неї повернулась 🙄, момент коли вона прокинулась з могили і мало не вбила Карміллу шокував.Зате кінцівка мені сподобалась як і книжка в цілому.

7997090570	2.5/5 ✩Though not bad, this book really didn't land for me the way Dowry of Blood did. Personally didn't love the way Gibson adapted the Carmilla story, as this felt as if it was barely trying to be an adaptation. If this were approached as an original story, I think it would have landed better, because there are aspects that were quite good here.Unrelated to the story itself, I have such high praise for the audiobook narrator - the way that Cannon made every character sound so different had me convinced a few times that there were multiple people narrator this.R.E.A.D.S.

6002797388	⭐⭐ Check out more of my opinions on Enemies to Lovers books on my blog Enemies To Lovers Source ⭐⭐The rating I'm giving here is quite subjective because different folks might have different takes on it. Similar to some of my less enthusiastic reviews, I want to unpack why this particular book didn't resonate with me but could very well strike a chord with others.An Education in Malice shares the same universe as the highly acclaimed A Dowry of Blood, albeit set many years later. We follow Laura, a college student, who finds herself in an exclusive poetry class where she encounters the beautiful yet haughty Carmilla and the enigmatic, manipulative Professor De lafontaine. Their relationships seem to transcend the ordinary dynamics of a teacher and students, pulling Laura into their complex games.The issue I found with this book lies in its potential for a compelling narrative, which unfortunately remains largely unexplored. It earnestly strives to capture the essence of stories like These Violent Delights (the gay one) but falls short in delivering emotional depth. The attempt at crafting memorable, obsessive, and sensuous prose comes across as a rushed iteration of the "passionate enemies turned lovers" trope without delving deeply into the character's humanity. The stakes feel trivial, lacking genuine character evolution. Laura's swift fixation on the class antagonist and the subsequent immediate intimacy seem contrived.Beyond superficial allure, I struggled to discern a convincing reason for Laura and Carmilla's significance to each other. Their association with the professor also feels forced. The narrative is inundated with excessive longing and obsessive musings, lacking a clear focal point. Wheres the malice? I don't even know. Certainly there are people being rivals (ish) but nothing malicious happens here.While Laura possesses intriguing personal quirks that heighten the intimacy of certain scenes (the sex scenes are FANTASTIC), her lack of depth blurs her distinctiveness when the point of view shifts. Carmilla has slightly more complexity but largely remains a superficial character. Professor De Lafontaine, a pivotal force behind the story's darker and supernatural aspects, emerges as what I can only describe as EXTREMELY ANNOYING, which detracts from the book's appeal. Wrestling with her character becomes taxing due to her pivotal role and desperate desire to be seen as attractive by these much young women and is actually legitimately cringy.When the book was not getting sexual, it was a snore. The school scenes were extremely boring. The "Laura's friends" scenes were not at all engaging- there didn't feel like a point in giving her friends and it added nothing to the plot. The romance scenes were compelling half of the time, and hard to buy the other half. I regularly found myself skimming. The villain was horrendous, like they were written in at the last second because the author forgot that the book needed stakes.I think most folks are coming for the romance and that's what really complicated this book for me. The actual romance was bad if you are going in with expectations of a quality work of fiction. Insta-lust dominates the story and every relationship in it. None of the characters seem to know or understand each other outside reading each other's fetishes, and we have minimal scenes of the girls actually connecting. Gibson Throws in these long emotional monologues about obsession amounts to "trust me bro, they have an intense thing." The tropes are academic rivals to lovers and hatefucking, for lack of a better phrase. Having JUST read A Study in Drowning which is also an academic rivals to lovers dark academia, my bar was pretty high.Heres the thing though- if you are coming at it from a 'trashy romance' angle and drop your expectations to zero, you have a pretty standard horny porn book here, and its at it's best when it abandons any notion of trying to be a real piece of literature and just lets the two slightly more interesting sapphics fuck. If sex and intense emotions are you thing and you don't so much care about how we got here, look no further. I also truly respect the author's willingness to make these queer girlies real pieces of shit. I barely even liked them but at least it was interesting enough to keep reading.An Education in Malice at engaging aspects, particularly in its intimate scenes, yet fails to infuse its characters with the depth required to make their relationships and struggles compelling. The narrative lacks a solid anchor amidst its swirling emotions, resulting in a superficial portrayal of characters and their interactions. There's an opportunity here to be valuable to folks starved for "bad sapphics", but this is yet another example to me of how people will just latch onto anything if it gives them the rep they are looking for. 2.5/5 for me.1 like
