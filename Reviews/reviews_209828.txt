1543281528	Sappho’s lyrical poems are interesting since they often make clear allusions to events in Homer’s version of the Trojan cycle of myth, but the focus is shifted away from the traditional thematic concerns like honour and duty. Sappho places the importance of eros over kleos. In addition, physical pleasure is not derived from domination of her supposed lovers but is instead –at times- a result of their mere presence. And finally, her relationships with other women do not always seem to have definitive “active/passive” roles.the 9th muse!

1779856447	61. Sappho : A New Translation by Mary Barnardwith an introduction and notes by Dudley Fittscomposition: c ~612-570 bce, translation 1958format: 115 page paperback, University of California press, 2012acquired: library read: Oct 9rating: 5 I had three hours to kill in a coffee shop - and The Argonautika, 3/4 done, was NOT calling. I picked this up instead to glance through and was first struck by fragment 6: "I love thatwhich caressesme. I believeLove has hisshare in theSun's brillianceand virtue" That's all it took to get my attention. I thought about it constantly as I read the remainder of the collection over the next two hours. Why? If I tried to tell you, I guess I'd probably ruin it.I'm not going to try to review Sappho's fragments. What you should know is that there isn't much left. In classic times there were nine book of poetry by Sappho, and they were so readily available that authors didn't bother quoting all the time. But that's all gone. What we have now are the various quotations that have been preserved through the ages, and a few gems found on the cloth of burial wraps in Egypt. I think only two complete poems have made it down to us via copies of copies of copies and they have surely been butchered. The quotes are extensive and promising but that is all. And that is mostly what we read - tantalizing fragments that leave us wondering. This little book was a terrific experience for me. Reading enthusiasm just isn't there and it's hard to make a work what it should be. But this came at the right time and place and at the right length, all contained within those two hours. I have several other translations in the house at the moment, care of my library. I hope to read more of them.

2094276307	There is a statue of Sappho located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that I think expressed what Sappho is about perfect:http://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages...She's portrayed as the sort of artist or musician who is both brought to life by beauty and totally consumed by it, which is constantly evident in her poetry. she talks of love and sexuality as a powerful reason to be, but also a thing that annihilates the self completely and renders a person obsolete, useless. 'With his venom/ Irresistible and bittersweet/ That loosener of limbs, Love/ reptile- like/ strikes me down'she talks of love as if its a sort of monstrous thing she is trying to escape because it makes her lose all agency. And I think this is what I love most about Sappho, she values her strength and her independence, she loaths loose limbs, but she understands that to love and be loved is a sort of pleasure that comes at a high price.
1818504406	We know relatively little about Sappho from the island of Lesbos in Greece. Her poetry is not explicitly homosexual despite her name being intimately associated with female homosexuality. That being said there is a delicious sensuality to her writing that transcends time and still can speak to use today. It is full of desire and love and beauty. What I like is how it brings alive the life in ancient Greece. Take for example the fabled Grecian urn which of course Keats wrote about in 1819. Here is Sappho:We put the urn aboard shipwith this inscription:This is the dust of littleTimas who unmarried was ledinto Persephone's dark bedroomAnd she being far from home, girlsher age took new-edged bladesto cut, in mourning for her,these curls of their soft hairHow utterly evocative and melancholic and still unspeakably beautiful. Give Sappho a read and you will not regret it.

I was disappointed by the scenery, the views of the Ohio weren't much different than I can mange on a ten minute walk from our front door. It was a hot summer morning, the insects appeared both bored and determined and somehow despite these circumstances this ancient voice reached me, though a clinging film of 2600 years.
6739458226	"now i know why eros, of all progeny of earth and heaven, has been most early loved"as a bisexual woman when i started to read poetry this year, i knew i had to somewhen finally read sappho. and i'm glad i've read her; it was a gorgeous, tender collection of queer longing and eventual heartbreak (comphet and heteronormativity have been ruining secretyl queer lives since the dawn of time). the translator, mary barnard, seems to have delivered a crystal-clear masterful translation from ancient greek to english (ancient greek is hard asf, i tried and failed), it flowed incredibly well. some poems really hit me personally but i do have to admit that i didn't care of some of them. those i didn't care about were just pretty word to me. for those i did, i found them beautiful, sensual almost erotic for ancient greek standards and it was just lovely. but bcs i'm midway about some poems versus others, i'll give it a conservative 3.5 :) "the gods bless you, may you sleep then on some tender girl friend's breast"
3773000852	(note: this is more of a review of the translation than Sappho's work itself)Mary Barnard's translation of Sappho's poetry is quintessential for reader's of classics; it was the first publication of Sappho to be translated by a woman, allowing her to retain the original feminine voice and views, unlike masculine translations which, consciously or subconsciously, take on a male perspective. She also writes true to the original voice of Sappho, taking away any of the previous embellishments of Edmonds' or Wharton's versions.Barnard also orders the fragments in such a way as to almost create a narrative story; beginning with poems from Sappho's youth, when her narrative voice is young, naïve and passionate, the poems progress to the point of her being older, wiser, reflecting on her life and being on the verge of dying.Yet these translations are originally from 1958, so it's important to keep that in mind when reading; if you are looking to read Sappho for the iconic lesbian themes, (while they are in some cases unavoidable), I would recommend reading a more recent translation, as Barnard chooses to use gendered terms like "boy" while in the original Greek of some poems the subject is gender-neutral/ambiguous, showing the heteronormativity at the time when Barnard was translating.All in all, it's an amazing translation, and I adore Sappho and the themes she explores within her poetry; her work reveals so much about life in Ancient Greece and beliefs at the time, as well as revealing the links between the ancient world and modern society, both in gender, sexuality, emotions, and the human struggle.If you're interested! Here's some further reading I would recommend:Sappho's Sexuality and the gendered terms used in translations (short article) - https://acad.carleton.edu/curricular/...Fighting Lesbian Erasure in Historiography (a short article) - http://manchesterhistorian.com/2020/f...Paideuma: Modern and Contemporary Poetry and Poetics (commentary on this specific translation) - https://www.jstor.org/stable/24726068...
5767256497	Getting a lot of Sapphic vibes from these poems
177399680	I’d be lying if I said that love isn’t one of my favorite subjects.It’s obvious that Sappho is a wonderfully gifted poet. I wish that I could read the poems in their entirety, but sometimes the mystery of what is lost adds to their beauty. Who cannot wonder of what she speaks of in this fragment?:“That was different.My girlhood thenwas in full bloomand you—”This is all we have, but it already speaks bounds of what it means to be young and in love. Reading Barnard’s footnote, I may disagree with some of her methods of translation; compressing the poems where words were missing, for instance. But overall it is a nice little collection, one that I would gladly read again. However, I am super paranoid about reading translations, afraid that I might be reading a poorly translated version of what I should be reading. Barnard’s translation is a good one, but I will probably take a look at Anne Carson’s translation next.

7390048249	It's hard to convey just how much I loved this book. Mary Bernard has managed to take fragments and turn them into a lyrical dream. She didn't do this by spinning poems out of these fragments, but by being straight forward and honest in her lack of certainty. There is something beautiful and wondrous in putting your hands up and saying "I don't know for certain, but I do know that I need to share this with the world". If you have 2 hrs to read and bask in this translation, please do. It is my favorite so far. Bernard truly understands Sappho and 6th century bce Greece in a complex and deeply beloved way.
3445482244	A masterful translation which exceeds others out there quite stunningly!One of history’s great tragedies is how few of her renowned and frequently commented upon works have survived, and that those which did exist in somewhat fragmented form, have been cobbled together off crumbling papyruses, from the Greek. Hence, an eloquent and diligent translator becomes downright essential to bringing what represent some of the most important scraps of writing ever laid down into a language and a format the modern English speaker reader can understand and appreciate. Mary Barnard does that to absolute perfection in this slim, impactful volume, so flawlessly it becomes almost astonishing. I don’t recommend purchasing, but it’s worth just skimming some of the other gobbledegook, essentially unreadable translations of Sappho out there (“If Not Winter”: YIKES) to appreciate just what a feat and accomplishment this artful rendering represents, and what the same material can be misshapen into in less expert hands. Trite as it may sound, Sappho is to poetry what Shakespeare is to drama, Faulkner is to novels, Beethoven is to music. Her work is just that seminal and significant, however, and countless of the most renowned minds and pens have attested to this over the ages since its composition. Each work if very brief, yet surging with electricity and thoughtful intent, with music and feeling and rich, inimitable perspective and lyricism. If it were food, one might equate the sumptuous delicacies within to ambrosia, but need we find a more terrestrial analogy French cuisine comes the closest to describing Sappho’s small, flavorful, hearty little pieces. Peasant food, which nonetheless are capable of excelling beyond anything else you’ve tasted before or shall since. If you have not had the pleasure, you owe it to yourself to take a gander through the Elysian Fields these pages evoke. A perfect gift this could also make for a cherished friend or family member, especially mothers, sisters, daughters, young woman finding themselves and grappling with marriage, growing up, childbearing, and other timeless subjects addressed within confidently with humor and audacity!
2071339839	When I was younger I read a lot of poetry and fell deeply in love with the lyricism of it all. I fell out of the habit of reading it, for what reason I do not know, but as luck would have it I befriended a beautiful poet and lover of the craft. She leant me a variety of books of poetry, among which was this one. Sappho I've heard about a great deal, but never actually read. This book was, while a great introduction to her poetry, also a great introduction to the mystery of the woman behind it. So little is known of Sappho, and so little of her poetry has survived intact... but her reputation remains, and indeed is held up by what bits of her poetry we have. The woman was a master poet.The poetry herein is a sort I've not really seen before. Stripped of all the superfluous flowery language that poetry is often characterized by, what is left is the barebones of expression that somehow seem to carry within them even more weight still. The fragments are oddly beautiful in their own right, expressive, and startlingly evocative. Some are downright hilarious for the self-deprecating humor, some biting in their vitriol towards others. Most, however, are just gorgeous expressions from deep out of humanity's past.Do you rememberHow a golden broom grows on the sea beachesYou don't really get much more gorgeous than that.
1147166988	This is the kind of poetry that could turn a lady queer. That is to say, if poetry had that power. Only fragments exist of her poems, and yet the translator has managed to carry across the simple beauty of the essential lyric across quite well. Brava. Both the foreword and afterword allude to the many rumors surrounding the Lesbian poet, although none about her disputed...lady-like tendencies, which reduced the material to yet another cold, straight reading. "But Joey --" you begin, loosening your tie, "was Sappho really a big homo?"And to that I say this: Who cares? This poetry sounds just as beautiful when directed at a person of any gender, romantically or no. As for me, I will be carrying this little book around the next time I court my girlfriend.

Wow. Det tog virkelig de - til tider meget! - korte fragmenter til nye højder. Også Mette Christiansens epilog var spændende, fordi det giver et indblik behind-the-scenes fra filologen.Og så er bogen også bare pisse flot at se på 💜

7618911762	Barnard’s translations of Sappho revolutionized Sappho when they came out, and it’s so easy to see why. For the motion of the Greek and internal awareness of fragmentation, I still prefer Carson, as any reasonable 21st century reader should, but Barnard captures Sappho’s clear, direct tone effortlessly. Her translations are so, so touchable. Anyone who loves Greek lyric should own a copy of Barnard, and now I do—another gift.

3073183306	More than anything else, what I was struck by when I was reading these fragments of poetry, was how alive they seem. I guess because so much of what survives of Sappho's writing has to do with day to day observations (like that one about the ring!) and quite a few universal themes it's hard not to feel like you're somehow close to her as you're reading, as if you could opt to look her up and see when she's going to be doing a public reading close by. There was such warmth and humor in so many of these too; I laughed out loud quite a few times. And as accessible as she is, I also deeply loved how certain she was of her own ability and legacy (I mean, she wrote two death bed poems, for crying out loud).I also need to say how much I loved Barnard's translation and translator's note (and how she snarked on that one academic). She made Sappho's writing crisp and easy to follow (or she brought that out of the work, perhaps). I would definitely recommend this translation, and of course I would recommend Sappho's poetry. The only downside to all this is knowing how much we lost of her work, and how much the world would have been enriched if we still had it.
463415177	When I first flipped through this short book of Ancient Greek poetry, I was struck by a vague feeling of wary doubt that I would enjoy it. All of the poems were so short, and most that I glanced over seemed vague and pointless. However, I decided to read the entire book aloud to myself one day... And found myself swept away by the beautiful, delicate, femininely classical style of Sappho's writing.I found that many of the short, fragmented poems were related to other poems that had come previously or afterward.The best word I can think of to describe this poetry is "gorgeous." The pure beauty of Sappho's words is lovely.Also, I would strongly advise reading the Footnotes (page 95) written by the translator, Mary Barnard. They are greatly helpful, because Sappho often mentions names and unfamiliar places in her poetry. It is helpful to know, for example, that Cleis was the name of her mother, and that most of the other girls she speaks of were her students, whom she taught "religious" dance.Beautiful.
1148018789	You may forget butLet me tell youthis: someone insome future timewill think of usWhat a fantastic introduction to Sappho. In truth, I did not mind the highly fragmented nature of her poems; given the nature of modern poetry, I think we are in a better state of mind that any other time in history to appreciate the slightly disjointed and lyrical simplicity of her words. Marvelous.

3314766287	It is a shame that there are no more Sappho poems in our day. The little that has been preserved is really wonderful. Her free and sensual style is full of sweetness and music. Although they were intended to be accompanied with lyre, reading them is also a pleasure.I loved!

1243420547	Voy a ser sincera.. había poemas que me han costado, o temáticas que no me han llamado tanto, pero es que entre que la edición era bilingüe en griego y castellano OMAIGAT QUE BONITO ES EL GRIEGO y la cantidad de referencias mitológicas que hay.. yo me he enamorado de Safo.Hay que pensar en qué época esta escrito este libro. Como narra sobre la vida, sobre como Safo era tan diferente, sobre la mitología como ejemplo para hacer símiles con las relaciones. Me ha gustado mucho la complejidad de muchos de los poemas, y también, como había cambio de temática conforme iban pasando las páginas. Además, al ser una edición anotada y bilingúe te enteras de mil cosas, conoces también a la autora y te sientes como más cercana a ese período histórico.Cada vez que leo sobre autores de esta época y veo lo de 'sólo nos ha llegado menos del 10% de su obra' es que se me rompe un poco el alma. ¡Oh, tú en cien tronos Afrodita reina,Hija de Zeus, inmortal, dolosa:No me acongojes con pesar y sexoRuégote, Cipria!Antes acude como en otros días,Mi voz oyendo y mi encendido ruego;Por mi dejaste la del padre ZeusAlta morada.El áureo carro que veloces llevanLindos gorriones, sacudiendo el ala,Al negro suelo, desde el éter puroRaudo bajaba.Y tú ¡Oh, dichosa! en tu inmortal semblanteTe sonreías: ¿Para qué me llamas?¿Cuál es tu anhelo? ¿Qué padeces hora?—me preguntabas—¿Arde de nuevo el corazón inquieto?¿A quién pretendes enredar en suaveLazo de amores? ¿Quién tu red evita,Mísera Safo?Que si te huye, tornará a tus brazos,Y más propicio ofreceráte dones,Y cuando esquives el ardiente beso,Querrá besarte.Ven, pues, ¡Oh diosa! y mis anhelos cumple,Liberta el alma de su dura pena;Cual protectora, en la batalla lidiaSiempre a mi lado.Ποικιλόθρον᾽ ὰθάνατ᾽ ᾽Αφρόδιτα,παῖ Δίος, δολόπλοκε, λίσσομαί σεμή μ᾽ ἄσαισι μήτ᾽ ὀνίαισι δάμνα,πότνια, θῦμον.ἀλλά τυίδ᾽ ἔλθ᾽, αἴποτα κἀτέρωτατᾶς ἔμας αὔδως αἴοισα πήλγιἔκλυες πάτρος δὲ δόμον λίποισαχρύσιον ἦλθεςἄρμ᾽ ὐποζεύξαια, κάλοι δέ σ᾽ ἆγονὤκεες στροῦθοι περὶ γᾶς μελαίναςπύκνα δινεῦντες πτέῤ ἀπ᾽ ὠράνω αἴθερος διὰ μέσσω.αῖψα δ᾽ ἐξίκοντο, σὺ δ᾽, ὦ μάκαιραμειδιάσαισ᾽ ἀθανάτῳ προσώπῳ,ἤρἐ ὄττι δηὖτε πέπονθα κὤττιδηὖτε κάλημικὤττι μοι μάλιστα θέλω γένεσθαιμαινόλᾳ θύμῳ, τίνα δηὖτε πείθωμαῖς ἄγην ἐς σὰν φιλότατα τίς τ, ὦΨάπφ᾽, ἀδίκηει;καὶ γάρ αἰ φεύγει, ταχέως διώξει,αἰ δὲ δῶρα μὴ δέκετ ἀλλά δώσει,αἰ δὲ μὴ φίλει ταχέως φιλήσει,κωὐκ ἐθέλοισα.ἔλθε μοι καὶ νῦν, χαλεπᾶν δὲ λῦσονἐκ μερίμναν ὄσσα δέ μοι τέλεσσαιθῦμος ἰμμέρρει τέλεσον, σὐ δ᾽ αὔτασύμμαχος ἔσσο.
6176467307	I found this book a bit disappointing… Prior to reading this book, I read If Not, Winter (a collection of Sappho’s works translated by Anne Carson) which I found to be much more enjoyable and expressive. It translates the words as directly as possible, marking spaces with brackets to show where sections of Sappho’s work were damaged or unrecovered. Conversely, this version is cobbled together from the fragments of her work - something that is rather obvious. The line breaks are different from the original, and the pacing is weird and not as lyrical as the other version. The vivid imagery that made me fall in love with Sappho’s work was almost entirely absent. In short, reading this book directly after Anne Carson’s version was… not great. HOWEVER - this book is still a good read! It contains some gems, and certain arrangements are really lovely! I just found it disappointing compared to the other version. Below is an excerpt from If Not, Winter (Anne Carson translation):I simply want to be dead.Weeping she left mewith many tears and said this:Oh how badly things have turned out for us.Sappho, I swear, against my will I leave you.And I answered her:Rejoice, go andremember me. For you know how we cherished you.And here is the corresponding excerpt from this version (Mary Barnard translation):Frankly I wish I were dead.When she left, she wepta great deal; she said to me, "This parting must be endured, Sappho. I go unwillingly."I said, "Go, and be happy but remember (you knowwell) whom you leave shackled by loveJust one example of the differences. Again, this is not to say Mary Barnards version isn’t good - it absolutely is - I just found it less enjoyable.
4983963336	"I say someone in another time will remember us"You are treasured, not just recognized, Sappho. sappho was the og sad girl, no actually. She is very tender and real in the way she expresses longing and romanticises everyday items in contrast to her love interests.I admire Sappho and I adore Aphrodite; the imaginary dialogues or prayers she has with the goddess are brilliant, risk-taking, and aaah. While remaining true to the original text, this rendition is simply a chefs' kiss and is very sensual.I am especially grateful to my vivvy, Thank you for encouraging me to read anything and everything by Sappho. I annotated half of the book- here are my faves: "When you die you’ll lie dead. No memory of you, no desire will survive, since you’ve no share in the Pierian roses. But once flown away you’ll wander among the obscure dead,invisible even in the house of Hades.""Love shook my senses, like wind crashing on mountain oaks.""You came, I yearned for you, and you cooled my senses that burned with desire.""Girls: Delicate Adonis is dying, Aphrodite – what should we do? Aphrodite: Beat your breasts, daughters, and rend your dresses."

(zzz) men trods af det har de få linjer stor indvirkning og betydning. mine yndlings indkludere:yndlings citat fra fragment 26 “Hvordan kan man andet end tørste efterpinens ophør når dem man elsker gør ènsyg af længsel gang på gang, afroditeHvad er din hensigt” yndlings citat fra fragment 31 “i mine øjne er han som en gud, den mandhvem han end er som sidder over for digog lytter helt henhørt til din søde stemme”“og din henrivende latter. mit hjerteflakser i mit bryst, hver gangjeg får er glimt af dig kan jeg pludseligingenting se ….” fragment 47 “eros fik mit hjertetil at skælve som bjergvinden rammer egetræer” fragment 107 fragment 103 “Eros som løsner lemmer, ryster mig nu igen -sødbitre vilde væsen som kommer snigende” at sammenligne kærligheden med det sødbitre - ligesom honning kan kærlighed være sødt og have en bitter eftersmag eller samtidig bitter påvirkning.
6574073065	This was my first time reading any of Sappho’s work and I think Mary Barnard did splendid work for an artist and poet who had mere fragments remaining of (what we can assume) was an enormous library of work. I give the collection 5 stars for that alone, especially since Barnard made Sappho feel both ancient and modern. Maybe some human experiences truly are universal enough to transcend time and space. But that is why I hear Sappho was so famous to begin with. The poetry itself is reminiscent of modern Instagram or Tumblr poetry, though it outclasses both. I wish we had more than fragments and I wish I could read (and understand) it’s original Greek.
5863059263	really glad to finally own a hard copy of sapphos work. this is a really good collection, and the way the poems are grouped together works really well. a little peeved by the straightening done (changing something gender neutral to boy, etc) but it definitely isn't enough to discredit this translation. besides, sappho's poetry is plenty gay even after being made more heterosexual. it's just unavoidable.
5166791542	I really enjoyed how beautiful language Sappho uses when describing the night or women. Speaking of the night, she clearly had a thing for moonlight, golden things, flowers and women's voices. She describes these so often and so prettily. From her poems I feel like she was very unhappy in maiden hood. I loved reading those beautifully written poems.

It comes to show just how similar we all are, only separated by distance and time. I love Sappho and her honesty. I'm sad only fragments remain. Yet perhaps it is because there are only fragments that I love parceling them out to pain as complete a picture as possible.
2998763575	Great translation. Probably the best place to start for somebody new to Sappho. I can't believe that not only am I NOT new to Sappho, but I own two translations of her poetry. An English major does something to a person, I'm telling you. Get out while you can.

4794655974	Quite the icon. Reread for fun but also so I can better appreciate a friend's analysis of her work.Definitely hits differently than last time I read it, and I am now gnawing at the bars of my enclosure to get more than one of these poems tattooed. ♡
