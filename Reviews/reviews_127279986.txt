3577554041	hi goodreads and welcome to my villain origin story.you may be tempted to say "emma, you are already a villain. your entire persona on this website and in real, actual life is of a sort of gremlin who eats happiness and projects existential dread. all of your opinions are unpopular and the circumstances required for you to like a book increasingly sound like some sort of witchy instructions for an old-timey love spell."to which i would be forced to say, fair. and also forced to follow up: things are about to get even worse.this was my most anticipated book of the last MULTIPLE YEARS...and it's just not even good. the plot is all over the place. the characters don't feel right. there are forced-in additional perspectives that don't track. the dark academia vibe is gone. there's too much magic, too many mythical creatures. it feels like a totally different genre. alex is suddenly a beautiful girl who's constantly being hit on, instead of a skinny scary badass. darlington is, as it turns out, a snooze when not a mystery.everything i liked about this book is gone, replaced by something i actively dislike.i can't force myself to give this lower than 3 stars, because i so actively anticipated it for so many years. and yet.bottom line: this book is straight-up bad.-------------------pre-reviewwell.that didn't go according to plan.review to come / 3 stars tops :(-------------------tbr reviewplease respect my privacy at this time (i need to cry quietly until this book is in my hands)update: TEARS OVER.buddy read with lily eeeeeee
3009022225	This has literally been the week from Hell, which is fitting considering I spent hours typing up a coherent review for a book featuring a heist in Hell, that I thought I had copied and pasted, to in fact not have properly done so.

4641165153	i’m actually lost for words? i was so scared this was going to disappoint me and for a second in the beginning i was kinda thinking it would but just when i needed it to leigh bardugo pulled through. i loved the found family vibes, i loved galaxy stern and i loved darlington naked with horns in his slut era this entire book. leigh bardugo better never make me wait 3 years again but this was definitely more than worth it.
5254203464	nearly a year later and the cover still makes me deeply uncomfortable. i know they say never judge a book by its cover, but sometimes they are just a massive turn off. and this is one of them.thankfully, i dont think my aversion bled over into my feelings about the story. while i didnt enjoy this as much as ‘ninth house,’ primarily because of the drawn out plot and narrative, this still has all the magical charm i associate with LB and the dark world-building that defines this series. i think readers who care about the characters will enjoy this immensely as i feel like they are truly what sell this story.so, overall, a decent sequel and one that further cements LBs place in adult fantasy. ↠ 3.5 stars
5186033511	Just reread itFrom my first read in 2023: 4.5 star. I feel like if I read this a second time I will like it even better. It was SO much detailed information that I found myself getting lost a bit and had to reread things multiple times. But it was great

4176598351	"Galaxy Stern,” Darlington said, his eyes flashing gold, “I have been crying out to you from the start.” Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Spice Meter: 🌶️ (that's all Darlington btw)⚠️Trigger Warning: Blackmail, Nudity, Coarse Language, Mentions of Rape, Mentions of Drug Abuse, Graphic Scenes, Death⚠️❗This review is spoiler-free❗How??? How is this even better than the first one?? I couldn't put it down for even a second. Not that there was even a chance for me to do anything else before I finished it. The beginning was such a tease that it pretty much ensured I wouldn't be able to look away. I'm so glad I bought the ebook as well, instead of waiting for my copy to come a month later. I mean, I finished the whole book and then the hard copy was shipped 🙄🙄 I couldn't possibly imagine waiting that long, I would have gone insane...even more so than what this book did to me. Also, as if the beginning wasn't thrilling enough, that ending has me jumping up and down like a little kid. I am so excited about book 3, I'm going to start manifesting its release date. It's probably not going to work but I can't wait another three years. I can't!! Alex is 10000x better than she was in the first book and she was already incredible in Ninth House. She is an unapologetic badass and she owns me. I love her with all my heart and I want her to use my soul to destroy her enemies. Her attitude towards pretty much anything is pure gold, she has awesome comebacks, and she is willing to kill when it's called for without losing any sleep about it. Normally, that last one would be a major red flag but I have a major soft spot for morally gray characters, especially Leigh Bardugo's morally gray characters. **cough cough* The Darkling and Kaz *cough cough*.As for my favourite boy Darlington, I would gladly kill and die for him, I would let him tear me in half with his giant demon hands and I'd thank him for it. All my suspicions were correct, demon!Darlington is hot as fuck. He has this devil-may-care attitude now, no pun intended but fun anyway, mixed with his natural gallantry that put him right into my list of fictional male hotties. Demon gentleman, indeed. 😏😏 I am so glad I got so much more of him in this book...So. Much. More. 👀👀...I'm definitely talking about his glowstick.Although, when it comes to the relationship between them, these two are taking it so unbelievably, frustratingly slow that I'm just about ready to explode. It's obvious they have feelings for each other, which was never in question, but it's also clear that they aren't ready to act on those feelings. It's understandable, they've been through a lot, but it's also frustrating because I JUST WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY AND TOGETHER!!! I mean, I am sure they are both curious about what the other is like in bed, so why not just give in and find out? It's clearly for educational purposes, and Alex and Darlington love education...👀👀Moreover, I literally love every single secondary character in this series, except for the bad guys, of course. Dawes is a wonderful genius and her loyalty to Alex and Darlington is everything I live for. Turner, the grumpy detective, is just as adorable even though he is still reluctant to form a friendship with Alex. He's getting there, though. Alex can get under everyone's skin, one way or another. 😆😆 There is, however, one secondary character that is my absolute favourite in this series, in fact, he booted Dawes from her spot at number one. Tripp Helmuth is the best, most adorable character in the entire series and no one better hurt him because I will go feral on them. He must be protected at all costs. There is no joy without him.Have you read Ninth House and Hell Bent, yet?

3137259489	At the risk of sounding mean, a thought which frequently occurred to me while reading this was “ah, Leigh Bardugo is just making shit up”. While this might seem obvious given that this is a fantasy novel, what I mean is that I was constantly pulled out of the flow of reading a book by the weird ways in which the way it’s written inadvertently draws attention to itself as a text composed of sentences written to meet a word count for publishers.For the sake of organizing my Many Thoughts I shall chunk this review into sections.1. Demington (nick name is a work in progress) This issue is a light one to start off with but I have to say Darlington in demon form radiates total YA energy. It feels like an image of a character designed with the express purpose of appealing to the tiktok girlies. He is totally naked and more muscular in demon form than in human form and his hair has grown to a sexy shoulder length and he has golden horns and golden eyes and golden tattoos and his “cock [is] very erect and shining like a supercharged, oversized glowstick” (65) (the fact that his erect penis is emitting a heavenly light is mentioned no less than three times in case you thought you misread this). 2. People Don’t Act Like PeopleIn a scene that seemingly comes out of nowhere, Alex decides on a whim to explain not only that magic is real to her normie roommate Mercy Zhao but also to summarize the entire plot of Ninth House including Darlington getting sent to hell and coming back half in and half out of reality as a literal demon who Alex needs to either save or kill before the hellbeast overtakes him and destroys the world or some shit. Mercy’s reaction leaves much to be desired in terms of being a reaction that a normal human being would have to anything at all. She immediately believes everything, says that it all makes sense given Alex’s behaviour the past year of sneaking out of the dorms sometimes and having the occasional depressive episode, and tells Alex not to lie to her again. She also mentions that she’s been using a therapy app because reviewers of Ninth House complained about Mercy’s lack of doing anything post being a vehicle for a rape revenge plot and Bardugo wants us to know she read those complaints and mercy is indeed in therapy. After the exposition ,most of which happens off page and is summarized in a sentence or two, when Alex is walking away, Mercy ends this already unnatural conversation with the most YA novel response one could have to learning that demons are real by asking Alex if Darlington is the reason she hasn’t dated anyone in the 12 months she has known her. Alex waffles about how he’s “too expensive” and also has horns and Mercy jokes about how well she has a birthmark shaped like wisconsin. Very bizarre to end this scene with playful teasing about the potential darlington/alex ship when one of the parties is currently trapped in a demonic circle half in half out of hell and might have to be put down if they can’t separate him from his demon in time.2. 1. People Don’t Act Like People → Mercy is Not a PersonMercy Zhao’s entire character is predicated on being a non character. She is the ultimate NPC. Any reaction she has no matter how inhuman in its sheer lack of reaction can’t be called “out of character” because very little characterization was ever established to begin with. She is Nice, she is booksmart, and she wears quirky clothes. I hesitate to call this meagre collection of traits even two dimensional.In Ninth House, Mercy exists because Leigh Bardugo wanted an excuse to have a scene where a rapist eats shit, so the rapist must first have a victim to rape, and Mercy just happens to be the vehicle through which this revenge plot travels. Someone needs to notify Alex’s mom of her temporary funk so she can be drawn out of said funk and progress the rest of the plot, and Mercy, who has not been in the narrative since the rape plot and will continue to not be in the narrative for the rest of the book, luckily just happens to be there. I suspect Leigh Bardugo heard the negative response some critics had to Mercy’s lack of involvement in the first book, so in Hell Bent when Alex and the gang need a fifth person to complete their HellQuest, Mercy is slotted in there to give her something to do. She doesn’t even join in on HellQuest proper, she just stands guard out of frame while everyone else goes to hell. Her existence is essentially just a pre-established name for Bardugo to use as a placeholder when a side character is required to do a menial task for the plot.This Mercy effect -being completely absent from the book until Leigh Bardugo needs a side character to progress the plot and inexplicably materializing- is at its most literal and by extension most absurd in Chapter 9. Alex meets with Dawes to discuss plot shit which eventually leads to them debating how they are going to find a fifth person for HellQuest, when Mercy interrupts them stating that she will be their fifth person. Apparently she has just been sitting on the couch in the same room as them this entire time and it was never mentioned. She followed Alex in, and neither Alex or Dawes notice this whole ass human being entering and just sitting down within earshot for this entire conversation until they express their need for a side character and Mercy asserts herself as the one for the job. Alex and Dawes warn her of the danger of doing the hell portal opening ritual, but Mercy calmly tosses aside their concerns as if it is inconceivable that anyone but her could be doing the ritual. And Alex and Dawes also quickly just accept it. It’s like they’re all aware they are characters in a novel and it is unfathomable that anyone else would do this task, even someone more qualified (i.e. has known magic even existed for more than like a day) because Mercy is a named character and Leigh Bardugo has to make her a player in the plot because reviewers complained in the last book about Mercy disappearing from the book after her utility as a rape victim was finished.2. 2. People Don’t Act Like People → People Don’t Care About What the Reader Already Knows Not To Care AboutAlso in the vein of people not asking questions normal human beings would, a pivotal part of HellQuest is finding four murderers to walk the gauntlet. Alex, Dawes, and Turner have all already killed someone, so they use a magical slave catching device to locate their fourth murderer, who ends up being side character Tripp Helmuth. (As an aside, Turner is outraged at the repurposed slave catching magical gizmo, but aside from a line in the acknowledgements where Leigh Bardugo links a website about the history of slavery at Yale this never becomes relevant to the book in terms of plot or theme. To me it read as a shoehorned aside for Bardugo to let us know that she is in fact Aware of Slavery and the real historical badness of Yale, but Yale is simply too cool of a setting aesthetically and the legacy of slavery at Yale will never actually be interrogated by the book because it’s not relevant to Alex’s personal journey). Anyway, Tripp is presented as a bumbling idiot who the gang is just relieved to have as a fourth member. Not a single person stops to ask him “by the way Tripp, who did you murder?”. In fact nobody asks each other who they killed upon revelation that they did indeed kill someone, even though I feel like it would be something most people would at least be curious about, even a little. After they’ve already gone to hell once, Mercy asks Alex who she killed, and Alex says some vague lines about it being “too many people” and how she doesn’t feel bad about any of it. Mercy responds to the revelation that Alex is a serial killer the same way she reacts to the revelation that magic is real, which is to say not at all. We as the audience know that the killings were all either in self defence or under the influence of ghost possession, and I guess Mercy is just in tune with the vibes of everything being chill. In a paragraph elaborating Alex’s angst she refers to herself as “the only real sinner in the bunch”, because Dawes killed defending Alex from a violent attacker, Turner is a cop so presumably he just killed some guy on duty who had it coming (kind of a fucked up assumption imo but this review is long enough), and also absolves Tripp of any sin because “muddleheaded Tripp had no doubt bumbled into something he couldn’t handle” (242). This strikes me as kind of an insane claim to make when not only does Alex not know anything about who Tripp killed because nobody asked, but also because it was kind of a major theme of the first book about how rich white boys can use their wealth and status to absolve themselves of any responsibility in harming people less privileged. We soon learn through hell induced memory sharing shenanigans that Tripp is indeed Not a Bad Dude, he just chose not to act when his abuser died as a result of his own actions, but I don’t like how up until the reveal the novel frames the question of “wait, who did this guy murder?” as something we don’t even need to think about, let alone worry about. 3. Gritty Tone??? Near the very end Hell Bent contains a graphic flashback of animal death and it's one of the most gruesome parts of the whole book. It took me a while to work out why I was so disoriented by this one scene of animal gore when there are so many human on human violence scenes in Ninth House which I didn't take offense to but other people did. I am not usually one to gate keep who can and cannot include certain material in their books, but I think the issue here for me stems from whether or not shocking content feels appropriate to the rest of the text. I didn't find the sexual assault scenes in Ninth House beyond the pale because one of the major themes of Ninth House is sexual assault and how people in power cover it up. The whole book in terms of theme and tone was building up to the assaults. Those shocking scenes weren't shock value because Ninth House is a book about abuses of power by the rich and privileged.Hell Bent, however, lacks any thematic clarity that would make this scene tonally appropriate or make sense thematically. There seems to be very little coherency in terms of ideas here at all. It doesn't make sense with the tone because as mentioned this book feels incredibly YA most of the time. Just recall my first point, Demington. I've already mentioned how Bardugo is willing to gesture to acts of historical cruelty but isn't interested in actually following up on the darker real life aspects of the setting she chose vis a vis the repurposed slave catching device. It's very telling to me that Leigh Bardugo is willing to go into graphic detail of the murder of a beloved pet rabbit for shock value but refuses to let literally being physically trapped in hell affect Darlington in any way that would make him even marginally less sexy. It frankly seems kind of cowardly to me that she didn't even let Darlington look even a little fucked up! When it comes to the one of the most marketed characters, gritty realism comes second. Feeding Thirst is the top priority. Leigh Bardugo is an author known for lovable misfit YA ensemble casts who banter, and it especially felt like she was trying to follow the same playbook by forcing the handful of named characters to come together for HellQuest, but she's also trying to write a serious grimdark adult book. It feels like there are scenes in here written to make the book dark and gritty and there are characters written to appeal to fandom and make girls make TikToks about them, and these two things can never meet. Darlington and the ancillary cast are always placed at the edge of legitimately dark content, but aren't allowed to actually touch or be affected by the dark content in any way that would make them less attractive or make their banter less charming. Darlington was sent to hell for a year but he's back and even sexier now. Mercy was raped on camera but she uses a therapy app and is perfectly normal and helpful and chipper all the time. At a certain point the dark content begins to feel like something tacked on to up the age rating, and not something that is actually well integrated into the work.4. HellquestI hate HellQuest so much it’s unreal. I was a defender of the first book from people who called it “boring” but even I have to admit this shit drags. The whole novel is just a series of failed rituals we have to hear about in excruciating detail to get free Darlington from hell and you can really feel the book treading water for the majority of the page length. After failed rituals a big fuss is made about finding murderers to walk the gauntlet to enter hell and it’s a whole big thing with so much page space dedicated to it, and it fails like all the rituals before it. Darlington’s soul isn’t freed until 400 pages in, when he tells Alex that because of her special abilities she can literally just choose to enter hell herself without any rituals, and she does. It feels kind of audacious for Leigh Bardugo to waffle on for 400 pages about every step of this complicated ritual to get into hell and have the characters go through with the ritual and suffer and fail, only for that to be followed up “oh btw you could just step through this portal to hell any time you want because of your specialness” and having the protagonist just skip the several hundred page process by walking through a portal to solve the problem. Anyway after Darlington is freed HellQuest isn’t over because they have to go back AGAIN for plot reasons, but they need all four to go and only Alex can fast travel so we have to watch them walk the gauntlet AGAIN. And then! And then! The cliffhanger at the end! Is that hell is still open! And they have to do HellQuest AGAIN in the third book!!!!!!!!!!! What The Fuck! What The Fuck! I HATE HellQuest! It’s So BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway I didn’t think Hell Bent was very good lol
5210055289	I'm sorry to you and to myself. I just don't get it. What are the girlies talking about??This book took me over 2 weeks to read. I didn't understand why it was taking *this* long to rescue this man. And when we did...'anticlimactic' isn't a good enough word. It isn't a bad book by any means but why does it exist? Nothing happens other than searching for Darlington. There's no plot.Also, let's discuss the concept of Galaxy Stern being an ACTUAL bisexual. Because Pamela Dawes is RIGHT THERE! And she somehow glances over her and every turn. I mean, I totally understand and agree that Darlington is hot. But Dawes is a flaming ace in the hole. She is THE one. What is Alex thinking? Dawes is the Practical Magic dream every lesbian is dreaming of and Alex is sleeping right past the alarms.Anyway, I felt very bored by most of this book. It didn't feel very relevant.I want to stress again that I didn't think it was bad. But very disappointing.
4717016570	I always had a hunch that diving into Leigh Bardugo's work is a safe bet, and so far, my instincts have proven right, in everything I’ve read of hers.I don’t know why I waited so long to read Hell Bent, the sequel to Ninth House. It didn't just meet my expectations; it obliterated them in the most fantastic way possible. Here's why:Worldbuilding“Every inscription and piece of decoration described at Yale, in New Haven, and in Sterling Memorial Library is real…” - Acknowledgements section.Leigh's attention to detail is nothing short of impeccable. She lays bare the dark history of Yale and Sterling Memorial Library, sparing no uncomfortable truths, including the Ivy League's grim ties to slavery.CharactersAlready enamoured with the morally grey FMC Galaxy Stern, the second book allowed me to delve into the lives of other characters in Hell Bent. The gritty introspective exploration of their pasts and presents, coupled with subtle social and political commentary is seamlessly woven into the story without being preachy.Also, I’m here for buildings with charisma and character. It particularly shines for me in dark academia, fantasy, and horror genres, e.g. Hogwarts, The Overlook Hotel (The Shining), and the Scholomance (A Deadly Education). In this series, Il Bastone stands out as another compelling character in its own right and I loved it.StorytellingIt's simply superb. I went through the gamut of emotions – shock, surprise, astonishment, and it was a breathtakingly wild ride.(view spoiler)[Darlington as a demonDarlington in his underworld form is stark naked for a lot of the book and has a giant glowing demon 🐓/ 🍆. That deserves a subheading. (hide spoiler)]I obviously can’t say much more without spoiling the first book, Ninth House, but if you haven’t checked out this series yet and you like Leigh Bardugo, secret societies based on real history, dark magic, ghosts, whodunnits, puzzles, and the paranormal, I highly recommend this. Thanks to Charles for the lively buddy-read discussions!_____Fun literary journey to hell. 🤘
7826060658	“Let’s go to hell”Alex galaxy stern has to now go to hell to steal a soul her Virgil’s soul but no one helps her and the society tries to cover it up by marking darlington as dead and sweeping it under the carpet like lethe always does“So we are hunting for something we can’t even see”“I always admired virtue but I could never imitate it”“She’d been too close to death all her life to shy away from severed limbs and gunshot wounds”Alex stern is determined to steal the soul but hell always demands a price. she needs four murderers to only start the journey but one thing that alex keeps forgetting (aside from that she’s a badass) is that she’s a wheelwalker “Was she a knight? A queen? A demon? Or the devil herself? But at the end did it make any difference she was alexandra galaxy stern”A wheelwalker a person who is a portal themselves who can control the living and the dead ,call them inside and use them who is neither a human nor a demon neither from this world nor from the next but ruler over every domain “It is too easy to believe that we are being watched and studied”“Maybe she hadn’t really understood what salvation would cost her”Call me crazy but i am smitten (pls alex make me your slave) she’s the baddest mf ever. The woman who makes the journey to hell and back not once not twice but three times,fights and conquers countless demons and make the devil lose in his own game is my standard now :) “Isn’t it a merry thing to cheat death”“When faced with death better to dance than to lie down for it”“She didn’t conquer death she slapped it in its face”Talk about Darlington. The gentleman of lethe society who is hungry for knowledge and ultimately death finds himself in the vey pocket of hell where he is a tortured jailer bound to serve a demon prince“I am bound to you stern , to the woman who brought me to hell and the woman who got me out of it, i will serve you till the end of my days”SHE KEEPS HIM LEASHED WITH A FLAME LEASH !!!! (The bare minimum ofc)What else do you want in a dark academiaWith VAMPIRES!!!!“I’ve been crying out to you from the start”“A little magic, a talent of taking a beating and a demon at her side was all she had but maybe it was all she ever needed”And tbh I don’t know how to explain the yearning and pining but maybe this quote will help“Maybe they were just two killers, cursed to endure each other’s company, two doomed spirits trying to find their way home. Maybe they were just monsters who liked the feeling of another monster looking back at them. But enough people had abandoned them and they weren’t going to abandon eachother”“I’m just not made right I don’t know if it’s remorse or conscience but I’ve never regretted killing men”“She feels more guilt and remorse over a rabbit she couldn’t save than the heap of men she murdered”

I found Alex even more interesting this time around than I did the first (I actually liked this better than I did TNH) and I had the chance to fall in love with LB's writing all over again as pages and plot progressed. HOWEVER, I admit I expected this to go into a different direction and was a little disappointed to see it didn't. Not fully, anyway. I found some parts to be unnecessary (or unnecessarily long) to the plot and the characters' development; in LB's defense, this sequel really felt more like a part 2 than a different story with the same characters, so I guess I should have thought of it as a continuation rather than a new adventure. I also didn't like how you literally can't catch a breath with this story. I know I said I LOVE that this is fast-paced and packed to the brim with paranormal shenanigans, but I would have appreciated more time to decompress and between an action scene and the other and maybe spend some time in the mind of someone who wasn't Alex.I'm also very very very very sad that (view spoiler)[there was so little Darlington and SO LITTLE OF HIM AND ALEX (hide spoiler)]. I mean...(view spoiler)[yes, we got to see Darlington's glowing mosnter cock, but maybe a middle-ground wouldn't have hurt. (hide spoiler)]Oh, well, we all know this is how LB rolls, and some things aren't necessary for a book to be good, but...(view spoiler)[I DESERVED MY STARLINGTON KISS! (hide spoiler)] and book 3 better provide.Overall this was a worthy sequel and a peculiar new adventure that gives off Kingsman meets Lockwood & Co. vibes, but make it heisty and emotionally twisty.Also, isn't just me or does Darlington actually resembles The Raven Cycle's Gansey? A grown-up, less starry-eyed version of Gansey, but their curiosity and their love for anything mythologial and magical felt the same.

5180544677	5 stars - I went back and forth heavily in this rating, and it’s only because of the last 8 pages of the book. In theory, the set up for the next possible book is interesting, but the pace of it was off and felt a bit cheesy. Obviously not cheesy enough for me to give it anything under 5 stars, though. Loved it. I was so invested in the story and honestly liked it so much more than the first book, and I already loved ninth house.
4879250303	A meaning to an end, this was my primary feeling all book long.We have the Ninth House, with its Dark Academia vibe, the introduction to a new world, a possible ship, and enough plot twists that I didn't actually sleep when I read it.And then we have Hell Bent, which was expected as you can expect a child to be born. But…The Dark Academia vibe is completely gone and now we live in Supernatural with vampires, demons and the door of Hell opened (it's actually season 5).All the story is about getting Darlington out of Hell but, when we finally have him here, he's not Darlington anymore. Where’s his charm? His intellect? His sharp sense of humour?And this leads us to the forced ship between him and Alex. They're so hot from each other’s pov, were they always so hot?, I’d pretty much like to have sex with her, he always was pretty but now he looks like a fallen prince. Why would you do this to me, Leigh? Why can't we have our build-up chemistry in peace? And even if I’m happy with the addition of Turner, Tripp, Mercy and more Dawes; even if I read pages and pages of descriptions; even if most of the time the only topic was not knowing what was going on… the feeling stays the same.Leigh Bardugo created something with Ninth House, but it was one book without a precise idea of what would have happened next. How can you keep a Dark Academia vibe if one of your characters is stuck in Hell?Hell Bent is a change of scenario in the function of the next chapter. Yale doesn't matter anymore, Alex's past is just her past now, she and Darlington are connected and there are still plenty of questions about what she is and what can she do. It’s not my favourite genre - whatever this is called -, but it's still Leigh Bardugo.Meaning: I’d read her shopping list, but I still reserve myself the right to be disappointed.↠ 3.5 stars
5897342239	Holy hell is this book good. So good. So devilish. So witchy. So vampy. So beautiful. So dark. So introspective. I am now hell bent on making everyone I know read this series. How long until book three? I can’t wait any longer and I just finished this yesterday.”You can’t walk through hell unchanged.” Literally and figuratively, and applicable to all the characters here in both ways. Sequels can be tricky, especially in the fantasy realm. Unless you’re Leigh Bardugo. Then they are so easy you forget this is a series at all and ask yourself if this is just a continuation of book one. If that makes sense. It’s a huge compliment to her writing and the plot. Anyways. This sequel is just as good as Ninth House and had me on the edge of my couch the entire damn time. Obsessed with these characters, this world of secret academic occult societies, and a world where the events of this series can actually be happening around me without me knowing. Hell Bent continues from the semi-cliffhanger at the end up book one and follows Alex and Dawes’ journey to literally hell to rescue Darlington. You get all the intricate, creative, ritualistic spells and research and activities and enchanted objects and history. But you also get more information about the various characters’ backstories and crimes and inner struggles. We get more insight into Alex and her past and Ground Zero and Hellie (who for the record I didn’t really like in Ninth House and was happy to see Alex start to see Hellies flaws in this one.). We even get more Tripp Helmuth, who ends up being a loveable dope but with a twist ending. ”What would hell look like for her? She knew damn well. She’d wake up back at her old apartment, back with Len, as if none of this had ever happened, as if it had all been some wild dream. There would be no Yale, no Lethe, no Darlington, no Dawes. No secret stories, no libraries full of books, no poetry. Alex would be alone all over again, staring into the deep black crater of her future.”In this same vein, this book also plays with the dual definition of hell: real hell and metaphorical hell. I love this concept from a literary perspective. Hell is the physical place with brimstone and fire and demons and death. Hell is also the darkest part of your life that you’d do anything to forget, a time or place or person or course of events that you escaped from and never want to face again. We all have personal hells. Even Darlington and Turner, seemingly upstanding men of knowledge and law. But especially Alex, who is forced to relive both types of hell over and over again. ”She was more beautiful than he remembered. No, that wasn’t true. It wasn’t that she had changed or that his vision had sharpened. He was just less afraid of her beauty now.” And of course we get more Darlington. Now I know this is not a romance but I love him. And I love him and Alex. Keeping this spoiler free so I won’t put the quote in, but when he is explaining to Alex about his shackles and who he serves he says THE QUOTE that made me put the book down and pace my room for a minute. Chills. I cannot wait to explore their dynamic and relationship more in book three. 👹🌌✨🐍🖤I’ll likely forever be processing this series. 5 huge stars.Also justice for Babbit Rabbit. And someone go rescue poor Loki. Justice for him, too.

4643311623	I’m just going to come out and say it, Hell Bent is a mess! Somehow Bardugo fell victim to every sequel pitfall imaginable. The plot was chaotic, poorly paced, and also somehow boring? All real connection to the dark academia/secret societies that hooked me in Ninth House is regurgitated like hastily completed homework via dense info dumps, rather than woven organically into the repetitive, demon hunting saga. Seriously, who knew that trips to the underworld could be so banal?Tonally the book felt like a mix of Buffy’s worst story arcs with a dash of Netflix’s weirdly horny but ultimately unsexy take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Seriously, one reference to a glowing demon erection is too many, but multiple reminders about it followed by being forced to read Darlington himself describe his schlong as “glowing like a New England lighthouse” is pure torture. Then, to add insult to injury, Darlington and Alex have very few scenes together, and there is no real effort to foster any sexual tension so these weird asides just feel comically out of place. Like Taylor Swift dropping f-bombs. Potentially even worse than the glowing penis, but too weird not to share is this gem: “He had been tempted to bury his face in his soup bowl and lap it like a greedy animal. He wanted to place himself between Alex’s legs and do the same to her.” Pardon me while I pour bleach in my eyes. Forget Ivy League hidden Gauntlets, reading Bardugo’s lack lustre smut adjacent quips are my own personal portal to hell.
3012411421	no cover? no title? no release date?cool cool I'll sell my soul for this book
3465003946	Disappointed. What’s with the naked D?! 😭 so not what I have been waiting for. It’s a me problem. ByeAlso, I hate the cover. Also, I want to know how come this sequel didn’t end up as the most favourite of the year when many said it’s their absolute favourite when they received it?! Let my Darlington drown in another alternate world but not in the world of this sequel....Are you there, Darlington? (Actually got happier when my autocorrect knows you 🤘🏻)ZZZ(For the sake of Darlington, Bardugo, do something.Like announcing the publication year and month so that I can start collecting enough caffeine to last 🤦*2023 be blessed 🥹)
5740923257	I’m on BookTube now! You can find my channel here! =)”Too many shadows, too much history, too many bodies piling up. Too many enemies. There was no way to fight them all.” If this isn’t the short summary of “Hell Bent” then I dunno. This book was quite the journey and I enjoyed it immensely. Probably even more than the first book and I think that’s mostly due to the fact that all the main players were already introduced. We were finally allowed to dig deeper and to find out more about the characters and their background stories and since I’m a person that loves character driven books this was totally my cup of tea. Also it was less gruesome and disgusting than the first book. I know you’d think that a book that’s called “Hell Bent” would be even harder to digest than “Ninth House” but despite the entire hell aspect this was actually pretty easy to read and definitely had less horrible scenes than in the first book. At least that’s the kind of impression the book left me with. Whilst the first book had a heavy focus on getting to know Alex’s world, her past and who she is, the focus of the second book was clearly on Darlington and how to get him back from hell. I don’t know how to express this but for me it felt like Leigh Bardugo went back to her roots with this one and just told her story without adding too many dark scenes for shock value which worked perfectly fine for me.Sometimes you don’t have to scandalize your readers to tell a great story and just have to give more room to the characters and their development which is exactly what Leigh did with this book. I loved to get to know Turner and Tripp and I was very happy Mercy got a bigger part in the story as well. As for the new addition of Professor Walsh-Whiteley… Boy, I could have done without that misogynistic excuse for a man. No fan of him and never will be. Still, all the characters fighting not only against literal demons but also against their own inner demons was what made this book so good and before I continue to write an essay I’ll just go to my characters section and discuss all the MCs there. The characters: You are descending down to hell. Be careful, it’s full of dangerous demons, things that will cause you to question your sanity, nightmares that will haunt you for the rest of your life and … It’s full of spoilers!! Probably the worst thing you’ll encounter down there. So beware! ;-P Alex Stern:”Why didn’t these people ever get it? Protect your own. Pay your debts. There was no other way to live, not if you wanted to live right.” I swear Alex still has some of the best one-liners ever. I really love her character and that she’s so driven. Darlington and Dawes are her family and there is nothing she wouldn’t do for them. Honestly, the lengths she went to in order to get Darlington back from hell. Wow, that’s some serious determination and I adore that about her. Alex might be a morally grey character but she knows what’s right and what’s wrong and even though she toes the lines sometimes her inner compass always steers her back to the right path. She would never leave any of her friends behind and she has some sort of integrity that’s not easy to find. She’s extremely loyal to those she loves and cares about and I think she doesn’t even know half about what she’s capable of. Considering everything Alex has been through in her short life it’s amazing she’s still braving it all, going out there and doing her thing. This woman is a survivor and people better don’t underestimate her. I’m very curious about book three because I’m sure we’ll get to know more about what it means to be a wheel and now that Darlington is back, the two storylines can merge into one which brings so much potential to the table! ARGH! I can’t wait to read it all! ”I don’t know how to forgive,” Alex admitted. “And I don’t think I want to learn.”"Life is cruel. Magic is real. And I'm not ready to die." ”She had to find a way back to the game of pretend she’d played last year, had to find a new sea level. They would bring Darlington back. They would make everything right again.””A little magic. A talent for taking a beating. A demon at her side. That was all she had, but maybe it was all she needed.“Come on, Darlington,” she said. “Let’s give them hell.”Darlington:”The chalk circle glowed golden, less a circle than a shimmering wall, and at its center, Daniel Tabor Arlington V sat cross-legged, naked as a baby in the bath. Two horns curled back from his forehead, their ridges gleaming as if shot through with molten gold, and his body was covered in bright markings. A wide golden collar ringed his neck, ornamented with rows of garnet and jade.”Oh my gosh!!! I have so many thoughts about Darlington I can barely put them into coherent sentences! I mean, what a way to enter the book?!! Buck naked with a glowing… you know. *LOL* No, but seriously, there is so much to unpack here. From his childhood and how he became the golden boy of Lethe, right to how he ended up in hell and what he did there. My poor tortured Darlington. I felt so sorry for him and suffered with him. To be in hell for so long. It must have changed him profoundly. Alone the line: ”He would pretend to be human again until he was.”!It says so much about what he experienced, how he feels about the things he had to do in order to survive. There’s darkness in him now, don’t get me wrong, it was always there, but it’s stronger now and it will be hard for him to keep it at bay. There’s some rough side to the carefully crafted smooth gentleman we always got to see on the outside and I personally lived and breathed for it. To get a glimpse at his thoughts, his inner turmoil, it was so well done. I’m sure Darlington’s time in hell will be a big factor and topic in the next book and I think I’ll never be able to face that. My poor, poor, broken boy. T_T Darlington deserved so much better than that. I hope he can heal and will come back stronger than before. Eventually his façade will crack and I genuinely hope that Alex and the others will be there to catch him when he falls. >_< He has the potential to be a very complex character and I’m so ready to see it happening. ”Find the Gauntlet, make the descent. Come get me, Stern.” He paused then, and his golden eyes flashed open. “Please.” That word, raw and human, was all she could bear.”He's ... expensive." Darlington was too beautiful, too well-read, too well-traveled. He wasn't just cut from a different cloth; he was too finely made and tailored.”At the time, Alex had wondered how bad it could have been, growing up in a mansion. But now that she’d been in Darlington’s grandfather’s head, seen his memories of a little boy lost in the dark, she understood why that boy would come here, to a place full of people and noise, where there was always something to read or to look at, where no one would think twice about a studious kid with a backpack who didn’t want to leave.””Darlington sat down on the edge of the bed, the knowledge of everything that had happened crashing into him. If he let his mind alight on any single thought for too long, he’d go mad. Or maybe he was already mad. How was he supposed to be human again after what he’d seen and done?””Demons were not thinking creatures. They operated on instinct, driven by their appetites. He had prided himself on being nothing like that. Never rash. Guided by reason. But now he wanted in a way he never had. He had been tempted to bury his face in his soup bowl and lap at it like a greedy animal. He wanted to place himself between Alex’s legs now and do the same to her.”Turner:"I think I do. But I definitely believe in the devil, and if he gets hold of a soul and doesn't want to let it go, I think you have to try to pry it away from him. Especially if that soul has the makings of a soldier."Ahh Turner is really growing on me as a character. I already liked him in the first book but we got to know him so much better in “Hell Bent” and it was nice to be in his head every once in a while. I think in some way he might be the conscience of the group because he has his values and as a policeman he holds to them. It’s interesting that he’s also religious and seems to take the fight between good and evil very seriously. It’s something he believes in and it’s his main motivation to help Alex and the group. He might not agree with everything they do, but he still helps them because he knows it’s the right thing to do. Turner still seems to see the world in black and white, but I’m sure that will change over time. No one can be as exposed to the supernatural world as Turner and not be changed by it. Mark my words, we’ll see it on page. I’m sure of it. ;-)”This is what your magic is for, isn’t it? This is what it does. Props up the people in power, lets the people with everything take a little more?” "He loved his family, loved his people. He could be their sword and their protector. He needed to believe he could." Mercy:”I was a really lonely kid. The advantage to being unpopular is you get a lot more reading done.”Alex shook her head. “Boy, did you come to the right place.”*sighs deeply* Mercy. Poor Mercy. She had no idea what she was getting herself into. I was very proud of her taking things into her own hands and doing what she wanted to do. She was such a great addition to the group, brought a lot of knowledge with her, and turned out to be extremely useful. Her being a part of Alex’s group made perfect sense to me. I was glad she came out stronger after everything that happened to her, but I’m kinda worried the ending of “Hell Bent” might have thrown her off course. It’s all good fun until push comes to shove and you have to make a decision and get your hands dirty. I think Mercy underestimated that and now she has to live with the consequences. It’s not Alex’s fault because she tried to warn her so I really hope those two will be able to mend what’s broken in the next book. >_<”But we’re always in danger. Go to a party, meet up with the wrong person, walk down the wrong street. I think … I think sometimes it’s easier if instead of waiting for trouble, you go to meet it.” The relationships & ships:Alex & Darlington:”Galaxy Stern,” Darlington said, his eyes flashing gold, “I have been crying out to you from the start.”THOSE TWO!!! I swear the air between them was so charged you could have easily set the room on fire by just breathing and I absolutely dig it? Like, I’m so glad there is so much chemistry between them and that it’s building up. Slowly, steadily, a full on proper slow burn about to unfold. I know everybody and their grandma wants them to have sex, I’ve seen plenty of reviews stating that very sentence, but I think it’s good the way it’s done here. Why does it always have to be physical? Isn’t the sizzling chemistry that’s between them and building up way more beautiful and interesting than them just spending a night together? Those are two characters that have literally gone through hell and back and they deserve room to grow, to get to know each other, to cope with their trauma first before they go for a relationship. Yeah, I know it could just be sex, but we all know that Darlington and Alex are more than that. There’s a deeper connection between them and they are just getting to know each other so I’m totally on board of exploring their chemistry and their slow-burn a little bit more. Might be the demisexual in me but it is the way it is. *shrugs* I’m probably the only voice that doesn’t demand sex but that’s okay for me. *lol* Anyway! Back to those two! I kinda like that Darlington seems to be more straight forward with that he thinks and the fact it sort of throws Alex is a lot of fun to watch. I mean that sentence about “predilection for first editions and women who like to lecture him”? Haha! Gosh, I lived for that. I honestly hope for more moments like that and a ton of chemistry that’s oozing off the pages! To have a relationship won’t be easy with all the baggage those two bring into the game, but I’m sure Leigh Bardugo will be able to make it. I mean alone the power dynamic is quite heavy, with Alex basically being Darlington’s master now. Boy, this isn’t going to be easy, yet I’m still ready for book three! Bring it on! XD”Danny, come home.”Darlington’s shoulders slumped. His head bowed. The rock slid from his hands. When he looked up, his eyes met hers, and in them she saw the anguish of ten thousand hours, of a year lost to suffering. She saw guilt in them too, and shame, and she understood: That golden demon was Darlington too. He was both prisoner and guard here in hell, tortured and torturer.”Darlington?” Alex stammered. “I … Where are you going?”“To get some clothes, Stern,” he said, climbing the steps and leaving bloody footprints behind. “A man can spend only so much time without trousers on before he begins to feel like a deviant.”Alex stared up at him, one hand on the banister. The gentleman of Lethe had returned.”They watched each other in the quiet of the kitchen. They knew everything about each other. They knew nothing at all. He had a sense that they had entered into an uneasy truce, but he couldn’t quite name the war. She was more beautiful than he remembered. No, that wasn’t true. It wasn’t that she had changed or that his vision had sharpened. He was just less afraid of her beauty now.””You know your problem?”“A predilection for first editions and women who like to lecture me about myself?”“An unhealthy respect for the rules. Get some sleep.” She vanished down the dark hall, there and gone, like some kind of magic trick.”These marks mean I am bound in service. Forever.”“To hell? To Golgarot?”He laughed then, the sound deep and cold, the thing at the bottom of the lake. “I’m bound to you, Stern. To the woman who brought me out of hell. I will serve you ‘til the end of days.”Alex & Turner:"Before the doors could close, Turner shoved his hand in and they pinged back open. "I've got it," he said. "You always looked like you had trouble chasing you."Alex jabbed the door-close button. "So?""Now you look like it caught up."I really like their dynamic. There’s animosity but also a lot of respect and it’s such a pleasure to see that played out on page. I think after they both have been in the heads of each other they have a very good understanding of how the other person thinks and feels. And of what moves and drives them. I’m pretty sure in another life they might have been friends right from the start, but in this one they caught each other on the wrong foot and slowly learn to trust each other. Their relationship is one they had to fight for, but I think that makes it even more precious. At the moment there’s some sort of tentative trust between them, but I’m sure it will get a chance to bloom. Come to think of it their relationship dynamic reminds me a little bit of a father and his reluctant kid. I think in some way Turner actually is filling in as some sort of father figure for Alex, because whenever she was in real trouble she called him. I wonder if she’s going to realize that in the next book. Guess we’ll find out. I’m very curious about how their relationship is going to develop. ”Besides, if Turner believed something was off, there was. She’d been in his head, looked through his eyes. She’d seen the world as he did, the details of it, the signs and signals everyone else missed or ignored. She’d felt the prickle at the base of her skull.””You can’t walk through hell unchanged.”“We’ll see,” he said, heading down the steps. He paused on the walkway and looked back at her. “It changed you too, Stern. You may not care about good and evil, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. You stole a man out of hell. You beat a demon at his own game. You’d better think about what that means.”“And what’s that?”“The devil knows your name now, Galaxy Stern.”Conclusion:“Hell Bent” was great and I really enjoyed that we finally got to see more of the characters, their background stories and their motives. Whilst the first book focused on Alex and her life, the second instalment managed to involve many of the former side-characters and shed some light on Darlington’s thoughts as well. Book two definitely wasn’t as gruesome and gross as the first book and I was very thankful for that. Still, there was enough action to glue me to the pages and I was through the book in no time. ;-) With the storyline from “Ninth House” and the addition of Darlington’s return I can’t help but be curious about book three, though. Let’s hope we won’t have to wait all too long. _______________________________I never thought I’d say this, but I finally finished my first book in August! Yay!Okay, it might be the first and last book I finish in August but that’s fine by me.Also wow, the wait for book 3 is going to be pure torture. I really liked this one, though. Is it just me or was this actually tamer than the first one?! Full RTC soon! =) Or at least as soon as I can manage to get to it. ________________________________I’ve to return this to the library in three weeks!481 pages, I can do this! ;-PNo, honestly, I’ll page through "Hell Bent" if I can, because I’ve been dying to read this book ever since I finished the first one and Leigh Bardugo never disappoints. Also fingers crossed we’ll get more of Darlington in book 2. I need more of the Golden Boy of Lethe. Kinda worried about him, though. >_< Anyway! Let’s go! Find me on:My BlogInstagram
3803986369	❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀ tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ That was what Lethe and the societies demanded. Secrecy. Loyalty. Well, fuck them.In Hell Bent, the long-awaited sequel to the high-octane Ninth House, we are reunited with the danger-prone and dangerous Alex Stern. Still recovering from her several near-death experiences, and attempting to keep up with her coursework and maintain the facade of being a regular(ish) student, Alex is determined to rescue Darlington from hell. Of course, opening a door to the underworld is no easy feat and it very much goes against protocol. After a botched attempt risks exposing their plans to the Board, Alex and Dawes enlist the help of some willing and not-so-willing allies. Whereas Ninth House is propelled by a murder mystery, by Alex’s own mysterious past and unreliability, and by Darlington’s disappearance, the storyline in Hell Bent feels more like a quest of sorts, as Alex and Dawes have to sift through ancient texts and old journal entries to try to locate an artefact that may help them in their attempts to reach hell. Alex also has to deal with some unfinished business from her past, as she once finds herself tangled in some shady business and comes across a new foe that may just be out of her league. Additionally, the deaths of two faculty members also force Alex to question how and if it is connected to their quest to rescue Darlington. Whereas the societies played a large role in Ninth House, here the focus remains on Alex and Dawes’ efforts to reach and rescue Darlington. They are soon forced to the realization that the Darlington they will find is no longer the gentleman that they knew. Alex is as always a messy and compelling character who often careens about danger. She is also tenacious, a survivor, and she will stop and do nothing to get Darlington back, not only because of guilt but because she genuinely misses him. Throughout the course of the novel, which, unlike Ninth House, takes place over a relatively short amount of time, we see her trying her hardest to do better, for others, and for herself. It was lovely to see her partnership with Dawes solidify into an unlikely friendship, and I also found myself liking her quarrelsome dynamic with Turner not exactly smooth out but becoming something resembling acceptance, respect even. While Leigh Bardugo continues her critique of academia and patriarchal power structures, in Hell Bent we are mostly confronted with actual demons, who seem to be very much embodiments of vice. Sure, we are reminded of how unjust the power wielded by the secret societies, and of how their access to magic was often used to maintain the status quo and wielded against marginalized communities. Lethe’s latest protector did feel a bit heavy-handed, in how openly misogynistic and regressive he was. What we learn about him also struck me as slightly clichéd and given the lack of confirmed lgbtq+ characters a bit of a letdown. Still, I appreciated Bardugo’s commentary, on wealth, on the power of knowledge, and on privilege, as well as her nuanced yet unflinching portrayal of trauma. Alex’s voice is utterly compelling. She is by no means an easy character to like or root for but, like and root for her I did. Yes, she’s full of grit and seems unrelentingly resourceful, but we once again see her more vulnerable side. From her confused feelings and yearning for Darlington, to the affection she feels for Dawes and Mercy. Her grief, over Hellie, over the kind of life she could have had if she had never seen the Grays, haunt her even as she tries to forge a future that resembles normalcy. I do wish that Alex stopped blaming herself for everything, as she is often doing her fucking best for the people she cares about.The setting was edgy and atmospheric, once again combining urban fantasy, Gothic, and academia aesthetics. Magic in these pages is often ugly, which is something refreshing and honestly subversive. So I was a bit disappointed by certain aspects of Alex’s quest. They seemed a bit vanilla, and, while the narrative does seem self-aware of this, it still gave me HP vibes (let’s just say it has to do with the gangs' ‘powers’). Overall this was a gripping read. The storyline maintains a good balance between character and plot development. There are moments of levity and humor that counterpoint scenes that are darker, and more intense. Bardugo's banter is entertaining, witty, and really solidifies the developing and shifting dynamics between Alex and other characters. The world-building is as enticing as it was in Ninth House and Darlington's faith, which hangs in the balance, will undoubtedly keep readers turning pages. The chemistry between Darlington and Alex is at an all-time high and scenes exploring their attraction and kinship were gold. While the first half is more of a slow burn after the halfway mark things really take off and shit hits the fan as Alex is against several adversaries.Despite not being driven by mystery as Ninth House was, Hell Bent is certainly a suspenseful read as Alex and Dawes' mission to save Darlington is constantly under threat. First of all, they have to carry it out in secret, they have to figure out how they will get to him, and eventually, they also have to confront their darkest moments.After that ending, and having grown very fond of Alex and the rest of her crew, I can't wait to read the next book in this series.

4641110248	DARLINGTONNNNNNThis cover is deliciously creepy
3024832399	4.25/5 ⭐Oh.Is this the sequel we have been waiting for in which our beautiful and smart and precious baby Darlington is safe and sound and totally in the actual book?? ❤Update: yep 👀
5474682314	This book was so good! I was captivated by this book from the very beginning. The plot was so interesting and the pacing was perfect. The plot went in a very different direction from the first book, which I really enjoyed. There were several plot twists that I didn't expect. The world building was so good, I enjoyed learning about the world full of magic, secrets, and demons. The characters were so interesting and had so many layers, I enjoyed learning more about the characters pasts. I love Alex, she is brave, strong, stubborn, resilient and will do whatever it takes to protect the people she loves. Alex's character development was great, I enjoyed watching her accept her mistakes and realize that she has great friends that care about her. I really like Darlington, he is charming, smart, mysterious, strong. I love Dawes, she is kind, sweet, helpful, and smart. I loved Alex and Dawes even more in this book than the first book. I love Tripp, he is fun, sweet, kind and outgoing. I was a bit disappointed with a decision the characters made that involves Tripp. I also like Mercy a lot she is kind, outgoing, smart and brave. The character development was excellent, I enjoyed learning more about the characters and understanding their past. I loved the banter between Alex and Darlington. I like Alex and Darlington's relationship, but I wanted more and I was disappointed about a situation involving them. I really enjoyed the mystery in this book, it was interesting and I enjoyed trying to solve the mystery myself. The ending was so exciting and shocking! I can't wait to read the next book!
5255430806	2.5 rounded up.I'm very disappointed with this.I did not love Ninth House, but I thought it showed promise and the way it ended left me wanting to know what would happen next. Unfortunately, this sequel doubled-down on the elements of Ninth House that, in my opinion, were the weakest. Characterization is almost entirely absent in this book. Even the main character, Alex, from whose perspective we see most of the story, is lacking. The supporting cast feel like plot devices more than characters.Then, there's the magic system. From the outset, the type of magic we're dealing with in these books is a hard sell for me, but I can go with it if I find the story and characters compelling enough. The author of Six of Crows I thought would deliver on those things, but alas, it was not so. This magic "system" is a chaotic, hodgepodge grab-bag of ideas, rules, and elements that result in our characters spending almost the whole runtime of this book engaged in fetch-quests and overly complicated rituals that come with nonsensical info dumps about the supposed reasons for things working the way they do or for why they are necessary for our characters to perform. There are a lot of dark and troubling things that the characters are confronted with, experience, or have to overcome, but the book is more interested in the logistics of that, the macabre imagery of that, than the internal emotional effects of those things. I would much rather have read a simpler story, with less quests, less puzzles, less magical nonsense, and more time spent with the characters, seeing them actually deal with the situation they've been put in, marinating in the myriad emotions they would be going through. But, because this doesn't happen, I do not feel like the events of this book have weight or stakes and I can't take any of it seriously.I'll probably read the next one, just to see where this goes, but I'm not eagerly anticipating the next installment and I probably won't ever reread these books, which is a shame. There is a rich premise here that, in my opinion, is being squandered.
4643213660	Since I’m trying to keep this spoiler free, it will be a shorter review than normal. I might upload a longer version later.One thing that took longer than this book to get to the damn point was how long Leigh took to publish this which is 1,180 days to be exact. This was my most anticipated read of 2023 and it saddens me to give it a 3-star rating. It deserves a 3.75-star rating at best but it does not deserve to be rounded up to four stars. It’s also a shame that I probably won’t wait around for the next book. The thing is, I’ll forget all about this by the time the next book is announced let alone published and I’m sorry but I don’t like this series enough to reread the first two books to refresh my memory for the third one. We will see what happens since I’m indeed a sucker for Darlington and his glow stick. We suffered through an extremely complicated magic system and confusing houses and a shitton of other only for them to be forgotten on this one. The dark academia vibes were gone with the houses too. I do enjoy urban fantasy but come on…What are we supposed to do with all the information we have now?The whole personality and importance of the Grays were gone too. They were merely weapons to be used and not actually souls which sucked after the first book. There were a few notable ones but the rest was as important as a heater in the summer months. Alex was using and discarding them shortly after, it was like watching a fuck boy go through a sorority house. I’ll say this though, the pacing was way better than the first book, especially towards the end even though the characters didn’t feel as deep due to that. We didn’t get to see them work through their emotions and what they were going through because everything was happening all at once. Even though the characters lost their depth, they were still a joy to be around. I still did enjoy living the world through Alex’s eyes. Darlington deserved way more parts than he got in this book. Dawes was a cutie and Turner was shockingly sufferable. I also very much enjoyed Tripp's presence and his addition to the group would be amazing to see. So in the end I can fuck around and come back to the series just for the characters. Especially Darlington. The hold that boy has on me is INSANE. Also, I feel like the next book will have a blue cover and I honestly have no idea why. Just putting it out there for future reference.
5526155168	Galaxy "Alex" Stern is back and this time around she's preparing to walk the 'Gauntlet', the magical path created by a bunch of misfits in order to descend to the underworld or hell (an inexcitable version too but interesting nevertheless;"Alex squinted out at the flat gray day. Could it even be day if there was no sun visible? The bruised sky stretched on and on, and wherever they were…No pits of fire. No obsidian walls. It felt like a suburb, a new one, for a city that didn’t exist. The streets were spotless, the buildings nearly identical. They had the shape of the strip malls that lived on every corner of the valley, full of nail salons and dry cleaners and head shops. But there were no signs over the doors here and no customers. The storefronts were empty.") as it's so often put, so that she can rescue the beloved golden gentleman of Lethe.It's a solid offering continuing in the vein of the first and explores a bit more into the universe created by Bardugu. It's also well written and enjoyable, which at this point is starting to feel like a given with this author.We see a bit more of the characters introduced in the prior book and some more of their motivations and desires too. Worth a read for fans of this genre; a bit of a mystery, a bit of literary fiction, some bit of fantasy and supernatural with some dark academia thrown in the mix. Recommended.2023 Read
4881550015	I enjoyed this second book even more than the first one. I read it in an hour, and as soon as I finished, I felt inspired to write a love song about it. Then I saw Taylor Swift and Beyoncé competing to sing the song I had written for the book in my living room.Meanwhile, I received a call from my husband, who informed me about a construction issue in our new 30,000-square-foot Dubbed the Stone Mansion Bel Air. And then, you guessed it, I woke up! In reality, it all makes sense because, truth be told, I didn't enjoy the first book, and the second book of the series wasn't to my liking either. The rest of the events in my dream are certainly more believable!Ninth House invites readers into a mysterious realm of secret societies, spinning a tale of dark academia through the lens of dual perspectives and timelines. Conversely, Hell Bent opts for a more direct paranormal narrative, plunging into the abyss with puzzles, magical relics, and demonic forcesDespite Bardugo's profusion of ideas, both books share a critical flaw: a penchant for grandiose plot gestures at the expense of character intricacies and narrative subtleties. This oversight leaves readers longing for the untapped thematic and emotional richness within the story.Let's not beat around the bush- the dark academia and secret society allure from Ninth House are revisited awkwardly through dense info dumps, failing to seamlessly meld into the repetitive demon-hunting saga. That’s why I didn’t enjoy this book!Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter
4641367583	this book was WAY better than ninth house. love love love darlingstern. the slow burn between them is too good and well thought out. can’t believe im going to be in an assisted living facility when book 3 drops.
5211166549	f*ck the grishaverse, I need leigh bardugo to focus on alex stern and alex stern only. this series is pure magic.This book was everything that I was hoping for and more. Leigh Bardugo has a hold on the dark academia aesthetic that I personally have not experienced before. She has near seamlessly incorporated fantastical elements into the hallmarks of the subgenre. From the secret societies to the prestigious setting and the murders that occur within it, all is connected to the fantastical elements that she built into the world and it is done in a way that integrates those important conversations that are intrinsically tied to dark academic texts, addressing themes such as racism, privilege, and misogyny. While on their own these themes could easily become rather dense and result in a book that feels more academic in tone, the magic system that Bardugo has chosen actually prevents this from happening. The ghosts, murder mysteries, and rituals are fun to read about and she has captured the essence of the college students participating in these events in a way that tones down the seriousness through their sarcastic remarks and found family dynamic. It was so cool to see how she expanded on these aspects in the sequel, diving deeper into both the world and the characters. The focus on hell was the perfect opportunity for her to show off her craft as a writer, as "the descent" section was pure magic to read, though there were so many other quotes that I highlighted that just perfectly encompassed certain human struggles. Also, I don't know how she had me falling even deeper in love with a relationship that is BARELY there. Like in the grand scheme of things, she was feeding us crumbs but I was gobbling them up like it was the last supper and that's just a testament to her talent as an author.
3125192748	I enjoyed being back with Alex Stern and her chaos 😂Alex and Dawes are determined to bring Darlington back from hell by any means necessary. Whether they have the support of Lethe or not. I found this to be a fast paced read, I enjoyed all the characters including Detective Turner and chilled out Tripp. I’m excited to see where book 3 takes us - after going to hell and back 3 times, what could be next?!
5352874401	~5⭐️~The end? That ending? Really? For Gods know how long?Leigh, come on
6400785695	“Galaxy Stern,” Darlington said, his eyes flashing gold, “I have been crying out to you from the start.”nothing makes me happier than when the second book lives up to the first book. and when it's even better?? 😩🤌🏼“But I like this life better.”“Better than what?”“Better than what I was living before. Better than a world without magic.”this is one of those series i read and can't help but feel envious of both the characters and the author. the characters for getting to live this life, and the author for having been able to dream it up.“Life is cruel. Magic is real. And I’m not ready to die.”one character that i really came to adore was mercy. i feel like she was all of us readers, wishing so badly to find a way in to live magic and leave the real world behind. tripp was a very endearing character as well who brought in some lighthearted comic relief. i did not care for hellie after this book, esp bc the babbit rabbit story.“Fuck off.”“I did miss you, Stern.”the agonizing slowburn of alex & darlington is SO DELICIOUS oh my god i just know the pay off is going to be well worth it.“Come on, Darlington,” she said. “Let's give them hell.”
5607002675	There is this thing about writing a review for a book you are completely and unequivocally in love with that is pretty much like trying to explain to a friend why you are crushing so badly about someone. It will never come out coherent enough to make sense.I can't even begin to explain why these books resonate so perfectly with me they have become my comfort books, but they do and they have.From the atmospheric writing style, to the unforgiving magic system, passing through these delightfully dark and broken characters, there is not one word in these books I don't love. She’d had to watch the members of Manuscript tie a chart-topping pop singer to a chair, and place a nightingale in her mouth, securing it with a tiny rope bridle. Then they’d waited for the bird to shit down her throat. It was supposed to bring back her legendary voice. That was the truth of magic—blood and guts and semen and spit, organs kept in jars, maps for hunting humans, the skulls of unborn infants. So this will be my review.Just remember that romance is not the primary genre in this series, more like a happy accident, but damn, how Bardugo makes us thirst and beg for a scrap of it! A little magic. A talent for taking a beating. A demon at her side. That was all she had, but maybe it was all she needed.“Come on, Darlington,” she said. “Let’s give them hell.” "Was it you that night?” She could see the circle of protection was fraying, dissolving into sparks. “At Book and Snake? Did you use the corpse to spell my name?”“Galaxy Stern,” Darlington said, his eyes flashing gold, “I have been crying out to you from the start.” Maybe they were just two killers, cursed to endure each other’s company, two doomed spirits trying to find their way home. Maybe they were monsters who liked the feeling of another monster looking back at them. But enough people had abandoned them both. She wasn’t going to be the next. They watched each other in the quiet of the kitchen. They knew everything about each other. They knew nothing at all. He had a sense that they had entered into an uneasy truce, but he couldn’t quite name the war. She was more beautiful than he remembered. No, that wasn’t true. It wasn’t that she had changed or that his vision had sharpened. He was just less afraid of her beauty now." “Is that what those things are?”He leaned forward, and the change in him was instant, the glowing eyes, the curling horns, the broadening of the shoulders “These marks mean I am bound in service. Forever.”“To hell? To Golgarot?” He laughed then, the sound deep and cold, the thing at the bottom of the lake. “I’m bound to you, Stern. To the woman who brought me out of hell. I will serve you ’til the end of days.”A predilection for first editions and women who like to lecture me about myself.'A joke. Nothing more. But that word kept sticking in her thoughts—'predilection', precise and filthy at the same time.He saw Alex in the garden, a black-winged bird, night gathered around her like a silken shroud shot through with stars. His monstrous queen. His gentle ruler. He knew what she was now too. 🎧 Pre Re-read[Audiobook]I need a comfort audiobook for my walks so I'm starting this again, since I never wrote a review for it.I don't know what it is exactly, but this series (and the narrator enhances it further) makes me feel cozy— even when it abruptly starts by going down a dark basement to find scared ghosts, blood, and corpses— like it was wrapping a reassuring veil around my stressed brain.
4658487424	Це було дуже круто. Але якщо «9 дім» тепер я бачу як шедевр, то це просто хороша книжка. Мені прикро за такий низький рейтинг обох частин, бо це одні з найкращих книжок, які я читала, ever. Прикро, що багато людей не розуміють цю серію і її складність та красу.Я маю дуже багато думок, мені хочеться розібрати на кісточки всіх персонажів, але домінантою є те, що, ймовірно, ми з Лі Бардуго дуже схоже відчуваємо світ, бо тільки вона може писати так, що мене зачаровує. Окреме дякую за цей примарний роман в голові із хлопчиком з минулого, це просто вищій пілотаж.
3011267461	Quick review: great development on the world building from the first book, buckets of sexual tension just waiting to be unleashed and a whole heap of creepy demonic atmosphere. This feels very different in tone to the first book, less academic and more demon fighting dream team, but I think it works well. Also, who can resist a white cat familiar?
4641131796	This book is literally perfection from first line to last.
3564972335	HELL FUCKING YEAH. This was so good.
4236196889	so many thoughts, so many feelings. quite literally a fucking masterpiece. everything I needed and SO MUCH MORE HOLY SHIT i need to process 😭
5272285914	it literally feels abusive to be forced to wait another few years for the final installment. Bardugo has done it again. She has woven a beautiful story, and like all her other books, the banter and humor was one of my favorite aspects. Hell Bent, the second installment to Ninth House takes place several months after Darlington gets stolen by a demon and trapped in hell. Alex, Dawes, Turner, Mercy, and Tripp are determined to break him out. A thrilling, dark, twisted journey, but I must say: if you come into this expecting the same dark and mysterious setting as Ninth House presented, you may be disappointed. It feels like much of the plot eventually is carried on the back of pure luck and coincidences, but this book was lived up to my high expectations. I especially LOVED the character arcs of Dawes and Alex. Throughout this book, their loyalty really shone through. <><><><><><><>"She read paperbacks too, one after the next like she was chain-smoking-romance, science fiction, old pulp fantasy. All she wanted to do was sit, unbothered in a circle of lamplight, and live someone else's life." Same, Alex, same. "He saw Alex in the garden, a black-winged bird, night gathered around her like a silken shroud shot through with stars. His monstrous queen. His gentle ruler. He knew what she was now too."*high pitched squealing* DARLINGTONSTERN NOW.rtc.
4340231340	"She was more beautiful than he remembered. No, that wasn't true. It wasn't that she had changed or that his vision had sharpened. He was just less afraid of her beauty now."I fucking loved this book. Everything about it was beautiful. Hell Bent follows Alex after the event of Ninth House. She is still trying to find a way to release Darlington from Hell while investigating more odd events and murders across the Yale campus. Alex, Dawes, and Turner are forced to face their past in order to free Darlington and set the course right. God, where do I begin? This is one of those books that has everything. Great characters (and development), interesting plot twists, and a great ending. This book had me tearing up at the rawness of Alex's past. It is dark and twisted, and the book does not sugarcoat the pain of Alex and the other character's past. Any mention of Hellie and Babbit Rabbit had me choked up. I felt like I was living the grief that Alex felt. Turner's section and the choices he had to make when working with a corrupt cop were also so incredibly real I could not put the book down.Finally, we get to Darlington. I adore him, even as a demon. I can not wait for more books from this series because I want to see more of Darlington and his development with Alex. They are both very interesting characters, and they are an even more interesting combination. Although there has been little romance, there are many connections between them and little comments in both of their POVs that show their mutual attraction. They are connected now, after the events of Hell Bent, and I cannot wait to see where the Gentleman of Lethe and Alex's story goes. Overall, I love this series and its dark concepts. I adore Alex; she is a great main character, so raw and unforgiving after everything she has faced. "You have more remorse in your heart for a dead rabbit than for all those boys you beat into nothing." was unbelievably iconic. She is fantastic. I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in her series; I can't believe I have to wait so long for another.
5262969764	Giving this book a one star rating is actually painful. I don’t want to say much for fear of spoilers, but I will say this: I would rather go to hell myself than follow Galaxy Stern around through another tediously long, ridiculously paced book.
5253572563	Is it delusional if I still believe Alex is gay???
5253501902	I loved Ninth House, but this was just… fine.I really missed the intrigue of the societies, who are pretty non-existent here. There’s sort of a mystery, I guess, but it never felt as inventive or clever as the first book. It felt like a story where not much happened (or, rather, the same things just keep happening? Over and over?).I actually think that rather than fleshing out the characters in any meaningful way, we lost dimensions that the first book had suggested for some of these people. People just seem to suddenly have the traits and skills and opinions that the story needs. Turner in particular… And Mercy? Huh.Darlington was… well, no spoilers, but… I’d hoped for a lot more “there” there.I’d read another one, but I wouldn’t be super excited about it, which is a shame, because this was one of my most anticipated books of the year.
4256930100	i'm going to say it, demon darlington... ----------time to go save boytoy darlington from hell i guess----------OH FUCKING HELL YES!THIS! IS! HOW! YOU! DO! A! SEXY! ASS! COVER!!!I AM NOT EVEN MAD ABOUT HOW LONG THIS NEWS TOOK ANYMORE----------from Leigh Bardugo's newsletter, September 13, 2021"I just turned in the first big chunk of the sequel to Ninth House. Usually, I only turn over full drafts, but I'm working with a new editor and I want her to get a feel for what I'm doing in this new book. And... friends, I'm thinking of changing the title. After teasing that the title for the sequel could be found in the last chapter of Ninth House, a new title came charging into my brain and it doesn't seem to want to let go."MY BODY IS READYYYYYYYYYYYYY
5212035882	I’m not sure how I feel about this one. At some points I LOVED it and at some points I really had to push through. There was just so much going on and so much action constantly happening that there was barely room to breathe. But I love this rendition of Yale so much that I still enjoyed being in the story. I just hope the next book will focus on the relationships between the characters a bit more (because the found family trope in here was *chefs kiss*) as well as on the secret societies. More mysterious culty ceremonies less being chased around the streets by demons pls
5188131490	Перед тим, як сідати за цю книжку, я надивився багато відгуків і багато хто казав, що «Hell Bent» слабша за «Девʼятий дім» і з цією думкою я йшов читати її. Але через тільки 50 сторінок я зрозумів, що які ж у мене були хибні очікування. Ця частина нічим не слабша за першу. По-перше, сюжет. Тут вас чекає більше секретів таємних товариств, більше ритуалів, більше знайдених тіл (ну а як без цього) і демони як вишенька на торті (вони реально мене ЛЯКАЛИ, доволі стрьомні персонажі). Але найголовніше - порятунок нашого Дарлінгтона, який, як ми памʼятаємо в першій книзі, потрапив в нЕвЕлИчКу халепу. Тому готуйтеся зустріти знову Алекс Стерн і її банду, на яких буде чекати багато нових перешкод (дуже багато, повірте) і купа різких поворотів сюжету під час порятунку свого Вергілія. Авторка просто вирішила тут розважитися на повну, тому готуйтеся, що відпочинку тут не буде - тільки треш і зіпсовані нерви (я дуже часто хотів кричати від того всього, що там відбувалося) По-друге, атмосфера книжки. Тут і дарк академія, і темне та страшне потойбіччя, яке вас просто проковтне і ви не будете знати, чи покинете його. Також мені дуже сподобалася атмосфера, коли вони сиділи і вичитували різні тексти з бібліотеки, коли досліджували різні локації в кампусі, шукали різні знаки і зачіпки. Я таке просто обожнюю і я дуже кайфанув тоді. Я вже мовчу, коли були ритуали - це було моторошно, але знову ж таки, я отримав тільки задоволення від цих сцен.По-третє, персонажі. Якщо ви думали, що Алекс в перші книзі була жорстка, то тут вона просто ходяча загроза, яка готова на все заради порятунку Дарлінгона, але її гумор, сарказм і якісь уїдливі відповіді просто змусили мене реготати вголос. Я обожнюю Алекс.Дарлінгтон: так як це мій (напевно) найулюбленіший книжковий персонаж, то я дуже переживав за нього. Його розум, сарказм і харизма… в один момент я зрозумів, що підкреслюю в книжці майже кожне його речення.Дейвс: бусінка, дуже люблю її. Її відданість Дарлінгтону і дружба з Алекс просто змусили мене любити її ще більше. І не можу не висловитися про хімію між Алекс і Дарлінгтоном. О боги, такої напруги ше світ не бачив, Лі Бардуґо вміє такі моменти прописувати ідеально. Я не хочу далі нічого казати, бо потече просто річка зі спойлерів.Тому, підбиваючи підсумки, що можу сказати: це було грандіозне, ДУЖЕ цікаве, насичене поворотами сюжету, моментами моторошне чтиво, яке точно увійде в пʼятірку моїх найулюбленіших книг 2024 року. Однозначно раджу, ви не пошкодуєте!

Дуже сподіваюсь, що у письменниці буде натхнення на продовження 🤞🏻🤞🏻 Це не просто фентезі, це також історія Нью-Гейвена, Єлю, Меморіальної Бібліотеки Стерлінга. Я з задоволенням гуглила місця з книги і через Гугл карти змогла ще більше поринути у світ, видуманий Лі Бардуґо. Письменниця зробила колосальну працю над створенням цієї серії. Просто ВАУ!А ще дуже обожнюю її стиль написання і як вона прописує героїв. Вони всі у моєму сердечку: Алекс, Дарлінгтон, Доус, Тернер, Мерсі і Тріпп."Дев'ятий дім" і "Біснуватий" то ♾️❤️
3161302987	4.5 stars. One half burning brimstone and the other dark divine comedy, Hell Bent is both a dive into the darkest layers of Leigh Bardugo's imagination and simply one hell of a fantastical ride.
5250353165	“All worlds are open to us. If we are bold enough to enter.”4.5☆ — my thoughts are an overwhelmed mess right now yet can say this was well worth the wait and my reading experience with hell bent put me through much more of an emotional rollercoaster than ninth house. just getting to see further of this fascinating world of alex's at yale and lethe. along with expanding on the history of lethe, the lore, and endless amounts of knowledge of dark magic and rituals that exist in their world connecting them to the other side. i particularly loved the amount of character depth and backstories in this one and truly seeing how alex, darlington, dawes, turner, mercy, and tripp being such vastly different people but tied together in understanding each other's experiences and trauma. loved reading alex's journey continue and her development since the first book. despite her failures, she has such a relentless determination to keep going and figuring things out even with major costs. also how real the characters' grief and conflicting internal morals are portrayed all throughout this book as they make difficult decisions.a coherent review coming later perhaps, but this was an excellent sequel in my opinion with very few flaws that can be overlooked when it comes to the story as a whole. the twists, the higher stakes bringing higher stress levels, more difficult situations alex is put through and despite the dangers it's balanced out with characters' chemistry. not just darlingstern, though they made me deranged at a lot of points, but the group dynamic too providing so many laugh out loud moments. i desperately need the third book in my hands and hope lb does not keep us waiting years again.
6066964616	This book decidedly does NOT suffer from second book syndrome. This was a really thrilling continuation of the story. I LOVED Ninth House, but somehow this one was even more enjoyable for me. The story really picks up pace, so if you felt the first book was slow, PLEASEEE give this one a chance. One thing that never fails to amaze me is Bardugo’s disgustingly descriptive language. You truly feel everything she writes in your soul. I think half of my annotations are just highlighting the way she describes pain, sadness, desire, etc. Anyways let me shut up before I bore you. SIX STARSSSS!!!
5314465930	Trama/Plot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Personaggi/Characters⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Stile/Style⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Bello questo secondo capitolo della serie che vede protagonista Alex Stern. Come il primo, è oscuro, misterioso e angosciante al punto giusto. Tutto il racconto è pervaso da un senso di fallimento e di inquietudine, stai tutto il tempo a pensare che le cose si risolveranno nel peggiore dei modi, che qualcuno morirà di una morte atroce e che disperazione e follia la faranno da padrone...e in fondo un po' è proprio così. Per quanto riguarda Alex, è sempre forte, dura e solitaria come nel primo libro, e con una determinazione incrollabile a ritrovare Darlington, però comincia anche a rendersi conto di non essere esattamente la reietta che tutti scansano che ha sempre pensato di essere, comincia a rendersi conto di avere persone intorno che le vogliono bene e la stimano per quello che è. Pam è diventata il mio personaggio preferito, insicura e impaurita a prima vista, in realtà anche lei è forte e determinata ed ha sempre una risposta a tutti i problemi. E per quanto riguarda Darlington...come scrive la Bardugo "Omnia mutantur nihil interit": Darlington non è certamente morto, ma è sicuramente cambiato, quanto lo vedremo nel prossimo libro.***This second chapter starring Alex Stern is a good novel. Like the first one, it's dark, mysterious, and quite distressing. The whole story is pervaded by a sense of failure and foreboding, you spend the whole time thinking that things will turn out in the worst way, that someone will die an atrocious death and that desperation and madness will dominate... and, at the end, it is just like that. As for Alex, she's still as strong and tough and lonely as in the first book, and with an unwavering determination to find Darlington, but she's also beginning to realize that she's not quite the outcast she always thought she was, she begins to realizing that there are people around who love her and value her for who she is. Pam has become my favorite character, insecure and scared at first sight, in reality she is strong and determined and always has an answer to all problems. And as for Darlington...as Bardugo writes "Omnia mutantur nihil interit": Darlington is certainly not dead, but he has certainly changed, we will see how much he has changed in the next book.

5144617248	4.25/5 The problem wasn’t books and fairy tales, just that they told half the story, offering up the illusion of a world where only the villains paid in blood.
3975130123	I WORSHIP THE GROUND LEIGH BARDUGO WALKS ONshe completely flipped the script with this sequel and i am so excited for the direction this series is taking! fantasy has always been one of my favorite genres but no one writes and thinks up fantasy like leigh bardugo. i am excited about fantasy again and it's all because of this book.the plot, the characters, the magic, the lore, EVERYTHING was amazing and tense and intriguing and brought me immense joy and stress at the same time lmaoi've always loved these characters but this book has inducted alex, dawes and darlington as my ultimate comfort characters. they are my babies and i love them and i will protect them with my life!!! (i have my eyes on you leigh, leave them alone)I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE LAST BOOK SHIT'S GOING DOWN AND I AM READY
6300876113	Hellbent is an excellent example of what I like to call the curse of the sequels, also known as the transitional second book in a trilogy where little to nothing actually happens.But here's the weird part: things DO actually happen in this book. Lots of things! We have reveals, we have unraveling mysteries, we have trips to other dimensions, we have characters that pop in and out of existence... and theoretically, it should've been a thrill ride. And yet, the tension was nonexistent, the plot plodded along, and nothing felt exciting despite arguably being a pretty big deal. There was even this big, intense event (I won't spoil it, but trust me, it should have been a game-changer) that fell flatter than a pancake. Anti-climactic doesn't even begin to cover it.And that's not even taking into account the repetition. Oh boy, did this book love to rehash things. We revisited the same events in the characters' pasts so many times I lost count. Like, we get it; move on already! For the love of all that's unholy!Also, if I have to read one more time about Darlington's (view spoiler)[erect glowing gold cock (hide spoiler)] I will have to burn this book. And I'm deeply morally opposed to book burning.Speaking of morals, why oh why, with all the terrible things happening, literal demons, murder, brutal sexual assault, do vegans keep getting shit on?? There's even a bit about only vegans going to hell, which is honestly ridiculous within the context of this story and all the evil shit going on. Get new jokes, people. Making fun of vegans for the crime of *checks notes* caring about animals wasn't even funny back in 2010.And don't get me started on the random introduction of new supernatural creatures. (view spoiler)[Vampires? Really?? (hide spoiler)] That is simply a step too far. (view spoiler)[Though Trip is entertaining, and I'm glad he's not dead. (hide spoiler)]The urgency and stakes? Yeah, they must've missed their invitation to the party. This book lacked both in spades. This felt more like a leisurely stroll through a park with a quaint side quest to hell than a heart-pounding adventure.Despite my ranting, I didn't hate this. It had its moments, and I'm glad I stuck with it, but let's just say it didn't quite hit the mark for me. Here's hoping the third book pulls a rabbit out of the hat and rights the ship. Until then, curse of the second book, you strike again.Watch me review all of the 2023 Goodreads Choice Winners here: https://youtu.be/H8A5Ymec0jYTrigger/Content Warnings: death, murder, violence, sexual harassment, sexual assault, blood, overdose, drowning, police corruption, bullying, animal deathYou can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | TikTokYou can join our book club over on Patreon...PBB Book Club

3007885117	Just like with the first book, I feel like I need to turn around and read this again from the beginning to really get a handle on my feelings about what happened. This book is even more intense, and is basically non-stop plot for its entirety. And, once again, Bardugo doesn't write linearly, which adds an additional layer of intrigue and makes you want to turn the pages faster because she knows what to tease and when to explain.Yeah, it was really good.Spoilers for book one ahead.There have been several months in between the end of the last book and the opening of this one. Alex and Dawes have continued with their plans to rescue Darlington from Hell, with no support from anyone, because all the higher ups believe he's dead. Also, a figure from Alex's past is making trouble for her, and her powers continue to evolve in somewhat frightening ways. This book was the very definition of a page-turner for me. I think I read it in about a day and a half, and that was with work getting in the way. I needed to know what was going on with Darlington and how Alex was going to rescue him, and what the heck was up with some of the other stuff going on in Bardugo's New Haven. (view spoiler)[Vampires???? (hide spoiler)] I also loved the way Bardugo leaned into Alex's growth, and her conflicted participation in their little found family (which is slowly growing). She also managed to write about things (demons, hell, secret societies) that felt unique to this story, and which had fresh takes on some old stuff that only intrigued me more. I hope we don't have to wait three years for the last book, but at least this time we didn't end on a cliffhanger. What a ride.
5212184643	i was SO excited for this sequel considering how much i enjoyed the general atmosphere of the first one but i think this is my tapping out point :( Ninth house was already a pretty convoluted story to begin with but hell bent's plot balloons to an almost cartoonish degree and there's zero gratifying payoff (or frankly, reason) to show for any of it. There's just so much going on at all times that it's impossible to keep track or care about what's going on. I think amidst all the chaos Alex and Darlington getting soft-launched as a potential (and probably likely) couple was supposed to be an anchor but since I was never invested in the idea of them being together that whole thing getting introduced was more eye-roll inducing than anything. Reading this you could almost feel Bardugo trying to hold onto the reins but I think this story has just gotten way too big too quickly. Still love you tho turner <3 *spoilervampires? REALLY?
5260553388	~4,5*Obwohl Lesen zu einer meiner absoluten Lieblingsbeschäftigungen gehört, passiert es heutzutage tatsächlich kaum noch, dass mich ein Buch dermaßen begeistern kann, dass ich alles um mich herum vergesse und weder auf die Uhrzeit, noch auf die Seitenanzahl achte. Oftmals fällt es mir sogar schwer, die Geduld und Ausdauer aufzubringen, mehr als 20 Seiten am Stück zu lesen und ich musste mir sogar schon Tricks überlegen, mit denen ich eine gewisse Seitenzahl erreiche. "Buddy-Reads" helfen, aber auch nur bis zu einem gewissen Grad. Ich habe mich schon gefragt, ob es daran liegt, dass ich vielleicht nicht mehr so begeisterungsfähig wie früher bin und dieser Gedanke tat schon ein bisschen weh. Aber siehe da, es musste nur das richtige Buch daherkommen und schon funktioniert wieder alles wie es soll. Ähnlich wie bei "Das neunte Haus" startet "Wer die Hölle kennt" zwar auch eher schleppend, zum Glück aber bei Weitem nicht so schwergängig, wirr und zäh. Ab ungefähr der Hälfte kommt dann aber richtig Fahrt auf. So verdammt gut!! Sehr düster, schaurig, blutig und besonders, voller Ecken und Kanten und trotzdem wunderschön. Ich liebe die Charaktere, die Leigh Bardugo erschaffen und dass sich Alex wie erhofft zu einem "Bad Ass - Charakter" entwickelt hat. Am Ende wäre ich am liebsten in das Buch hineingekrochen und hätte sie lautstark angefeuert. Das Buch hätte von mir aus noch hundert Seiten länger sein dürfen. Die Wartezeit bis zum nächsten Teil der Reihe wird hoffentlich nicht allzu lang. Und damit sich jetzt gar nicht erst ein fieser "Book-Hangover" einschleichen kann, verabschiede ich mich fürs Erste von Alex Stern und Co. und starte direkt mit dem nächsten Buch. Auf bald!
3011739135	Leigh Bardugo has👏🏼done👏🏼it👏🏼again👏🏼Is it too soon to say that Hell Bent is my favorite 2023 book?🫣Nonetheless it's definitely gonna be in my top 5 of 2023 because it's just TOO DAMN GOOD!!NON-SPOILERS PART:► Hell Bent has a different vibe from Ninth House; Ninth House focuses more on introducing us into the Yale societies and Lethe, building up characters and relationships and Alex dealing with the Grays. The mystery is linked with the Yale societies and takes a front row seat in the plot. In Hell Bent, the storyline revolves the most around figuring out a way to go to Hell to rescue Darlington and when that is done, the journey into Hell. There is a mystery but it takes a backseat and isn't focused on as much.► The writing style is still absolutely incredible; Leigh Bardugo is one of the best writers and I just can't get enough of the twists and surprises she gives us in this book😭🤌🏼Like when I think I've finally figured it out she hits us with the clever truth and I find out that I knew nothing at all🧎🏻‍♀️There are a lot of action and quite a lot of things happen that I sometimes needed to take a moment to grasp all of it😩and that made it impossible for me to want to stop reading.► In Ninth House we saw the foundation of the relationships between the characters start to form but in Hell Bent we really saw the characters being a team and doing everything for each other. I love Alex's relationship with Dawes and Turner and Mercy. However, Leigh did not allow for them to catch a damn break! Like OH MY GOD the things they went through😭Absolutely no rest and just one hit after the other I'm like baffled how they managed to survive most of it😂Talk about resilient and strong characters😩🤌🏼Alex is one of the most formidable characters I've ever read about. She's a true survivor and I absolutely loved how she was so unapologetic about doing everything in her power to survive and to help her friends survive as well. And all the flashbacks with Hellie and what happened before Alex went into Yale just absolutely breaks my heart! She has went through so much🥺► On the topic of Hell Bent's plot being different from Ninth House: The new secrets and the world building and the new magic that Leigh has introduced was absolute fascinating. The expansion on the world was so interesting and even better that I could have imagined. I'm happy that we got to know more about Alex's powers as a Wheelwaker❤️‍🔥Sometimes there's this thing about 2nd books in series where it just feels like it's a filler and a stepping stone between book 1 and book 3 but Hell Bent absolutely 👏🏼Killed👏🏼It. I believe that there's more things that happened in Hell Bent than Ninth House and it just got me craving book 3 like nothing else😭😭😭😂I really REALLY hope we won't have to wait years for it because I just can't do it again💔the wait for Hell Bent was too long🥲SPOILERS PART:•••••••••••••••► After Alex and Dawes' failed attempt at reaching Darlington in Scroll and Key I was absolutely shook to find that Darlington was In Black Elm with HORNS!! I thought to myself "this won't be THIS easy" (it wasn't) and it turned out that it wasn't quite darlington and he was trapped between worlds *sigh*. But then, we certainly could've have had him back in the first few chapters😭► I LOVED when Dawes, Alex, Turner and Tripp (unexpected addition to the squad but tbh I love Tripp😂) first went into Hell. The journey itself was fascinating and I loved that we got the POV of all of them on how they became murderers. What I was not happy about was when they LEFT DARLINGTON AND HE WAS RIGHT THERE! When they went back without him I was like "what no surely they didn't😭" (they did) but I guess it was for good reasons🥲► After they left Hell and Alex saw Hellie I knew something was wrong! And it turns out they brought back their demons with them from Hell😭(clever idea honestly) but it was really scary!! One of my favorite scenes was when they acquired those salt protectors; I thought the scene was really magical and dare I say, cute?😂And when they found Darlington's salt protector to be a cat like Cosmo🥹► Before "Part II, As Below" when Alec suspected that Darlington or rather Gentleman Demon Darlington was the one behind the murders (I was shook because I didn't want it to be him😭) and then after when she went to Black Elm and finally understood what happened in the first chapter of the book I was even more shook that those two people that were killed in the basement were HIS PARENTS!! I was like noooo Darlington would never do that😭And then, here comes the plot twist, it was Anselm all along! (did not see that coming at all) and then the second plot twist: Anselm was not Anselm at all but a powerful demon who took his form and was controlling the demon side of Darlington and HE was behind the professor's murder🤯Right at that moment I just wanted to take a minute to catch my breath😂Then we find out Alex was actually a gateway into Hell (say what now?!) AND SHE BRINGS DARLINGTON BACK!! FINALLY!😭We've waited sooo long for this moment omg!And what's better is that we got Darlington's POV🥺► Darlington is back but did we didn't get any *romantic* scenes of Alex and Darlington but we all know Leigh's capacity for slow slow burns and in between them literally trying not to die some romance just wasn't really in the equation😂Though we did get moments with the two of them alone and I'm happy that they're on good terms🥺I hope in book 3 we'll have much more scenes of them!I DID NOT FORGET THE PART WHERE Alex and Darlington are like connected now?! Because she rescued him? "I will serve you 'till the end of days." like WHAT😭Their powers seem to be connected and I'm looking forward to that being more explored in book 3. Also can we stop and think about Alex's powers?👀SO COOL! She can control and use Hellfire, she's a doorway into Hell and according to the second descent, if she was to be kept in Hell then Hell's doorway will always be open for demons to cross into the mortal worlds...That's both scary and badass😌What I want from book 3 is to know about the history of Wheelwakers and how they came to be and what makes it so that Alex is one of them.► I thought the scene when they found out Tripp was a vampire was actually pretty funny😂How they were all like "oh now he's a vampire now GREAT" but I'm happy that they kept him in the squad! ► about that cliffhanger!! Apparently when Anselm drank Alex's blood while she was trying to escape back into the mortal world it allowed him to keep Hell's gate open and now there are demons on the loose??😭But Alex's "lets give them hell" to Darlington was honestly badass I can't wait to see them working together😌Wow that was a lot of ramblings but I wrote these right after I finished the book and I was a mess. Happy that you read all this if you managed to reach the end😂❤️
5260458912	5/5"I will serve you 'til the end of days."Ninth House is in my top 10 favorites of 2022, so Hell Bent was my most anticipated read of 2023 - I was beyond excited to read this when it dropped and boy was this book absolutely amazing. This book gave me everything I wanted and more. Found family, slow burn, a hell heist, murder mystery - SO. DANG. GOOD. My only slight complaint with this book is that we didn't get to see much of the societies like we did in Ninth House, and the same with the Grays - I wanted more! I love love love the character development of Galaxy (Alex) Stern, she is one of my favorite heroines of all time, I just love her so much. Her new powers, OH MY GOD?! (view spoiler)[The snakes...and HELL FIRE??? (hide spoiler)] Also, can we take a moment to appreciate the golden boy of Lethe, the gentleman demon, Mr. Daniel Arlington (aka Darlington?!) I LOVED that we got to see much more of Darlington in this book, I need DarlingStern to be endgame, I will accept nothing less. PLEASE Leigh Bardugo, don't make us wait another three years for the 3rd book in this series! If you are debating reading this, don't wait anymore and GO READ THIS NOW! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
3110940512	I need the third book like right now 🥲 RTC.------------------------------------I did a little happy dance when I found this book at my local library today 🤩 Can't wait to continue with the story!

5471039668	Ha estado bien, pero me gustó más el primero. Muy mórbido en algunos aspectos pero demasiado naive en otros.
4642523933	Okay, yah, Six of Crows is beyond popular and Shadow and Bone has a TV adaptation but HOLY SHIT this series is Leigh Bardugo's magnum opus and I'm sick of it not getting the attention it deserves. Everything is immaculate. The settings, the plot, the horror and fantasy elements, the characters and their relationships, the references to academia AHHHHHI don't even know if there is a point to me writing a review for Hell Bent because no matter what I say, I cannot summarize the magic of Leigh Bardugo's writing. One concrete compliment I will give though is that I love the way Bardugo references literature in this novel. Most books do so by just name dropping Dickinson or something like that, but Bardugo integrates so many references and discussions surrounding art so seamlessly into these characters lives and journeys. One moment that I found touching as an academic in a passion (and not wealth) based field of study was when Alex realized her love for Yale. Despite Alex initially saying in the book that she would have chosen a major other than English if she had the chance, after almost loosing her scholarship to Yale, she later has a monologue on how she doesn't want to live a wasted life of executing mundane work and living for the weekends. She wants to be at school, in an environment where learning and an insatiable appetite for knowledge and human connection is encouraged. As a whole, Alex Stern, and all these characters, are very endearing, but this moment specifically made me love her. But back to my point... These characters: flawless. This plot: horrifying and epic. This setting: beautiful. THIS BOOK IS PERFECT. Please read this series people. I am begging you.
4233643881	01/11/23 update: my mind is a mess to put a coherent review, but this book was one hell of a ride. it started w a bang and it didn't let up. it just kept on going. the twists, the flashbacks, the little world-building, THEY ALL PERFECT. i love my little found family. it's only starting to form bUT ITS THERE. i love alexdarlingtondawesmercyturnertripp babies-----------update: we got a cover AND a title. i am praying to god that the malnourished rabbit isn't a symbol of darlington's well-being. i need him ALIVE and WELL and WITH ALEX-----------ive had enough. i want darlingstern back
5250217158	✰ 4.25 stars ✰ “Welcome home. Welcome back. We missed you. I missed you more than I should have, more than I wanted to. I went to hell for you. I’d do it again.” Hell Bent was one of my most anticipated reads for this year, and while there were some things I hoped would have been addressed, it was still a very agreeable read. It was apparent that Leigh Bardugo dedicated a lot of time into the plot building and all the little details regarding the history of Yale, but in the process, I think the character interactions suffered for that. I wanted more of Darlington and Alex interacting after she brought him back from Hell. It would have been nice to have more chapters told from Darlington's POV, too.The writing, as always, was top-notch - and there weren't too many characters introduced that you couldn't keep track of, which is always appreciated. I love the unflinching honesty and resilience that Alex showed from time to time, and how she genuinely cares about the people closest to her. Dawes also grew as a character in her own right and she and Alex made a very entertaining pair. There are still plenty of questions left unanswered and it does feel like there's still more of this story tell, so I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy whenever it comes out. And hopefully more of Darlington and Alex interactions. Some of their dialogue was laced with so much latent desire, it is a shame that it wasn't addressed in this part. 🥺
