826613140	3rd Review - August 2022I read Frankenstein for a sixth time this week. Although it is one of my favourite novels, and in my opinion one of the finest pieces of fiction ever written, I find myself with a new appreciation of the text every time I come to it. A large proportion of one of my PhD chapters is about this novel. I'm discussing the idea of the vegetable diet along with purity and becoming our natural selves. And I'm also considering notions of animal rights, of the idea that man is very much an animal too and he has lost this sense of original self. Frankenstein at its very core is a novel about duality, of our capability to be both good and evil and to be both human and animal. There is so much to take from this book and there's so much that be taken apart, scrutinised and then put back together again. What's truly striking about the work is how much is reflects the anxieties of the age. It's full of insecurities about nature, god, science and our place in the world. Ultimately, it is a novel that creates a sense of unease because it highlights so much about the inauthentic nature of the lives many of us live. Running through the novel is a craving for freedom: a craving to to simply exist in a natural way. 2nd Review - January 2020Some books teach you something new each time you revisit them. I picked up the tragically wonderful Frankenstein for a fifth time this week, and I was totally mesmerised by the descriptive language used to describe the natural world. In all my previous readings, I focused on all the classic tropes of man and monster though I never considered the importance of the serene beauty that surrounds the story. The natural world dominates the background of the novel. It’s there, like a pervading monster that lingers in the darkest reaches of the mind. What struck me most about it was the fact that both Victor and his creation long for a real life, a life where one is truly alive. And they both ponder what this means at length, reaching the same conclusion: to go completely nomad. They both wish to live a life free of burden and complications, no money, no commitments and no responsibility. They just want to be totally free in the wilderness with the ultimate goal of finding happiness by looking after their most immediate and natural desires. And for me this says a great deal about society, not just the society in which this was written, but society in general: how many of us feel truly alive? Original Review - 2016Let’s have a party Victor. Let’s get together and celebrate all things Gothic, and dark, and wonderful. Let’s have it in an attic in an old house in the middle of a thunderstorm, and then afterwards let’s go to the graveyard with our shovels and our body bags. Sounds good doesn’t it Victor? We could then create our own doppelgängers from the corpses of criminals and geniuses. Then we can abandon our marvellous creation to fend for itself with his childlike innocence, and then wonder why it goes so horribly wrong and blows up in our faces. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. On second thought we probably shouldn’t have that party. Because if we did it would end in blood Yes, lots of blood: the blood of everyone you love, the blood of all your family Victor. You blame the monster, but you are his creator. You should have taught him the ways of the world and guided his first steps. The things you two could have accomplished together. So I ask you this Victor, who is the real monster? Is it the creature that has gone on a murderous rampage or it you? You are the man who played at god and was horrified at the consequence. You judged your creation by his physical appearance, which was more a reflection of your vain soul. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. Surely you don’t wonder why the monster revenged himself upon you?“I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...”Indeed, the real monster of this novel is Victor Frankenstein, and not his monstrous creation. The creature is a monster on the outside but Victor is on the inside, which is a form much worse. By abandoning the creature he has taught him to become what his appearance is. The first human experience he receives is rejection based upon his physicality. His own creator recoils in disgust from him. He cannot be blamed for his actions if all he has been taught is negative emotion, he will only respond in one way. He is innocent and childlike but also a savage brute. These are two things that should never be put together. Woe to Victor Frankenstein’s family. “There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.”Mary Shelley raises questions of the danger of knowledge, and shows a probable consequence of trying to play god; the novel portrays nineteen century fears for the rising field of science and knowledge and questions how far it could go. Indeed, in this case Victor takes on the role of a God by creating new life. She also shows us what can happen to a man if he so driven by this thirst for knowledge and how it will ultimately lead to a fall. Victor reminds me somewhat of Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) in this regard. Faustus is a man who sold his soul to Lucifer for unlimited knowledge in the form of arcane magic. Victor, like Faustus, has stopped at nothing to gain his goal, but in the end is ultimately dissatisfied with the result. Suffice to say, I simply adore this book as you may have gathered from my ramblings. I think this, alongside Dracula, are amongst the strongest representations of Gothic literature. Furthermore, I have a real soft spot for epistolary means of storytelling. I’m not sure why, perhaps it’s the stronger sense of intimacy you fell with the characters as you see their words on the page rather than an impartial narrators. You see inside their heads more and understand their motifs and feelings. My favourite quote:"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. Listen to the passion, to the intellect and witness such a wasted opportunity. Victor, you’re a silly, silly, man.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________
878856994	So.I finished it.Warning:If you are a fan of classic literature and/or are utterly devoid of a sense of humor this review may not be for you.Also:Yes, I realize that I'm a moron with zero literary credibility. So, stop reading right now if the sound of an idiot whistling out of their asshole bothers you. Sure, you can comment below and tell me how stupid I am, but it probably won't make me a better person. Or will it...? I've always wondered what the real Frankenstein story was like...and now I know.Sadly, sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality.And the reality is, this book is a big steaming pile of poo.It's an old-timey horror story, right?Not so much.I mean, I wasn't expecting it to actually be scary, but I thought it might be slightly creepy. Unfortunately, the only horror in the story centered around me having to keep turning the pages.Unless...? Beware mortal! You will DIE of boredom!Truly frightening.It starts like this:An upper-crust guy sails off to the Arctic to make discoveries, and to pass the time he writes to his sister. Supposedly, he's been sailing around on whaling ships for several years. And he's been proven an invaluable resource by other captains. So I'm assuming he's a pretty crusty ol' sailor at this point.Pay attention, because this is where Shelly proves that she knows nothing about men...So this guy goes on and on in these letters to his sister about how he wishes on every star that he could find a best friend at sea. After a few (too many) letters, they pull a half-frozen Frankensicle out of the water. Aaaaand here's what our salty sea dog has to say about the waterlogged mad scientist..."Blah, blah, blah...his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness...blah, blah, blah..." Lustrous eyes?! No (straight) sailor ever, in the history of the world, EVER referred to another dude's eyes as lustrous. Ever. And I know what you're thinking.Well, Anne, maybe this character was gay. Didn't think about that, did you?! Actually, yes. Yes, I did. The only problem with that theory is that NONE of the male characters in this book sounded remotely male.Ladies, do you remember that time in your life (probably around middle or high school), when you thought that guys actually had the same sort of thought waves running through their heads that we do? You know, before you realized that they really don't care about...well, all of the things that we do? You thought that while they were laughing at the booger their idiot friend just flicked across the room, something deeper was stirring in their mind. It just had to be!I'm not sure when it happens, but at some point, every woman finally realizes the (fairly obvious) truth.Men aren't women.That booger was the funniest thing ever, and nothing was stirring around in them other than maybe some gas.And that's ok.Fart-lighting and long distance loogie hawking contests aside, they can be pretty darn cool. But this author was too young to realize that.My personal opinion is that Mary was probably fairly sheltered and was used to running around with a bunch of artsy-fartsy dudes. Much like today, I would imagine these junior emos were probably blowing poetic smoke up her young ass in the high hopes of getting into her pants.Although it's possible I'm totally misreading the situation.Anyway, Frank tells his story, and Sea Dog writes it all down for his sister.In excruciating detail.Rivers, flowers, rocks, mountain tops...agonizingly cataloged. And the weather? God forbid a breeze blows through the story without at least a paragraph devoted to the way it felt on his skin or affected his mood!And speaking of Frankenstein's mood.I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of reading about a character this spineless before. He didn't talk so much as he whined.And the swooning!He was like one of those freaking fainting goats!I can't even count how many times he blacked out and fell over. Of course, then he would get feverish and need "a period of convalescence" to recover.Again, every episode was recounted with incredible attention to detail.I'm thrilled that I never had to miss a moment of his sweaty brow getting daubed with water! Randomly Inserted Fun Fact: The monster quoted Milton in Paradise Lost.Shockingly, I only know this because it was in the appendix, and not because I have any real-life experience with reading that one. Was this the most painfully unnecessary book I've read this year?Yes.Is there a deeper moral to this story?Yes.Some would say, that the monster is a product of a society that refuses to accept someone who is different. Or maybe that Victor Frankenstein was the real monster for not realizing that he had a duty to parent and care for his creation? Perhaps it is meant to point out our obsession with perfection, and our willingness to disregard people who don't meet the standards of beauty as non-human?Some might say any of those things. I, however, learned a far different lesson from Frankenstein.And it's this...Trust no one.Not even someone who (just an example) has been your Best Friend for decades!Let's read a classic, Anne. It'll be fun, Anne. We can call each other with updates, Anne. It'll be just like a book club, Anne. Tee-hee!Liar, liar! Pants on fire!I read this whole God-awful book, and you quit after 10 pages! I'm telling your mom!Anyway.Here's the quote that sums up my experience with Frankenstein:"Blah, blah, blah...in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure."

133726855	“I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.”-From the 1994 movieThe worst thing about this novel is how distorted it has become by constant movie adaptations and misinformed ideas about the nature of Frankenstein and his "monster". For years, like many others, I thought Frankenstein was the name of that slightly green dude with the bolts in his neck. Nuh-uh.Did Frankenstein scare me? Did it have me staying awake and sleeping with the light on, jumping at every slight creak in the house? Was I terrified of the monster and technology and the dangers of playing God? No. Because the beauty of this story is that it isn't the one so many people think it is. Which is almost my favourite thing about it. This book is not a Halloween kind of story with Halloween kind of monsters. This story is heartbreakingly sad. “...once I falsely hoped to meet the beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.” The book offers many interesting avenues of philosophical exploration if one wishes to ponder such things. For example, allusions to religion and Genesis, possible criticisms of using science to "play God", and the relationship between creator and creation. All of these things interest me, yes, but it is the painfully human part of this book that has always so deeply affected me. Because the sad thing, the really sad thing, is that pretty much everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... but so many don't know how human the character is. Created as a scientific experiment by an overly ambitious man, he comes into a frightening and hostile world that immediately rejects him on sight. Even the man who made him cannot look upon his creation without feeling horror. It's that same thing that gets me in books every time: things could have been so different. If people had just been a little less judgmental, a little less scared, and a little more understanding. This being, created from different parts of corpses, seeks love and finds hatred, so he instead decides to embrace it. Fuelled by his own rage at the unfairness of the world, he gradually turns towards evil. He belongs in my own little mental category with the likes of Heathcliff and Erik (aka The Phantom of the Opera). Scared, angry villains who were made so by their own unfortunate circumstances. The kind of characters you simultaneously hate and love, but most of all hope they find some kind of peace.So call it science-fiction, if you want. Call it horror, if you must. But this story is brimming with some of the most realistic and almost unbearably moving human emotion that I have ever read.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr
2285938245	Don’t get why everyone spends so much time talking about “the theme of science versus nature” and how this is “the world’s first science fiction novel” when clearly this is the world’s pre-eminent text on the subject of the dire consequences of procrastination.But whatever.This book rules.First off, it’s very funny to imagine old-timey 1800s people being scared by this. It’s in the same vein as thinking of that urban legend about the people who watched the first movie screaming when the train races toward them. “AAAAAH! I AM IN A THEATER, BUT I’M ABOUT TO GET HIT BY A TRAIN!!! HERE IT COMES! TELL MY WIFE I LOVE HER!”I highly recommend reading it through that lens. Just thinking about that original audience who thought this was a horror. “Oh, my stars! A creature of most unholy origin! I daren’t think of it!” Idiots.Again, I digress.This is so beautifully written. It really forces you to slow down and take the story in, just so you don’t miss a gorgeous line - which in turn makes you appreciate how many great and beautifully executed themes there are at play.Count me impressed.But again, I’m mostly just thinkin’ bout how #relatable Frankenstein is.And also the fact that I can Finally I can be one of those assholes who’s like “Frankenstein is the SCIENTIST, not the monster!!!!”I’m living the dream.Bottom line: This is nonstop fun and everyone should have (read: read) it.-------------currently-reading updatescan already relate to victor frankenstein as i, too, create massive problems and then avoid dealing with them until the repercussions threaten to destroy my life and even then am kinda like "ok but do i have to"
865164753	Mary Wollstonecraft, a teenager, was spending a vacation in Switzerland with her fiancé, Percy Shelley, their mutual friend, Lord Byron, and a few other people. Was the weather gloomy that summer of 1816? Were the companions bored to death? One evening, they challenged each other into writing the scariest ghost story they could come up with. No one remembers what the fellows wrote on that occasion. Except for the young woman’s literary creature and the misfortunes of Victor Frankenstein.Since then, what was meant as an entertaining story, rose to the dimension of a myth. So much so that the original novel itself has been covered up by layer upon layer of external imagery, which has very little to do with it — in particular, the heavily made-up face of Boris Karloff in the 1931 unfaithful film adaptation of this book. Nowadays, there are all sorts of adaptations (e.g. Kenneth Branagh’s movie, with De Niro, more on that below), parodies (Mel Brook’s Young Frankenstein), and probably even spooky porn versions.However, Mary Shelley’s novel is not so much about ghosts or monsters, as it is a meditation on the Biblical theme of Creation and Fall. Naturally, the idea of creating a living being — using some human technique instead of natural reproduction —, comes from the 16th-century Jewish narrative of the Golem of Prague. The subtle hints and overt references to Milton’s Paradise Lost are also quite noticeable — the “daemon”, rejected from the start as an ugly duckling, learns to read with a copy of this book (?). At any rate, Frankenstein is a brilliant and existential reverie on the theme of God and Satan (Frankenstein and the “daemon”) and Adam and Eve (Frankenstein and Elizabeth / the monster and the potential lady-monster).Another striking aspect of Frankenstein’s narrative is the Russian-dolls-like structure of the tales: first Captain Walton’s letters, which frame the whole novel, then Victor Frankenstein’s account and, finally, a tale within the tale, the daemon’s story. This particular form is in keeping with earlier gothic novels and harks back to the One Thousand and One Nights, to which Mary Shelley might have had access, through Antoine Galland’s translation into French. Incidentally, Safie’s story, around the middle of the novel (another embedded tale within a tale), has some oriental undertones.Mary Shelley’s book is considered one of the earliest examples of the Science Fiction genre. However, there is not much science or technology to speak of in Frankenstein, apart from a few mentions of Paracelsus and a couple of other alchemists and astrologers. The minor references to electricity, magnetism and galvanism are in the spirit of the times. Still, Michael Faraday, who would soon bring significant breakthroughs in these fields, was about the same age as the precocious author of Frankenstein. Still, the presence of electromagnetism is not only a reference to the myth of Prometheus and the stolen fire. If anything, it expresses a fascination with landscapes: now sunny, beautiful and pleasant; now stormy, sublime and menacing, with ghastly thunderbolts ripping the clouds apart. Mary Shelley had a couple of predecessors — Coleridge is quoted a few times in her novel —, but that sort of imagery was, by and large, a novelty at the time. It might be interesting to note that while Mary Shelley was writing Frankenstein, Caspar David Friedrich was painting his famous Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (see below). This obsession with ominous landscapes would soon become a trope within the romantic and gothic literary tradition (cf. the often ridiculed Bulwer-Lytton’s “dark and stormy night”).Frankenstein is also considered an early example of the modern Horror genre. However, the general impression is not exactly a feeling of terror. Rather a romantic and quite often bombastic expression of strong emotions: despair, anguish, despondency, melancholy, misery, wretchedness, affliction, etc., are words that come repeatedly under Mary Shelley’s pen. This accumulation of epithets might feel quaint and a little schmaltzy to a modern reader.Even so, Frankenstein has probably been a significant inspiration to crime mystery novels, such as Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and later avatars of serial killers on a murderous rampage. It has probably also exerted a strong influence on scary adventure stories, such as Poe’s Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, Wells’ Island of Doctor Moreau, or Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness. It might, nowadays, become once more a significant source of inspiration, as contemporary technology explores new forms of sentient and intelligent beings, out of GMO, silicon or some weird combination of the two.Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1994), directed by Kenneth Branagh, followed Francis Ford Coppola’s box-office hit Bram Stocker’s Dracula (1992). The cast is imposing: De Niro, Branagh, Hulce, Bonham Carter, Holm, Cleese. The screenplay (written by Frank Darabont, who would later develop The Walking Dead TV series) is, for the most part, faithful to Mary Shelley’s novel. However, while Coppola’s Dracula was darkly luxurious and decadent, the style of Branagh’s Frankenstein is loud and vehement, at times stomach-churning or downright silly.The biopic Mary Shelley (2017) by Haifaa al-Mansour, with Elle Fanning, is primarily a romance, recounting the complicated situation in which the young woman met her husband and how she got to write her masterpiece. The portrayals of Percy Shelley and Lord Byron are rather unflattering.
4896469550	‘’Man,’ I cried, ‘how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!’’For over 200 years Frankenstein by Mary Shelley has captured our minds and toyed with our fears, entering the canon of classic while remaining as relevant and thought provoking a metaphor as science progresses onward. It is certainly worthy of the lasting fame, being an exquisite blend of gothic horror and Romantic morality that delves into philosophical and allegorical inquiries in an endlessly engaging narrative that had me reading late into the night with a fervor to reach the end. It is a story we likely all know, and not much new to say someone hasn’t already said and better, but even still I was fascinated by every detail, with its fabulist monster story, the nested framing of two men on a quest in the arctic, the epistolary narrative, the plots of murderous vengeance and, of course, the fall from innocence with the damnation of ambition. This is also a story about how being a deadbeat dad passes along trauma that reacts negatively and is rather terrifying with its massive monster that moves fast and kills hard. This cautionary creation tale of catastrophe forces us to confront the grotesqueries of humanity grappling with life and death, and question what is truly monstrous.‘Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.’This is a book where the story about its creation is just as compelling as the novel itself. Written when Mary Shelley was 19, this would arrive on the scene under high expectations to see what the young writer of notable literary heritage (her father was William Godwin and her late mother the feminist writer and activist Mary Wollstonecraft) would produce. ‘My husband,’ she writes in an introduction, referring to Percy Bysshe Shelley, ‘was from the first very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage and enroll myself on the page of fame.’ The novel sprang into creation supposedly during a dream (not unlike her doctor Frankenstein’s prophetic dream of creation) after Lord Byron proposed to his friends they each should write a ghost story while they were all stuck indoors on a retreat together at Lake Geneva. This same retreat would also birth the novel The Vampyre by John William Polidori, who based his villain on Byron himself because Lord Byron was kind of insufferable. And a deadbeat dad, not unlike Victor Frankenstein. The novel itself can be read as a commentary on the experience of writing it, something she teases in her introduction about the creative experience of an artist and to which she writes that ‘I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper.’ Unlike her doctor, there is a sense of care over her creation. Now, onward!‘To examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death.’This book is sort of the antidote to those cliche inspirational office posters about ambition everyone had in the 90s, because here we find ambition to drip into arrogance and basically create calamity. Framed from the perspective of Cpt. Walton as he attempts to reach the North Pole—and fails—we hear the story of another man who’s blinded by his own ambition until it is too late. Doctor Victor Frankenstein’s story is a chilling fall-from-grace story, beginning with a sweet adolescence that slowly turns to the grotesque along a path of bloodied corpses of innocent people to chronicle his own loss of innocence. The spark to this is the early death of his mother, coupled with his reading of scientific books at university (self-education through books is mirrored as well through his monster), amalgamating into an idea with the best intentions to ‘renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.’ We all know the maxim that good intentions are the paving stones to Hell, however. ‘Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed.’While we tend to just remember the Doctor’s last name, the full title of the book is Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, and here we begin to understand why fire and light is such a frequent symbol. As Prometheus gave fire to humans and was punished for it, we see Frankenstein attempt to ‘pour a torrent of light into our dark world’ by conquering death and creating life (with electric shock instead of fire but close enough), something that will be his own undoing. It is only natural, drawing on ideas of the Romantics that nature is the pinnacle of good and perfection and since he ‘collected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame,’ to create and give life to his creation, therefore the manufactured (see also: “unnatural”) creation must also be profane and Frankenstein shall be punished. You know, the whole ‘don’t play god’ argument. The creature wrecks havoc on Frankenstein’s life as ‘the cold stars shone in mockery,’ and the barren Arctic is a sort of Hell (devoid of fire and warmth) where Victor inevitably meets his demise.Yet Victor never views his ambitions as unnatural (him and the Captain being figuratively blinded by their ambitions functioning as another fire/light metaphor), and even at the end he says to Walton ‘I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.’ He sees no ethical dilemma in his manufacturing of life, his fears stem from the supposed hideousness of his creation—‘ugly…a thing such as Dante could not have conceived’—and then later the string of murders. ‘A new species would bless me as its creator and source,’ Victor writes, propping himself up as a paternal godlike figure, ‘no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs,’ however he fails as a father to his creation by abandoning it. He does not even give the creation a name, even when hunting it after the multiple murders. This is key, as in fairy tales naming something is a way to take away it’s power (think Rumpelstiltskin being defeated by guessing his name). ‘I think of the act of naming as diagnosis,’ Rebecca Solnit writes in her essay Call Them by Their True Names, ‘once you name a disorder, you may be able to connect to the community afflicted with it, or build one.’ Seeing as the creation turns to evil deeds due to a feeling of isolation and being othered, this idea of naming, of giving a space, makes the lack of naming or any parental care more emphasized as a fatal misstep. So not only does Victor have his fall from grace for trying to play god, but also failing in even the most basics of paternal support. ‘Am i to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?’Let's turn now to Frankenstein’s monster. Left to his own devices, this giant manufactured from death finds he is met with fear and misunderstanding at every turn. While he seems to only have pure intentions at first, he is pushed into solitude and begins to lash out, especially at his creator (definitely some religious symbolism there). While he may be manmade, he is also very human all the way down to emotions and existential crises of selfhood:‘I was dependent on none and related to none. The path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.’ The creature conducts his autodidactic education mostly through reading and watching a family interact. Among his books are Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, and Milton’s Paradise Lost, the latter being very influential on his impressions of the world and themself. From Milton he reads himself first as Adam in the creation story, but later identifies with Satan instead:‘I am thy creature: I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.’Though he also notes that ‘yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone’ Milton pops up everywhere in his sections, such as the monsters statement that ‘evil thenceforth became my good,’ which paraphrases Milton’s line ‘Evil be thou my good.’ In an essay on the novel, Joyce Carol Oates argues that the monster’s surprise at his reflection in the water is not a reference to Narcissus as is typically claimed, but instead a reference to Eve from Paradise Lost: ‘Of sympathy and love; there I had fixt / Mine eyes till now, and pin’d with vain desire.’ This, she argues, makes the monster a sort of reverse holy trinity of creation instead of creator, speaking from Milton’s Adam, Eve and Satan as opposed to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. There is another interesting reversal that Shelley plays with, something William Veeder calls the ‘negative Oedipus.’ The monster kills Elizabeth to get to his ‘father’, Frankenstein, while the death of the doctor’s mother is his motivation to play Holy Father. At all times Shelley constructs a duality of parenthood and horror.While the classic human vs nature and the whole ethical conundrum is fascinating, it is the look at the person under the extreme absence of love and support that grabs me most. On one hand it is an intriguing look at the horrors of isolation and being othered, but it also makes me wonder how narratives like this became concrete in collective consciousness and instill further fear into people against anything different. Is this also central to ideas of xenophobia and pushbacks against equality, the fear that if we allow the marginalized to have space they will harm the people-of-status-quo/colonizers as a state of revenge? Thinking about it that way is frustrating and sad, the idea that those who have been harmed continue to be so out of fear for the repercussions, which only furthers the othering and marginalizing. So I guess that’s something to consider too and work on undoing in social consciousness. And a reminder to give love and empathy. The creation only wanted to be understood, given empathy and space, given love. ‘I could not understand why men who knew all about good and evil could hate and kill each other.’Now the question here proposed by Shelley is, who is the ‘true’ monster? The man who reached for the profane and abandoned it into a life of torment turning toward evil, or the misunderstood being thrust into the world already considered an abomination and becoming ‘malicious because I am miserable.’ Its ethical quandaries like this that make this a fantastic classroom choice or one to toss and turn with for days. The National Theater had an excellent stage adaptation where the two leads, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, alternated roles as Frankenstein and Frankenstein’s monster to further interrogate this question. Though perhaps the creation says it best: ‘Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!’In an interview with LitHub, author Jeanette Winterson says of Frankenstein that ‘we are the first generations to read it not as gothic horror but as contemporary reality.’ Where Shelley’s doctor steals body parts to create life with electricity, in our modern day we are pushing closer towards digital AI and already have manufactured body parts to replace our own. Even just this week it has been in the news that scientists have revived cells in dead pig’s brains and other organs, something that could be a breakthrough in increasing viable organ transplants. Perhaps there is something to learn from Victor’s failures as we consider how to usher new systems into the world, such as issues of bias in algorithms, or if an AI were to learn from us, what are we reflecting back to ourselves. Perhaps this is why Mary Shelley’s classic has endured all this time; with each new advancement in science many fear a Frankenstein unleashing his monster and with each ambition of our own we fear what may happen if we are blinded by our desires. Mary Shelley captures this perfectly and I was surprised how engaging this book was and how relevant it still felt all these years later.4.5/5‘Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.’
3576890133	2nd read:scientists just don't re-animate corpses like they used to it's disappointing1st read:All this time I thought I didn't like classics; turns out I just hadn't read the right ones. I can't help but feel empathy for Frankenstein's creature, and abhor humankind for its prejudice and malice that drove this creature to murder when all he craved was the warmth of companionship.I will never forgive modern media for making believe that this story was about a mindless, incoherent creature incapable of stringing two words together who's only destiny was to kill and be evil when in actuality all he wanted was FRIENDSHIP.I, too, relate to his absolute emo vibes; when he says "Hateful day when i received life!" and "I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous." I'm just like yeah exactly he gets it he knows
1182910	It's been fifty years since I had read Frankenstein, and, now—after a recent second reading—I am pleased to know that the pleasures of that first reading have been revived. Once again--just as it was in my teens--I was thrilled by the first glimpse of the immense figure of the monster, driving his sled across the arctic ice, and marveled at the artful use of narrative frames within frame, each subsequent frame leading us closer to the heart of the novel, until we hear the alienated yet articulate voice of the creature himself. In addition, I admired the equally artful way the novel moves backward through the same frames until we again reach the arctic landscape which is the scene of the novel's beginning...and its end.This time through, I was particularly struck with how Mary must have been influenced by the novels of her father. The relentless hounding of one man by another who feels his life has been poisoned by that man's irresponsible curiosity is a theme taken straight out of Godwin's Caleb Williams, and the cautionary account of a monomaniac who gradually deprives himself of the satisfactions of family, friends and love in pursuit of an intellectual ideal is reminiscent of the alchemist of St. Leon. Her prose also is like her father's in her ability to make delicate philosophical distinctions and express abstract ideas, but she is a much better writer than he: her sentences are more elegant and disciplined, and her descriptive details more aptly chosen and her scenes more effectively realized.The conclusion of the novel seems hasty and incomplete, but perhaps that is because the concept of Frankenstein is so revolutionary that no conclusion could have seemed satisfactory. At any rate, this fine novel has given birth to a host of descendants, and—unlike Victor Frankenstein—is a worthy parent of its many diverse creations.
659664492	This was awesome. I listened to an audiobook on YouTube (as it is under the public domain). You can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuyEa.... It was great. The narrator did a great job of building the atmosphere and excitement in the story. I always love reading the original stories behind some very iconic pop culture figures. Frankenstein is obviously incredibly popular. It was great to read and do a little bit of a personal independent study on (major nerd here). The perfect Halloween read!

2319467285	Let´s sew some bodyparts togetherCreating life has never been so disgustingAnd it started an avalanche of fantasy, horror, and sci fi ideas on how to best pimp one's corpse, zombie, alien parasite, etc. Before Frankenstein, there has always been the idea of resurrecting the dead, something comparable to the concept of creating life out of a modular system with different parts lego style. That´s the Underlying ethical, philosophical partBesides faith, there is an open question about identity, soul, consciousness, and especially death. Something so deeply build into our fragile flesh systems that it freaks us out each time we are confronted with it. Thinking about the implications is what Frankenstein is about, mixed with Borderline science and the question of who is really evilMad scientists are certainly as old as time, although I can´t choose if a crazy priest vivisecting human sacrifices is cooler than a Star Wars/Trek antagonist letting robots and AI do all the dirty work. However, it often seems as if the creature, monster, or übermensch created was the truly terrible thing and not the people sponsoring this stuff. By contrasting this with the (view spoiler)[ somewhat noble (hide spoiler)] monster Shelley gives a Crash course in moralityhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...That´s something ignored and misunderstood in many interpretations and new variations, because it has much to do with one's ideology. A reason for that might be that it´s much easier to create a stereotypical work without much depth than to show the complex inner lives of all protagonists and antagonists. Integrating this element opens up many ethical implications regarding who the real monster is, leading to Too many open questions that can´t be answered easilySo instead of being an action filled or thrilling horror fantasy novel, Frankenstein is much deeper than one would expect. Because, honestly, didn´t many people reading it expect something like a typical horror novel and were surprised by the density of wtf moments letting one stop reading to question humanities and life itself?Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...

1547520563	Mucho se ha hablado de Frankenstein. Se interpreta como una crítica al desarrollo científico, cuando este sobrepasa el curso natural de las cosas; se interpreta como una crítica a la religión y nuestra relación con Dios; hasta se ha dicho que es una alegoría a los miedos que surgen durante un embarazo. Todas estas lecturas probablemente sean correctas, pero omiten lo más básico. Lo que hace a Frankenstein una obra atiborrada de humanidad, con interpolaciones que abordan la desventura a través de la complejidad de tres voces que derraman soledad y melancolía. Si intentara tratar a Frankenstein desde lo más superficial, acabaría hablando sobre la profundidad del espíritu humano y los peligros que conlleva un uso desmedido de sus facultades cognitivas o la influencia del sentimiento en sus actos. No se puede discutir este título sin penetrar en lo más reflexivo de nuestra naturaleza. Frankenstein, en su perfil más somero, abarca temas que atraviesan la columna vertebral de lo que nos hace seres en constante conflicto de moralidades y en una interminable búsqueda por pertenecer y ser reconocidos, como asimismo incluye el derecho a ser amados por al menos alguien en la vida.A partir de un análisis ligero, Frankenstein trata la venganza y el abandono. Son las dos cuestiones principales que hacen esta historia una historia con movimiento. La venganza desde el arrebato y la venganza desde el rechazo. También cabe destacar que es admirable la caracterización del Creador y su Criatura, y sus interminables pugnas por quién posee la más dañina amenaza; ya que, si lo vemos de esa forma, y teniendo en cuenta la completa implicación de las circunstancias en la novela, ¿qué es más nocivo, el rechazo injustificado o el asesinato como consecuencia de una iniquidad anterior?La denominada Criatura, Demonio, Engendro o Monstruo es de los personajes más humanos con los que me he topado. Es suntuosa la carga emotiva, el abigarramiento en el interior de un ser que fue engendrado por ciencia mal utilizada. Un vínculo irónico entre un hombre que quería ser dios y un ser que siempre quiso ser hombre. Para mí esta es la crítica más punzante de Mary Shelley. Repudia que nos dejemos llevar por las apariencias en vez de detenernos a pensar en lo que estamos haciendo. La egolatría, la soberbia y el prejuicio son lo más lamentable de nuestra conducta como humanidad, y esas condiciones danzaron alrededor del llamado Monstruo y acabaron destruyendo la bondad más pura, que, prácticamente, ni había llegado a florecer.No voy a omitir la prosa, que acompaña a la perfección la calidad de este libro. No hay mejor pluma que la que te abraza y te lleva consigo en un viaje por el tiempo y el espacio hacia su historia. Mientras leía Frankenstein, me sentía allí, junto a Víctor y a su Criatura, percibía la realidad que me rodeaba como falsa, como un pobre bosquejo de lo que estaba leyendo, y creía que mi pertenencia radicaba en el siglo XVII. La ambientación de Shelley es tan estupenda que fue capaz de sobrepasar los límites de la narrativa e invadir el mundo real. Excelente trabajo de la autora. Su estilo de escritura es de los puntos más fuertes del texto.Frankenstein se ha transformado en una de mis obras favoritas. Su retrato de la soledad, el aislamiento forzado, la pérdida y la derrota es sublime. Un relato que se construye sobre lo emocional y que tiene sus raíces en lo más hondo del alma humana.
873481652	REREAD UPDATE - September 2018:One of my bookclubs (Click to check out Reading List Completists) is reading this for September 2018. I figure it was a good time for a reread since it was one of my favorites and it has been over 20 years since I read it. I did enjoy it again this time and it stands up to the 5 star review and designation of classic. There were a few slow parts - mainly when Dr. Frankenstein would stop the narrative to wax poetical about something - but, not enough t take a way from my overall enjoyment.I still recommend this for everyone and be sure to check out my full original review below.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is definitely one of my favorite books I was required to read in High School. Also, it is my favorite of the classic horror novels. It is perfectly written, suspenseful, and is a bit more thought provoking than scary. One of the best ways I can compare it to other classic horror novels is to Dracula - which I read recently. Dracula has so much repetitive filler that you do not find in Frankenstein, which is the main reason I find Frankenstein to be a more enjoyable book.Also, I would say that this is more a novel of the human condition than an actual horror novel. Some terrifying things happen, but it is the monster within all of us that may end up being more terrifying! Funny side story: when I read this in High School, it was around the same time that the Kenneth Branaugh adaptation came out at the theaters. We were all encouraged to go see it and found it pretty close to the source material. What was amusing was that Time Magazine had a review of the movie bashing it as untrue to the source material and how disappointed Shelley would be that the Boris Karlovian depiction of a lurching, flattop monster with bolts in its neck was ignored for a more serious drama movie. WHAT!? Time Magazine, for goodness sakes, published an article that claims to know the content of the book but is completely wrong and does it while bashing a movie that did a pretty good job with it!? I mean, it it is okay if you prefer the old time movie version of Frankenstein - and it is a classic - but to make definitive statements that are completely wrong in what is supposed to be a well thought of publication (not your typical tabloid supermarket checkout fodder), that is just too much!We need a copy editor over here!
2415291590	Didn't manage to finish it during my "One Week, One Shelf" reading Classics but I'll need to soon.The writing is beautiful, the audiobook is good but damn the part where the monster tells you his life is boooooring!Update: The Creature/Monster's section got a bit better but overall the book wasn't to my taste.
2543024227	¡Qué daño ha hecho el cine a este libro!El ansia del hombre de ser Dios llevó a Víctor Frankenstein a crear un ser, un ser con apariencia humana de restos de humanos, tan deforme que resultó ser un monstruo en su exterior, pero no en su interior, humano dotado de sentimientos, sensibilidad, que lo que más ansiaba era no estar solo, una compañera con quien compartir su vida y el amor. Ante la negativa de su creador de crear otro "monstruo", el monstruo se vengó.Novela de personajes, que en un momento dado no sé si quién me daba más pena si el creado o el creador, ambos arrepentidos de distintos actos.Fantásticos los personajes secundarios, tanto la familia de Víctor como la familia con la que aprende su criatura o el capitán del barco.La ambientación gótica le dota a la novela de escenas terroríficas, cuando la criatura cobra vida, cuando huye herido tras haber salvado la vida de una niña que se ahogaba...En cierto momento me ha recordado a "los miserables" ¿quién es más miserable? ¿quién es así por su propia naturaleza o quién por las circunstancias acaba así? ¿Las circunstancias que te rodean sirven de excusa para realizar esos atroces actos?Ambos parecen las dos caras de una misma moneda o al menos eso me parece a mí.No tengo un personaje favorito, son todos, y lo que más me ha gustado es la narración es casi como una novela epistolar, a veces sientes una narración pausada, tranquila, con matices que parecen versos con tintes oscuros y góticosTrata temas como los límites de la ciencia y la ética, la responsabilidad, la soledad, el amor, el egoísmo..., con muchos matices y muchas lecturas.Un libro muy recomendable.
1280462060	I loved it! Before reading this book I had heard the story we all know about Frankestein. A suffered no-human being and blah blah blah. However, the story, how is written in general is amazing. The description of Viktor, what he suffered to build that monster, how obsessed he was about that. And then, well, no need to describe how much this poor little creature suffered. One can say "that life is suffered, but many lives are...", and it's true, but everything depends on how the story (or life) is told. About the details in the book, I will keep it for myself and I will just share them with someone who wants to talk to me about this book. I don't like to spoil much.I totally recommend it. A MASTERPIECE!
1615577351	2023nothing like reading this entire book aloud to bonnie because i need her to understand why this book is so good. for me it's because i've never read a book that so vividly describes agony. the mental torment these characters go through and the ways they impact each other will never not hit me hard. i can't believe mary woke up and sat down and wrote this at EIGHTEEN?long story short i am a mont blanc stan and white cishet men need to be humbled. this book is literally the definition of fuck around and find out.--original reviewWOW.One of the most powerful books I have ever read that speaks so much about compassion and humanity. I feel on the verge of tears, it was so moving. This is like Phantom of the Opera times a thousand. And I love POTO.
16392875	I don’t really know what I was expecting – though ‘more’ comes to mind. Let’s start with what I liked about this book. I liked the idea that the monster is ‘made’ a monster by the treatment he receives from humanity. He is ugly and humanity does like to punish the ugly - this is a universal truth about us that in itself is also fairly ugly.The other thing I liked was that standard ploy of gothic novels – the multiple Chinese whisper narration. In this the story is all written in a series of letters and then continuous prose to the sister of a sea captain who hears the story on a journey to the North Pole from Frankenstein himself, even though much of the story is also told to Frankenstein by his monster. I do like stories like this -that are like Russian Dolls – where it is hard to tell who is telling the story and just how reliable they could be as a narrator. I'm not sure I would trust anything an adventurer sea captain told me about anything - and in the end he is the only source.Unfortunately, that is about all that I did like. I would have said I know this story well before I read the book. There have been endless films made of this story – so there are elements to the story that are etched into our collective memories. It comes then as a bit of a shock that many (most) of these elements are not in the story at all. No bolts in the neck, no Igor, no organ playing – isn’t it funny how all of these are so strongly associated with the monster and the story, when none of them are in the story at all? I guess that is yet another example of the power of images. The other difference is that in films the monster is a slow moving automaton, whereas in the book he is much swifter, stronger and agile than people. Frankenstein may not have made a very good looking monster, but in every other respect he did a much better job than God did. Frankenstein is a very fast learner - he learns to speak in less than a year. And given the poverty of instruction Chomsky would really be proud!Coincidences rarely work in fiction – and while they bring delight when they happen in life, in fiction they tend to stop us in our wilful suspension of disbelief. As Frank Smith points out somewhere – we don’t find it hard to suspend disbelief, it is something we quite like to do. The problem is that this story seems to go out of its way to make us do tutting noises at the improbabilities and constantly strained plotting twists.My problem was that many of these weren’t really necessary to the story itself. You know, hint - if telling me something silly isn't going to improve the story, don't tell me something silly.I thought there were some interesting comments about the obligations Gods have to their creations. In this case the ‘god’ is the scientist. He spends most of his time swooning – it seemed the slightest problem has him rushing to his bed for months on end. A friend dies and he is almost at death's door himself. About the only things he never did was tear at either his hair or his clothes – but that is hardly high praise. I guess I’m supposed to say that in these days of genetic engineering and such this is a tale more cautionary now than when it was originally written – but I won’t say that because it is too boring and too obvious.If it is horror you want, Stephen King is much more frightening, never tells you how scared you are supposed to feel at any given moment in the story and is basically a better writer. But this is a seminal horror story, so I guess for that reason alone…
318503794	...and so I was born! A man, and not a man; a life, and an un-life. Hair and lips of lustrous black, skin of parchment yellow, watery eyes of dun-colored white. The stature of a giant. A horror among men! And so my creator fled me, horrified of his creation. And so I fled my place of birth, to seek lessons amongst the human kind. My lonesome lessons learnt: man is a loving and noble creature; learning is pathway to beauty, to kindness, to fellowship. And this I also learnt: to witness what differs, to meet what may be noble under the skin but ugly above it... is to then reject that other, to cast him out! Man is a brutal and heartless creature. And as I was rejected, I do so reject: turn from me and you shall find my cold hands, seeking some bitter warmth... O wretched creature am I!My tale is told by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, in the loveliest and most vivid of flowing prose. A wise writer is this Mary Shelley - and at such a young age! The narrative is as three nesting Russian dolls, a thin one to contain them all, a second of weightier proportions, and a third one within - its gentle and broken heart. That inner story, the smallest, is of my youth - a life of fear, but also of learning, of growing into myself, of witnessing the beauty around me. Of spying upon the family De Lacey - their unknown son. Their own tale is one of bravery and gentleness, of humanity at its weakest and strongest, of survival. But mine is of friendship spurned, kindness returned with terror, a stark rejection, and then a house in flames. And with that burning house burned all the love within this scarcely beating un-heart... all that love, burnt clean away, never to return! The middle story is of my creator, Victor Frankenstein: spoiled child, spoiled man, dreamer, visionary, coward; the foolish instrument of his own despair. A curse upon him, and a blessing, and a curse again! The outer layer is a story of wintry landscapes, an exploration of the icy reaches and the final doom of my creator. It is as well a tale of longing: for justice and for revenge, of course... but also for a companion, for a brother who can never be found. Alas, Captain Walton, a sensitive and lonely soul... I could have been your own brother, such was the depth of our shared yearnings... O wretched are those who walk the earth alone!My father and mother both: Victor Frankenstein. Curse the man who rejects his offspring! Curse the man who seeks to forget his own creation! I was the fruit of his mind and of his labors, born rotten, and thus cast away. The tale of my maker is the tale of a parent suddenly fearful of his young, terrified of what he has wrought. It is a tale of responsibility rejected. The record of his actions are of criminal neglect, of shameful weakness, of a man who lives so much in his thoughts that the world around him crumbles, and the people in that world become abused. My wretched self most of all! And yet I am more than his cast-out son. I am the Frankenstein's shadow self: capable of the sublime, yet enacting the abominable. What is dear to him shall be mine to destroy. His precious ideals shall be the instrument of his destruction. As he would embrace his youngest brother, his dearest friend, his beloved wife... so shall I! And as his shadow self, I will follow him as he will follow me, I will lead him to his destiny, on a terrible trail he has forged himself. I shall spare him, and all others, only the faintest pity... O wretched are those who cross my path!My story is not simply one of thoughtless cruelty or hideous revenge. It is also one of beauty, and of ugliness. Behold the many descriptions of the natural world, the myriad and vivid wonders of nature, of mountain and forest and lake and ocean. There is true beauty. It is a fact upon which we three - Victor Frankenstein and Captain Walton and I - are truly of one mind. In nature there is true transcendence! But alas, it is not simply nature that is judged as beauty, or as ugliness. Inspect the story closely. Note the good fortune of the child Elizabeth, raised in squalor and then lifted into comfort. Why was she so chosen? Because of her fortunate beauty, her golden hair... so different from the children around her, who remained in poverty. A typical act for the human species: forever embracing the fair and turning away from what their eyes call foul. Terrible human nature, that judges the surface alone. Study Victor's reactions to his professors, both steeped in wisdom: one kindly and elegant in appearance, the other misshapen and coarse... his fondness for the former and his displeasure with the latter. See Victor's uncaring and hysterical flight from his own child - myself! Watch his descent into illness at the mere idea of such ugliness. Witness the family De Lacey, and their rejection of one who sought only to ease their burdens, to bring their kindness back upon them - a being who only craved love! Myself! Again and again, the pleasant surface is favored over the ill-formed; the unknown depths to remain unknowable. Foolish humans - victims of their conceits, forever enchanted by what they call beauty. Foul and petty humans - they are villains of their own making. A curse upon them! And so rejected and abandoned, I shall bring ugliness back to their doorstep. I become nemesis; and shall live forever as your deadly child, a perilous inheritance, a nightmare of your own creation... O wretched are you all!
4736222582	When somebody asks you what’s Frankenstein about or who is Frankenstein, the ugly green faced giant pops out of your mind! That’s how Hollywood adaptations ruined the entire execution and make us forget the creator’s name was also Dr. Frankenstein who named his monster after him. I think Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation to the big screen may be the most realistic version of the story and if you didn’t have a chance to watch the play adaptation of National Theater to experience full magic of Cumberbatch and Miller corporation, you may miss a lot! Most people can think this book is so scary, haunted, vicious horror story about monsters and their massacres but this book is a strikingly thought provoking masterpiece questioning prejudgments, ignorance of people. Didn’t Dr. Frankenstein have god complex to create a human being by using the body parts of the corpses? His ambition and his relentless narcissism push him create something that only obey his orders. He’s gonna be god who demands his order to his new son! What if that monster who learns to talk and try so hard to adapt in life was not the real evil of the story and didn’t he force to chose the dark side after getting tormented, humiliated, exiled by the prejudiced people who aim to bully a person who looks and acts different? Could he be civilized and evolved to chose the right side? Probably he would, if he could have a chance! This story never scared me but truly made me sad and made me remind of importance of being open minded. Sometimes people create their own monsters and with their neglect, anger they push him away and force them to chose the dark side. Just real life monsters who come from damaged families, difficult circumstances, biased social circles who are closer to commit crimes! Overall: this is one of the best classics created by Mary Shelley who was only 18 years old when she’s published it! I highly recommend to read the book and skip movie adaptations that portrayed the character like an ugly monster puppet!

525899115	“Um, actually, Frankenstein is the scientist, not the monster.” – Some guy probably.Um, actually, in creating him, Victor Frankenstein effectively becomes the father (in all but name) of the creature. So calling him “Frankenstein” is a perfectly valid interpretation of the text. Sorry pal, but all this "monster" and "creature" talk is really just a smokescreen in order to refuse taking fatherly responsibilities while also maintaining the image of the tortured artist. Besides, is he not a college dropout? Sure, he's brilliant, but I would hardly call him a scientist.Victor Frankenstein’s story is tragic, but hardly a sympathetic one. He recalls his story as a series of misfortunes, a list of mistakes that he’d made throughout his life. But in my opinion, he only really made one mistake; treating the creature, his baby boy, with disgust and abandonment when acceptance and taking responsibility would have changed everything. Despite being maddeningly self-effacing and falsely modest, Victor's actions throughout are especially egregious considering he himself was raised with nothing but love and adoration. How can you possibly expect your child to behave in any other way than how you treat them? “Frankenstein’s Monster” only lives up to the name because he was treated monstrously.
1011642871	Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful. Well, finally I read the original novel after watching infinite film adaptations, variations of the theme and even odd approaches to the topic.I was sure that I would enjoy a lot the novel but sadly, compelled to write an honest review, I have to say that barely I was able to give it a 3-star rating, that I think it's the fairest rating that I can give to the book.The original premise is astonishing, the following impact in popular culture is priceless and certainly the story "behind-of-the-scenes" of the creation of the novel is fascinating. However, the actual writing of the book is tedious, the narration style is odd and the rhythm of the story is too slow. THE GOOD The creation of life has been a subject that captured the imagination of man, along with the chance of beating death and/or getting back from the dead. Mary Shelley, the writer, was able to show an impressive premise that not only is one of the early instances of horror novels but also easily one of the first examples in science-fiction/steampunk works since the process to give "life" to The Creature is through science instead of recurring to magic or some kind or paranormal force.The socio-cultural impact of this novel has been monumental in all kind of media. Some remarkable examples are the 1931's film adaptation with Boris Karloff; the filmed sequel Bride of the Frankenstein of 1935, the 1974's fantastic parody Young Frankenstein with Gene Wilder, Mel Brooks and Peter Boyle; the 1985's twist movie The Bride with Sting and Jennifer Beals; the 1994's film adaptation with Robert De Niro; the two adaptations of Frankenweenie by Tim Burton in 1984 & 2012; and even the outstanding current TV series (2014- ) Penny Dreadful which includes this theme on its merged story.How the novel was created could be covered as a "reality TV show" nowadays: "So You Think You Write Horror: Pros versus Rookies"...watch it only here on GRTV!!! Since all began with a friendly contest, of who can write the best ghost story, between four friends: Percy Shelly (Mary's husband, a famous poet & novelist), Lord Byron (another famous poet), John Polidori and of course, Mary. And the winners are... The rookies!!! Since while Percy Shelley and Lord Byron were acomplished writers, they weren't able to come up with something to compete against Polidori's The Vampyre and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Also, there is the tale of how Mary Shelley came up with the basic idea of the book. She claimed that she had a dream showing the lab with the mad scientist giving life to a hideous creature through the power of a lightning. I won't question her version. I only want to point out the existence of an actual Frankenstein's Castle, located in a town of Germany where, besides several paranormal stories about it, there is a local rumour, that a fellow with the name of Johann Conrad Dippel was a supposed alchemist that created a monster using a bolf of lightning (Where did I heard something just like this? Where?!), even a related rumour tells that this legend was told to Mary's step-mother by none other that the very Grimm Brothers!!! (Ah? Ah?! Try to came up with a cooler legend!). However, Mary always declared that she wasn't aware of that castle and the legends tied to it. Let's take out the part of the step-mother and the Grimm Brothers. It's virtually impossible to believe that Mary Shelley never heard, in some way, about the existence of Frankenstein's Castle and the particular tale of Dippel. Without irrespecting the memory of Mary Shelley, this is just like the story of Diablo Cody, winner of an Oscar for Best "Original" Screenplay for the film Juno of 2007. The main theme of this film is about a teen pregancy. However, in 2005, there was a South Korean film titled Jenny, Juno that it was a romantic dramedy movie about teen pregnancy too. Diablo Cody declared that she never heard before of that South Korean film. Sure, because Juno is such a common name in America that it was an innocent coincidence. (By the way, Juno is the name's boyfriend in the South Korean's movie, instead of the female Juno performed by Ellen Page).American Juno and South Korean Jenny, Juno have totally different stories, different approaches to the subject and even different reactions to the event along with different endings. The only dang similarity is that both are about teen pregnancies. I am not accusing Diablo Cody of plagiarism. That's not the point. I only say that was so hard for her to admit that she watched or heard about the South Korean film and that gave her an inspiration for her own screenplay? In the same way, was so hard for Mary Shelley to admit that she got in contact in some way with the legend of Dippel and the Frankenstein's Castle and she used it as inspiration for her own original book?TIP: If you are using legends, books and/or movies as your own inspiration for your work... change the dang names!!! At least that will make harder to make the connections and even making a more plausible deniability!!! I could not understand why men who knew all about good and evil could hate and kill each other. THE BAD The writing of the book is tedious, or to be more accurate is a too slow burner that it took too much to get into the real story and even worse, once the "action" started, you have again intervals of tedium. It's indeed a roller coaster but in a bad sense, since you took too much time in the tedious way up and the moments of intensity are like split-seconds on the way down. The narration style is odd since the book begins with some letters written by a ship's captain, and the first four letters are boring filler stuff non-relevant to the actual story, and until the fifth letter the story really started. However, later of that, the narration changed to the "voice" of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, but again, our good mad scientist takes too much time to get to the point telling a lot of non-relevant boring details, even worse, it's told in the most tedious "tone of voice" that you can imagine. Without emotion or trying to entertain to the reader. The chapters of the Creature are more entertained but also, sometimes you wonder how possible is that this monster so submitted to rage and murder is able to articule so well his part of the story.So, between that the novel is slow burner, and the moments of real horror with awful deaths are so scarce and presented so quick that you can't even develop the proper emotion on that moments, I wasn't able to enjoy this book as I expected that I would. However, I can't deny the relevant place that this novel has in the history of literature and its impact in multiple ways of the spectrum. Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust?
76182957	If you have not read the book, then you do not know Frankenstein or his monster. Certainly, there is a creature in our modern mythology which bears that name, but he bears strikingly little resemblance to the original.It is the opposite with Dracula, where, if you have seen the films, you know the story. Indeed, there is a striking similarity between nearly all the Dracula films, the same story being told over and over again: Harker, bug-eating Renfield, doting Mina, the seduction of Lucy, Dr. Van Helsing, the sea voyage from Varna, the great decaying estate--it's all there, in both book and cultural myth. Even the lines tend to recur, as almost every retelling has some version of the famed "I never drink--wine."But think of Frankenstein's story, the moments that define it: the mountain castle, the corpse-thieving, the hunch-backed assistant, the silently shambling monster, the pitchfork-wielding mob, the burning windmill--none of these things appear in the original story. The first puzzlement comes when the story begins on a swift ship in the arctic, told in letters between the captain and his beloved sister.The structure of the story as it follows is, in many ways, not ideal. It is not streamlined, focused, or particularly believable. It seems that every picturesque cabin in the woods is inhabited by fallen nobility, that every criminal trial is undertaken on false pretenses to destroy some innocent person, that an eight-foot-tall monstrosity can live in your woodshed for a year without being noticed, and that that same monstrosity can learn to be fluent and even eloquent in both speaking and reading an unknown language merely by watching its use.The style itself is ponderous and florid, as Shelley ever is, which is fine when she has some interesting idea to communicate, but bothersome when she finds herself vacillating--which is often, since our hero, the good doctor, is constantly sitting about, thinking about what he might do next, and usually, avoiding actually doing anything. I understand the deep conflict within him, but it might have been more effective to actually see him act on some of his momentary urges before switching instead of letting it all play out in his head.But then, it's hard to think of him as the hero, anyways, since his activities tend to be so destructive to everyone around him. Sure, he is aware of this tendency--hyper-aware, really--and constantly blames himself, but he doesn't come across as especially sympathetic.The monster, on the other hand, is truly naive and hopeless, unable to change his fate though he often tries to do so, while the doctor tends to avoid doing anything that might improve the situation. There is a very Greek sense of tragedy at hand, in that we have a man who, though combined action and inaction, drives himself inevitably to utter ruin. As Edith Hamilton defines it, tragedy is a terrible event befalling someone who has such deep capacity for emotion that they are able to recognize and feel every awful moment, and Dr. Frankenstein certainly has this capacity. In fact, he seems to have an overabundance of such feeling, to the point that he spends most of his time wallowing and declaring his woe--which is not always endearing.But the tragedy remains the most interesting and engaging part of the book, overcoming the sometimes repetitive details of the story. It is an entwined tragedy, a double tragedy between the man and his creation, and it's never quite clear who is at fault, who is the villain, and who is the wretch. The roles are often traded from moment to moment, and there is no simple answer to wrap up the conflict.Of course, the classic reading of this is an exploration of the relationship between man and his universe (often personified by 'god'). As human beings, we see our lives as a narrative, ourselves as the hero, and we look for villains to blame for our short-comings. the way Shelley lets this story play out between these two entangled lives, each justifying himself and blaming the other for every hardship forces the reader to look at how he does the same thing in every day of his own life.Looking at the tale as it is presented, it is easy to read Dr. Frankenstein as the figure of 'god', the creator and authority, the author of life. We see the monster's pain and suffering and on one hand, it is all the result of his being created in the first place, and of his creator not planning well enough. But beyond that, there are also the actions and choices the monster makes that make him a monster--his own will.But I began to look at it in the opposite way: the doctor creates a monster for which he can blame all of his problems, a force which dictates every moment of his life, which causes all of his pains, which haunts him, powerful and unseen, at every moment. Frankenstein has created a god. He has made a force which can lord over him, a god which resembles man, only more powerful, indestructible, inescapable, terrible. In the end, who is the real 'modern Prometheus'?For almost the entire book, the only person who ever sees the monster is the doctor himself, and since the doctor is present for all of the killings, it isn't hard to interpret this story as the self-justification of a madman: the doctor, himself, could be doing all of the killings, causing all of the malice, and then explaining it away as the acts of a horrific creature that only he can see, that only he can speak to.However, I am not willing to carry this 'unreliable narrator' reading to its bitter end, since the story itself does not quite support it--but the fact that the monster can almost be read this way intensifies to the degree to which it is a story of two intertwined egos, each one blaming the other, like so many toxic relationships between people, or even between one half of a troubled mind and the other.But for all that the core idea of the story is strong and thought-provoking, it is still long-winded, unfocused, and repetitive. It is certainly impressive for the first novel of a nineteen-year-old, and demonstrates splendid imagination, but it does not benefit from her literary affectations. However, her style is still thoughtful and refined, unlike the halting half-measures of Stoker's small-minded Dracula , there is a great expanse here, a wide vista which well-reflects the Victorian artist's obsession with the horror of 'the sublime'.
2545869862	Frankenstein follows Victor, a scientist on a mission to create new life from old carcasses – until his plan, of course, backfires. What ensues is perhaps fairly well-known in popular culture: the killing of his brother, the framing of his tutor, Justine, and the murder of his wife Elizabeth. With the help of his wife, Elizabeth, and his loving family, he must find a way to save not only his family, but his soul. It is amazing that such a basic plot, written in literally 1818, can be so compelling and so subversive. I DIDN'T WRITE A TWELVE-PAGE PAPER ON THIS FOR NOTHING I analyzed this book, in my twelve-page (yes, I know) term paper, as both an anti-Romantic and pro-Romantic work, so if I can just summarize my opinion on that for you: 1) The sublime, an aesthetic category of the Romantic era that I happen to adore, is a especially key element of Shelley’s work, especially in its use of imagery. 2) The romantic reemphasis on the irrational is of course a major element of Frankenstein, yet even the creature’s being has come to pass through Enlightenment ideals – Frankenstein forms his creation through rational, scientific thought. 3) This book believes that science gets us some answers, but not all the answers – even when science gaves us the rational result of an experiment, it may still go horribly wrong. As the voice of Victor’s professor backs up: “The ancient teachers of this science… promised impossibilities, and performed nothing” (30). 4) However, one of my favorite sources instead read Frankenstein as “a critical questioning of both anti-Enlightenment Romanticism and anti-enlightenment science.” (Thanks, Kim Hammond.) In this reading, the book would be in favor of a balance between the irrational and the scientific.5) The book is very pro-getting help from other people!! Elizabeth and Henry, the "good" characters, both help others, while Victor, who is a dick, does nothing. This is surprising and not entirely in line with the Romantic-individualist spirit. Universalism stays winning.6) For what is arguably the first-ever science fiction book, this book has nothing to do with any romantic-era science. 7) The fact that people debate about this is perhaps a good indication of a wider truth: that the novel does not necesarily take a strong stance on how we are meant to interpret the creature. WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT DISCOURSE Writing about Frankenstein is perhaps more challenging because women of her time had very little voice. According to Jill Lepore’s piece for the New Yorker, Shelley was even forced to change her own voice for the 1831 edition: in answer to the question, as she phrases it, “how I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea,” she made up a story in which she virtually erased herself as an author, insisting that the story had come to her in a dream (“I saw—with shut eyes, but acute mental vision,—I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together”) and that writing it consisted of “making only a transcript” of that dream. When Boris Karloff played the creature in a 1931 adaptation, the formerly eloquent, sympathetic monster was not only nameless but all but speechless, too, as if Shelley’s ideas were too radical to be heard – an “agony unutterable.” To quote Jill Lepore's incredible The Strange and Twisted Life of Frankenstein: Shelley herself had no name of her own. Like the creature pieced together from cadavers collected by Victor Frankenstein, her name was an assemblage of parts: the name of her mother, the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, stitched to that of her father, the philosopher William Godwin, grafted onto that of her husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, as if Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley were the sum of her relations, bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh, if not the milk of her mother’s milk, since her mother had died eleven days after giving birth to her, mainly too sick to give suck—Awoke and found no mother. 1988 biographer Muriel Spark reached the conclusion using information from Shelley’s diaries that Frankenstein was partially inspired by Shelley's own experience with losing her children. Lepore’s New Yorker article points out how close the loss of her baby was to Shelley’s first published work: pregnant again only weeks after the death of her first baby, she was most likely nursing her second child when she began writing her first novel; she would lose this second child as well only a year after publishing the book. In this reading, the monster could perhaps be viewed as her lost child, a creation born off the fantasy of bringing back the lost. Whether this was intentional subtext or not, the novel is certainly fasinated with the idea of child death: the creature’s first victim is Victor’s little brother, and his caretaker – who poses somewhat of a motherly role – is framed for her alleged role in the death and killed as a result. Justine’s ‘false confession’ of guilt over William’s death could almost be read as a representation of Shelley’s feelings of guilt over her dead baby; Elizabeth’s transitition to a “grave” (71) personality upon losing her child, her transition to no longer being “that happy creature” (71), could be seen as similar to Mary’s feelings upon losing her child. WHY DOES THIS BOOK WORK SO WELL? Frankenstein is surprisingly still horrifying in today’s world, but not in the slasher-and-gore horror movie way we are perhaps accustomed to: it is a deeply psychological read. There is a unique horror in thinking you’re safe, in thinking the storm has ended, and then seeing it rise again, in a slow descent into madness as your family dies around you, in realizing that just when you thought you were safe, everything can change. Some of the more hair-raising aspects come in small detail – that the crew of the original ship sees the creature and unknowingly let it pass is bone-chilling; that Justine is not only prosecuted and killed for the crimes of the monster, but hated by her whole family, is absolutely horrific.All of these elements to the novel are interesting. But what makes the horror of Frankenstein so compelling is this: we are not combating a mindless horror, but a tragic figure, unnamed but still deeply human.A less imaginative writer would have reduced Frankenstein to a one-note character, yet Shelley refuses this route with her characters. The creature does not lack in the fundamental humanity of us; he uses long words and is shockingly articulate; he acts on both instinctual thought and logical thought. In fact, his one desire is a mate, companionship of his own, to not remain unloved and alone and to find human connection of his own. He attempts to help the first strangers he encounters, bringing home logs “sufficient for the consumption of several days” (88) with no expectation of credit, only of making a family’s life easier. He is by nature highly empathetic, telling Victor that “when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys” (89). It is Victor alone who refuses to humanize the child; when he first comes in contact with the creature, he emphasizes his “unearthly ugliness” (83) above his humanity. This forms the character of the monster into a sympathetic character, despite his flaws; it turns the story into one of the failure of human compassion, rather than one of an evil monster.I am so sorry this was so long winded but I absolutely refuse not to use at least some of my prowess and writing from this very heavily researched term paper. The point is, whatever her intent, whatever she would say had she a further voice, it is undeniable that Shelley’s work has kept significant staying power through every medium from film to original fiction. Yet perhaps more importantly, she has created a long-discussed work in every genre from horror to sci-fi and on every theme from feminism to Romanticism. And just as it has remained a prime subject of criticism, it has remained a fantastically enjoyable book for reading.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
2862234830	In the early 1800’s the author Percy B. Shelley, the poet Lord Byron, and Percy’s wife, Mary Shelley, challenged each other as to who could write the best horror story. Mary Shelley won (to put it mildly) by creating one of the earlier gothic horror novels. Some also consider ‘Frankenstein’ to be one of the earliest Science Fiction novels. H.G. Wells and Jules Verne didn’t come along until the late 1800’s.I’m astonished when I think that this work was written and published over 200 years ago. In the early 1800’s, Napoleon was invading much of Europe expanding its territory until he met his Waterloo. Gas lighting was only recently improved and deployed in many cities in Europe. Luddites were destroying machines in Britain over concerns about losing their jobs. Antarctica had yet to be discovered. It was a tumultuous time of war and discovery.Obviously, the work has inspired countless movies, plays, and television series. The Frankenstein monster remains as one of the most familiar images in horror. Often the retellings depict a brutish, awkward, mute creature, which is quite different than Mary Shelley’s monster, who was agile, intelligent, and well-spoken.The story has its flaws. The various narrators (Victor Frankenstein, the monster, etc.), all have a similar voice and most of the book is ‘telling’. However, it’s an extremely emotional story and much of the narration focused on Victor’s Frankenstein exploration of his sentiments concerning the creation of the monster as well as a series of tragedies in his life. If all you know about Frankenstein is based on movies and TV shows, this original novel will likely surprise you.I enjoyed the read, often wondering about word choice – what was common usage at the time, verses Shelley’s literary chops. It’s incredibly quotable, pick almost any page and you can find an intriguing, evocative quote. It’s not a perfect novel in today’s standards, but it’s expressive and rich with allegory. I easily give it five stars not only for its cultural impact, but also for the pioneering exploration which allowed future horror and science fiction to progress. If you are a horror or science fiction fan and you've never read it, you must!
2511967397	Bueno, Isa Cantos en relectura del 2022 lo odió xD. Cómo cambian las cosas. LA RESEÑA DE ABAJO ES VIEJA.“Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful”.Isa Cantos y el misterio de por qué esperé tantos años de mi vida para leer este libro. ¡Es increíble! Siempre le he tenido un poco de miedo a los clásicos porque siento que me voy a demorar siglos leyéndolos, que van a ser súper complicados, con un lenguaje muy rebuscado y al final no voy a entender nada. Pero Frankenstein (o al menos esta edición) no fue para nada así. Disfruté muchísimo de toda la historia, de los diálogos, la ambientación, el miedo... todo. Creo que todos conocemos la historia del monstruo de Frankenstein, pero en realidad la cultura popular, las películas y lo que se dice por ahí no le hacen justicia al libro. Aquí Mary Shelley nos cuenta la historia de un hombre terriblemente atormentado por su creación, que al verse diferente al resto de la humanidad alberga sentimientos de resentimiento y venganza. Pero el libro va mucho más allá de un hombre huyendo durante años del monstruo que él mismo creó, pues también hay un montón de reflexiones sobre la ciencia, el poder de los humanos sobre la naturaleza y, sobre todo, de cómo siempre tenemos miedo a lo que no conocemos... aún si eso desconocido lo hemos creado nosotros mismos. Es increíble pensar que esta historia fue escrita por una chica de 18 años en el S. XIX. El poder que Mary Shelley le da a las palabras para crear este monstruo, estos miedos y este ambiente gótico es bárbaro.
1772395566	All the movies...all the cartoons...all the Halloween costumes...all the comics...this book has permeated world culture to a degree that few books ever have or ever will. One of the books that I can remember really making me want to read more; for that reason alone it will always be one of my all time favorite books. Highest recommendation.

2140419099	One of my favorite spooky season classics. 🖤Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend. A sorrowful tale of lost love and self-loathing conveyed with divine prose, Frankenstein is one of my favorite classics (right up there with The Monk by Matthew Lewis).I imagine most people know the wonderful origin story of this novel (on a stormy night, Mary Shelley and friends decide to write spooky stories, and the talented young Shelley churns out a masterpiece). And I believe many people know the general setup of a man bringing a monster to life (que the soundtrack from The Hunchback of Notre Dame Disney movie: 🎶"Who is the monster, and who is the maaaaaaan?" 🎵). So it doesn't feel like there's much to add to the conversation here except to say that I was absolutely enraptured by Mary Shelley's prose. And if you've followed me for a while, then you know I'm drawn to lyrical prose and beautiful craft. On that score, Shelley delivers marvelously. I would also add that an entertaining follow-up to this book is Frankissstein by Jeanette Winterson. And of course if you want to learn more about the talented Mary Shelley, then I urge you to check out Charlotte Gordon's biography of Mary Shelley (and her remarkable mother): Romantic Outlaws.
226427952	Updated review after seeing the magnificent Guillermo Del Toro adaptation.Del Toro succeeded where many have failed before and made a ‘Frankenstein’ movie that is faithful to the spirit of Shelley’s emotions and spirit and still manage to be the gothic horror flick people who haven’t read the book will enjoy. His Victor and his Creature are unique; the performances are strong and beautiful. And because its Del Toro, it’s a feast for the eyes, from the stunning costume to the mind-bending laboratory sets. My only note is that Harlander’s motivations could have been even more sinister, considering the Crimean War setting and his vocation as an arms merchant. Elordi is right up there with Rory Kinnear, as actors who have done something wonderful and layered with this part and I am already looking forward to repeated viewings. It is not perfect, but it comes as close as we are going to get.---The extend to which Hollywood has repeatedly fucked up bringing this story to the screen never ceases to amaze me. The only representation of it I have ever liked is Rory Kinnear’s portrayal of the Creature in “Penny Dreadful” (I also loved their, arrogant, undersexed Victor, perfectly incarnated by Harry Treadaway), though the James Whale movies are tons of schlocky fun (I have so much “Bride of Frankenstein”-themed merch scattered around my house, it’s actually a problem). But they simply fail to grasp that this book is not just a horror story: it’s a book about the strange relationship between life and death, grief and the age-old urge humanity has had to ask their maker: “Why am I here? What is my purpose? Why did you let me down?”. Isn’t that much more interesting than a big green monster randomly killing peasants?Mary Shelley was not in a good place when she wrote it: I can’t imagine what grieving for a dead child, on top of post-partum depression, on top of realizing the father will never be faithful or take responsibility for his family, on top of enduring the worse summer Europe had seen in centuries might have felt like. But I can see how all these feelings blended together would have gotten her to think about the purpose of life, the responsibility a creator has towards its creation and the way society shuns those who aren’t like them, who don’t conform to their standards.The story is well know, but bears summarizing: young Victor Frankenstein grows into a loving family near Geneva, surrounded by kind parents, sweet sibling and a loving adopted cousin everyone wishes him to marry. But soon after his mother’s tragic death, he goes away to study, and becomes fascinated with natural philosophy – but also more obscure sciences his teachers dismiss, such as the alchemical works of Paracelsus and Agrippa. His goal? To capture the elusive spark that gives life to what would otherwise be an unanimated body. He undertakes completely unsupervised experiments of a gruesome nature, and the little prodigy, to his own astonishment, succeeds in animating a roughly-put-together vessel with consciousness. Terrified of his creation, and under serious shock at the sight of it, he runs and falls gravely ill, abandoning his creature, who runs away. Victor naively believes himself free of his creation, but when his younger brother is found murdered, he comes to realize his actions have much greater consequences than he had imagined: his creature finds and confront him and gives him an ultimatum: that he grant him a companion with whom to live his unnatural life in exile, or he will kill everyone Victor has ever loved.Victor is arrogant, selfish and careless. He is only interested in showing everyone how clever he is, so I guess eighteen-year-olds have always been similarly insufferable. The Creature is curious, eager to learn and full of an almost incongruous optimism towards life; its childish innocence is brutally shattered upon realizing that the world (even it's own creator!) will always cast it out. That’s when it becomes bitter and vengeful, after abuse, rejection and isolation have deprived it of the simple comfort of human companionship and affection. The real monster in this book is not the re-animated corpse, it’s the man who can’t express compassion.I adore Mary Shelley, and every time I pick up this book, I am amazed that she wrote this incredible story at such a tender age. The poor woman was already much too familiar with grief, but she distilled her pain into a remarkable work that endures and remains thought-provoking and relevant.I can see how some people can’t get into this book: the style is a bit heavy (though not as ponderous as many other classics, and at a page count of about 200, it is read rather quickly), there are precious few female characters (which is a bit surprising coming form the daughter of a feminist icon!). But I think this is a classic everyone who has an interest in horror, sci-fi and philosophy should read. It gets richer every time I revisit the story.
1762012912	Goodreads, Oct 20, 20__TO Mr. Frankenstein, "Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me." Dear Frankenstein! When your monster said these lines in the last, I asked myself also why did you behold the accomplishment of your toil on that dreary night of November!Yes! He repented!But your creation did not remorse before he had urged his diabolical vengeance to such an extremity.What a wonderful man you were, Frankenstein! So ambitious, sharp and determined.How wonderfully you created, one day, such an animated creature from lifeless matter. you became the creator that day! What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within your grasp. You perfectly knew then that the real elixir of life was chimera!You felt exquisite pleasure dwelling on the recollection of your childhood, of your knowledge and invention, of your adventure, of your grief, of your fear and of your remorse. When I was listening to you, I thought of you as the most sagacious researcher of your time. But when I started listening to the evolutionary saga from the mouth of your own creation, I doubted you're being the best mind of your time. The powers of learning or I would say, more explicitly of deceiving, of your creation, were far ahead of you.When a strong multiplicity of sensation seized your monster and he saw, felt, smelled and heard at the same time, I was also pressed upon by a strong light on my imaginative nerves at that very same moment. When your monster unsuccessfully tried to imitate the pleasant songs of birds, the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from him frightened me as well.From his hovel, where he lived secretly for a long time, watching cottagers, learning human emotions, name of cottagers, the language and then about slothful Asiatics, wars of Romans and stupendous genius of Grecians, I tried to recollect the beginning of my existence as if I too had learned such things in similar fashion.Your monster made me curious about the Werter's imaginations of despondency and about the high thoughts of Plutarch from whom he learned such traits! Finally, I too felt my flesh tingled with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly, though not as rapidly as yours, every time when your monster came out of his hide to present himself. Though you had benevolent intentions towards humankind, how terrible it turned out to be!“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand"Your affectionate reader,-------------------------------------------I loved the beautiful writing of Shelley in this book. You may be aware of the story, but I think she deserves the reading of this wonderful piece of fantasy and science fiction work and when you know that she wrote this novel in her early twenties, your admiration for her writing will enhance for sure.It is written in a very unique style and I liked the way, the first few letters started the story and then it was ended in a similar fashion. Multi-layered narration, all perfectly synchronized with one another, makes it a nice reading experience. The natural imagery in the exploration in the North Sea region, Arctic ice and narrator's delightful and full of warmth relations with his family and friends will touch you. The portrayal of the devil is extraordinarily plotted in two entirely opposite ways. Some time he will frighten you through his corpse like hideous horror and at some places you will be filled with compassion towards this wretch monster.“I endeavored to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him" So a brilliant piece of work!
3343708218	What is ambition? A burning and wild passion that makes you yearn for the most sublime ecstasy, or a fervent curse that deceives you into the mental corruption?Frankenstein was a book entirely different from what I expected. The descriptions of nature were fabulous in the story, the misty road, the snowy mountain and the chilling stream. The divine beauty, so peaceful and melancholy.There was also something raw about the story, a wilderness so bitter that I couldn’t help but ponder.The frenzied pursuit of the young mind, the ultimate decay of the glory. A monster with wretched ugliness, a heart filled with both longing and malice. But who is the beast? The scholar or the creation?The book is full of questions unanswered.
4270055650	This is another book that i read in high school, but greatly appreciated it, even at that age. As a fan of comparing movie adaptions to books, I remember thinking ‘this is a hell of a lot different than the frankenstein that I knew.’ For one, the monster’s name isn’t Frankenstein, and he wasn’t just a mindless drone stumbling around. He was a highly intelligent, agile, and emotional creature. The film version with Robert Deniro was by far the most accurate, although not totally, depiction from what I remember, but it wasn’t widely acclaimed. This is still a very scary book and an absolute staple in horror literature. But the emotions of the monster were what I remember the most. From his admission to killing Victor’s brother and asking for forgiveness, to asking for the creation of a mate, his rage towards his creator, and just the back and forth dynamic between the monster and Victor was the highlight of the novel. The ending was very sad, but utterly satisfactory to this tale. Again, if you are a fan of horror, this is an absolute must read.
1619713853	3.5 stars rounded down"His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and straight black lips."I was more than just a little excited to pick up this enduring and quite popular classic, gothic horror novel for the second time. I was convinced that this would go straight to my favorite books of all-time shelf. After all, my lukewarm reception to it more than twenty-five years ago was probably a bit unsound, lacking the appreciation it so deserved. Well, I am not here to say that I disliked the book. Not at all. But I feel somewhat sorry to say that I can’t honestly give it a place on my cherished books list. I also feel a bit isolated by the fact that nearly all of my Goodreads friends have rated this at least a star or two higher than my own 3.5 rounded down to 3 star rating!Okay, now that I have that guilty feeling expressed and out of the way, I will just try to ‘quickly’ mention my thoughts on the book. I think just about everyone here knows the gist of the story. Remember, this is not my first reading so I absolutely didn’t go into it with the expectation that it would match the feel of the film or television adaptations! In fact, when I began reading, I was immediately mesmerized. The beginning portion of the book, with the bleak and desolate description of the arctic landscape and the first glimpse of the gigantic creature by Captain Walton, revealed Mary Shelley’s exquisite writing skills. I loved the way we are introduced to the monster’s creator, Victor Frankenstein. We learn of his story as told by him to Walton. His narrative and that of the monster are woven cleverly together so that we fully comprehend the feelings of both the creator and his creation. Like their fellow humans, Frankenstein sought knowledge while Walton additionally sought adventure. At what point does mankind’s challenge of nature and power cause destruction and ruin? Frankenstein thirsted to push the limits of man’s wisdom by daring not only to learn but to create – a power perhaps reserved for some being or entity outside the realm of our own jurisdiction. "A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs." His arrogance must have consequences, of course. He ultimately rejects that which he has created. His creation is then cast aside by others as he is judged by his ghastly appearance rather than his character. He is left alone and isolated from any kind of companionship or love. The essence of the creature suffers and he takes on those inner characteristics which humanity has carelessly bestowed him with – he becomes a monster. Both creator and monster suffer as a result of their individual actions and consciences. Victor Frankenstein laments: "Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me, which nothing could extinguish." The monster bemoans: "Remember, that I am thy creature: I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Every where I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend." Undeniably, there is a strong message within this book, and it is delivered quite clearly by Shelley’s powerful writing. This aspect of the novel definitely appeals to me. As do the descriptions of the scenery – the majestic Alps, the serenity of the Rhine river valley, and the stark and relentless ice of the arctic. What caused my rating to dip further than I had hoped was the endless wailing of Victor Frankenstein. Much of the narrative became rather repetitive, resulting in my wish to hurry along to the end. So I suppose it is fair to say that while the moral of the story and the brilliance of Mary Shelley are to be commended, especially given the time in which this was written, my ultimate enjoyment was a tad diminished. Of course, her ideas have relevance even today, as mankind still seeks that which is just beyond its grasp.
1430149705	Frankenstein is the doctor – a man named Victor Frankenstein – and not the monster, who is usually called “the creature” to emphasize his status as a being created by Frankenstein the doctor. I wish more people were aware of that distinction. Those matters of nomenclature aside, we can all agree that, from the time of its publication in 1818, Frankenstein has held a peculiar power to shock and horrify. Mary Shelley's novel, written as part of an informal ghost-story contest, struck a chord that still resonates today, more than 200 years later. It is not just a classic of horror or terror; it is a classic, period.And yet it is a classic that can be hard to get in touch with. Maybe I'm thinking about this because I have recently observed my Halloween tradition of watching James Whale's film Frankenstein (1931). The undeniable power of this film, and of Boris Karloff's moving portrayal of the monster, does not make it a substitute for the book; and some of the film's stylistic flourishes (the anachronistic science-lab machinery, Jack Pierce's unforgettable makeup for the monster) have become a part of our culture - so much so that it is difficult to get past said stylistic flourishes and make our way back to the original novel.And what a novel it is. The Modern Prometheus, the original subtitle for the book, makes very clear the parallel that Shelley wishes to draw between the mythical Titan who stole fire from the gods, and the German scientist who sought to create his own form of life from dead tissue. And like Prometheus before him, Victor Frankenstein suffers unending torment for his offense against divine will.Frankenstein is, among other things, a masterpiece of concision. Dracula, written 80 years later, reflects the sprawling grandeur of the Victorian era; Frankenstein, although written a good 20 years into the Romantic era, is as crisply succinct as an Enlightenment-era scientific equation. At the same time, it has the remote, dreamlike qualities of nightmare, and aligns well with the then-new Romantic movement. Shelley describes, in a preface to the 1831 edition of Frankenstein, the nightmare that inspired the novel that has inspired so many subsequent nightmares:I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion.It is, at its heart, a framed tale. We begin with letters of Captain Robert Walton, an explorer seeking a passage through the frozen seas of the north. Captain Walton unexpectedly encounters a European man upon a floe of ice (after getting a brief glimpse of "a being which had the shape of a man, but of gigantic stature," guiding a sled across the ice). The European, a scientist named Victor Frankenstein, then unfolds his tragic story.A recounting of the difficult circumstances of Frankenstein's early life quickly gives way to a chronicling of his obsession with giving life to the dead. When Frankenstein succeeds in giving life to his creature, the passage is one of my favorite in all of literature:It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.Frankenstein's arduous labor at constructing his creature is matched only by the revulsion he feels once the creature is alive. Another essential passage:How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! -- Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.Jack Pierce's excellent monster makeup for the James Whale films notwithstanding, I don't know if any cinematic makeup artist could truly do justice to that description. One gets such a strong sense from that passage that what causes Frankenstein to reject his creature in such a dramatic, atavistic way is the way in which life flows unnaturally within the creature. It is a form of life that has never existed on earth, and all other living things seem to flee from it, as if by instinct.As we all know by now, the monster does not respond well to rejection. Who among us does? But the monster's vengeance against his creator is a terrible thing to contemplate. Victor's younger brother William is murdered, and the boy's nanny, Justine Moritz, is implicated in the crime and hanged for it. When the monster seeks out Frankenstein and demands that the doctor make him a mate, the doctor initially agrees, but then destroys the partially made she-monster (this is as close as the novel ever gets to a "bride of Frankenstein"), and the monster subsequently turns his vengeful attentions toward Frankenstein's fiancée Elizabeth.There is a kind of terrible logic to that. After all, Frankenstein, in creating the monster, has already engaged in his own one-man act of asexual reproduction; he has already decided that he does not need a woman in order to pass on life in the traditional way. What wonder, then, that the monster threatens to take the life of Frankenstein's wife, as the monster's own bride was destroyed while only partially complete? It is particularly fascinating to consider this tale told by a woman author as a critique of the male-dominated scientific mindset of the time, and of patriarchy and misogyny generally.One of the terrible beauties of this novel is hearing the monster speak. The monster educated himself during the time when he took refuge near a remote cottage; his reading list includes Plutarch’s Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, John Milton’s Paradise Lost, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther. The books constitute a nice mix of the classical, the early modern, and the Romantic, as well as a look ahead to the monster’s status as a sorrowing Romantic, like Goethe’s Werther – and as a creature who will wreak harm in response to feeling wronged, like Milton’s Satan. His self-administered education in hand, the monster is downright eloquent. Most of the Frankenstein monsters of the silver screen – and he’s been played by quite an array of actors: Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr., Christopher Lee, Robert De Niro, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Sarrazin, Peter Boyle, Randy Quaid, Kevin James, Charles Dance, Clancy Brown, David Prowse – have been assigned a vocabulary of grunts. It's difficult to imagine the majority of them saying, as the monster in Shelley's novel says to Victor, "Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?"Inexorable as one of the cataracts of the frozen north where the novel begins and ends, Frankenstein moves grimly, irrevocably, toward its tragic conclusion. It is a singularly well-written and evocative novel. Like the Frankenstein monster itself, the novel Frankenstein is a profoundly disturbing creation.

1806916199	I’d forgotten the epistolary underpinnings here. It’s certainly past due for a rereading. Published 201 years ago, it’s hard to believe how honeyed the language is, how spare. Only the old fashioned vocabulary dates it, but that in a good way. I recall how Iain Pears so adeptly evoked the 17th century by way of a bit of judiciously used archaic vocabulary in An Instance of the Fingerpost, which is exquisite, being his Rashomon. Shelley’s writing stays on the surface; one doesn’t get lost in introspection or endless digressions. Fascinating to see again how the dark possibilities of science concerned Shelley. This foreboding is still with us as China begins using CRISPR to create GMO people. And check out this headline from CNN: “It's 2019, and scientists can now revive brain cells in a decapitated pig hours after death.” So Shelley’s cautionary tale has not dated. If anything it’s more pertinent now. The speed with which the story unfolds is key to its success. My admiration is only renewed as I read. I mean, the focus of the story is faultless, and as it runs on it also, quite apart from the horror story, has a way of charming one such is the tidy economy with which it proceeds. Edmund White would call this a Chinese box narrative: a story (the monster’s) inside a story (Victor Frankenstein’s), inside a story (the arctic explorer Robert Walton’s). Now I see what I did not before, that the monster is epistemologically inconsistent. His fine diction and vocabulary have no source; how were they learned and when? He speaks of how miserably lonely he is, how wretched. This presumes a past, socialization, lived experience; if so, these may be inklings of his former life, which reanimation has blurred, as in a palimpsest.It turns out that all the creature’s language was learned by eavesdropping on a family of cottagers. One is an Arab and as she is taught English so the monster learns too. Then he finds Plutarch, Goethe and Milton lying in the woods. It’s a wearying contrivance; yet somehow one is dragged along out of sympathy for the monster—especially when he rhapsodizes about reading. The parallels between the monster’s situation and Adam’s in Paradise Lost is brilliantly contrasted. The creature has no Eve. When we return to Dr. Frankenstein’s narrative, after his promise to the creature on the glacier, that he will create a female monster, we feel as we read that the the doctor’s dark mood and general depression and misery, effectively echo that espoused by his creation. This is deftly done. Nothing separates the two men in their basic need for companionship and love. The creature seems the more rational of the two, but he is also desperate in his loneliness, thus his threat against the mad doctor’s loved ones.The doctor is clearly in denial throughout about the implications of his work. He’s naive and underestimates the cunning of his creation again and again. As for the monster, he is, after reading Milton, in rebellion against an unfair and cruel god—Frankenstein. But unlike human beings who believe in God, the monster’s god is of flesh and bones and all too responsive to the displeasure of his creation. Sustained throughout is the ability of both men—creature and creator—to suffer what is at bottom the same misery, though in the creature’s case it is the solitariness enforced by his monstrousness, for the doctor it is the personal loss of loved ones. Finally, in the doctor’s mad pursuit of his tormentor, onto the frozen Arctic Ocean, we see that he has indeed become what the creature wanted all along, a companion, though one borne of rage and vengeance. Still, one thinks, it’s more than the monster’s ever known before.
1074807221	It is almost a pity that the story of Frankenstein is so well known because far too many people neglect to bother reading Mary Shelley’s novel under the assumption that they already know the story. This is a shame because Frankenstein is beautifully written, very dark and scary but also quite poignant. Most people have an image of Frankenstein’s Monster as a shambling massive thing with bolts on its neck, going around mumbling GAAHHH GAAAAAH!!! and snapping people’s necks because that is how he rolls. Some people even call the Monster “Frankenstein” which is really a faux pas as that is the name of Victor Frankenstein who created him (though if things had turned out differently and Victor had adopted The Monster as a family member then he would have been rightly called Mr. Frankenstein!).What happens to Victor’s nearest and dearest is quite horrifying even though all the violence happen “off screen” in that the Monster’s murderous rampage is not described in the narrative, the reader is only shown the final result. Somehow this makes the story even more believable and creepy. Classic illustration by Theodor von Holst, pilfered from WikipediaThe way I see it the real monster of the story is Victor, not The Monster. Imagine how things would have worked out if, instead of making a run for it when the Monster wakes up, he welcomes The Monster into the world, make him a nice cuppa tea, and help him to find a place in society. If he is really so ugly just buy him a mask and a hat or something. His reaction also seems to be illogical, while he was stitching the Monster together he must have noticed how fugly the poor thing looks, how is it that he only realizes it as the thing was waking up? How the Monster learns to speak, read and write entirely from observing some neighbors is also not quite believable, it reminds me of Tarzan figuring out how to read all by himself in Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan of the Apes; rather preposterous. That said Mary Shelly’s prose is so beautifully written I was quite willing to suspend disbelief. Victor is an obsessed mad scientist who runs away from his responsibility and in spite of advance warnings still endangered his family and friends. The Monster is surprisingly eloquent in his speech and comes across as very pitiful and poorly treated by everyone he come across; by his “father” most of all. One point he often comes back to is that he never asked to be born and that if he can not get the love he yearns for he will take revenge as a substitute: "Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed.”“There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.” Poor bastard. There are myriad themes in this book, but the most salient one for me is prejudice based on physical appearances. The Monster wants to be loved and accepted can only take so many rejections and abuse before he goes berserk. Victor gave him life but denies him everything else, he is the real villain of the piece.Mary’s Shelly’s prose is lyrical to the point of being flowery at times. Besides being a morality tale Frankenstein is also a prototype science fiction book, it is amazing that it is written by the wife of a famous poet. It is a terrible shame that she did not write more novels of this kind. Children may find the language a little too flowery and the narrative does go to some very dark places. However, I would recommend this book to just about everybody else. Certainly I would like to read it again one day. Notes:• This book was “listened to” in audiobook format, nicely and graciously read by Caden Vaughn Clegg for Librivox.org (free public domain audiobooks). Thank you sir!(Download link)• Paul McGuigan, the director of Victor Frankenstein (2015), said that Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is "as dull as dishwater", what this indicates to me is that McGuigan has no understanding of subtlety or nuances. The simple fact that he made a movie based on a book he neither fully understand or respects is enough for me to avoid it like the plague.• On a similar note.

3442940142	Primero que nada, es una pena que el Frankenstein conocido por el mundo sea el de Hollywood y no el de Shelley. Segundo, si aún no se han leído esta obra, no lo empujen más. Pero háganme un favor. Borren toda esa mierda de terror que se habla en las películas, hagan de cuenta que no existe y está es su primera vez oyendo de Frankenstein. Porque esa es la idea con que he ido y terminé completamente encantada con la historia. Mary Shelley presenta un conflicto moral, que involucra la ambición, el mal uso del conocimiento y el conflicto emocional que una decisión tomada en orden de la fascinación puede causar. Es una obra melancólica. No hay un sólo personaje enteramente bueno o enteramente malo. Todos tienen su razón de ser. Son totalmente humanos, incluso cuando no deberían serlo. La compasión te guía a muchos lados, pero al mismo tiempo no eres capaz de ignorar los sucesos que toman lugar en la historia. Es una obra maravillosa. Que espero el mundo recuerde por lo que es en papel y no lo que representa el cine de terror. (Pero si alguien sabe de alguna adaptación que sea fiel a la obra, favor de decirme.)
6892049753	This is 1 of the few “classic” novels I once left in a DNF state. I only managed to finish it, in fits and starts, after several years of reading.The story itself is essentially a human fantasy from 200 years ago. Its tone is set very high - in the history of literature, it is universally acknowledged as the world’s first sci-fi novel. Personally, I feel that in the history of sci-fi, only the fact that it’s the “first” holds any real value; nothing more. And although it’s labeled as sci-fi, the emphasis is solely on that concept. In reality, there’s very little focus on scientific or technological detail - instead, a huge portion of the text is devoted to internal monologue, which makes the narrative rather dry and ultimately left me quite disappointed.The plot is very simple. Frankenstein ambitiously creates a hideously ugly giant, hoping to earn reverence as the creator of life. But the creature he creates does not obey his wishes; instead, it goes on to murder Frankenstein’s loved ones 1 after another, devastating the once-happy Frankenstein both physically and emotionally.This seems to reveal 1 of the major themes of modern civilization: humanity’s reckless conquest of nature and its desire to change natural laws inevitably invites retribution. Our world today is surrounded by machines. Although machines appear lifeless, they are not entirely under our control. The machines we invent, much like Frankenstein’s giant, have a will of their own that isn’t bound by us. Cars bring convenience but also accidents and death; mobile phones break down spatial barriers, yet we become inundated with harassing messages, ads, and junk information. Air pollution, genetically modified foods, cloning - these are just some of the troubles that advanced technology continues to hound us with. Technology has unleashed an explosion in productivity but has also led to mass unemployment, reducing human labor to repetitive, mechanical tasks. As we relentlessly demand more from technology, it, like Frankenstein’s monster, keeps retaliating against us.From a sci-fi perspective, by the time you’re halfway through the book, there isn’t any mention of sci-fi or related events at all. It’s only much later that the creature is revealed to have been created - and the creator turns out to be a college graduate with a keen interest in biology. The resulting form is abnormally ugly, like a rat scurrying down the street, despised by everyone. The creature is defined simply as “an inorganic substance that’s come to life.”I really never expected that reading this novel could be so distracting - if I hadn’t really forced myself, I wouldn’t have been able to get into the characters’ inner worlds.Maybe the story is just too ordinary and mundane. With its single, straightforward storyline and no real twists or turns, it has some narrative but can’t overcome its dull plot. By the middle of it, I’d already lost interest, yet I stuck with it because I’ve always believed that if you don’t finish a book, you don’t have the right to judge it. I expected it to leave some suspense - for example, that the creature might eventually escape to someplace, remaining unconquered by humanity - but it ended up being a closed loop. It can’t be called a happy ending for a whole family, but at least it was a proper beginning-to-end finish.Finally, about the title: Frankenstein is the surname of the protagonist. I still don’t understand the purpose of naming the book after a fictional character’s last name. Also, I haven’t figured out whether this artificial being serves as a metaphor for reality. Looking at the creature’s journey from beginning to end, I couldn’t discern any distinct sadness that belonged solely to it. Typically, academic circles extol this book, and I can easily imagine various scholars praising it from every angle - how it represents the chaos of its era, how it hints at the darkness of the rulers, how the protagonist’s inner torment reveals the value of life, and so on. Even after referring many reviews, nothing concrete emerges.To sum up, as the first sci-fi novel in literary history, perhaps only the fact of its “first” status holds any value; as literature, sci-fi, or a novel, I feel this book doesn’t deserve the title. Sorry. For middle school students, it might be worth a try as extracurricular reading, since its ideas are somewhat uplifting. But for an old-timer like me, it’s just not for me.2.4 / 5 stars
6898732	Whoh this is so lame I say : avoid. I thought Frankenstein would rock but it really doesn't. I seen a lot of Frankenstein movies and this is nothing like them. There are no vampires like in Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein, there are no lesbians like in Lust for Frankenstein, there are no SKs like in Frankenstein was Jack the Ripper, there is just jawbreaking philosophical like debate, well it would break your jaw in four places if you tried to read this stuff out aloud. I fell asleep five times during the reading of a single page. True. Now the author was a young girl she was like only 15 and she was living a pretty wild rock & roll lifestyle with a bunch of poets at the time but you wouldn't know from this book, there's no sex in it, there's some murders and body parts but man not enough for me, Frankenstein doesn't even get burned in the end or eaten by nymphomaniacs like in Frankenstein vs the Nymphomaniacs, he just like wanders off into the Arctis. Not realistic at all.
838234102	WOW! This book was a revelation. Nothing like my vague memories of the classic Boris Karloff movie, there is so MUCH more to it!! I picked it up for classics group, so was not just reading for enjoyment. First the use of language is beautiful and when describing locales is quite stunning. Shelley alludes to a number of classics, that at times I had to either look up or reach into the recesses of my memory to get the point. The themes of friendship, pushing the boundaries, ego, ambition, love, God vs. Man, science vs. religion are woven throughout, but the first-friendship was overpowering in it's pull for me. I felt the keen loneliness and desperation of the creature that early on made him so sympathetic; unfortunately when spurned by others he turned; to quote from Star Wars; "to the dark side" and let rage and vengeance engulf him and drive him to murder. I found Victor Frankenstein totally unsympathetic and he got his just desserts, unfortunately was also the catalyst for the loss of innocent lives.So is this early science fiction? Horror? It is considered to be written in the Gothic style of the day. I don't know. I gave it 5 stars because it is just an amazing story written on a dare by a young woman of 18, although fleshed out when she was much older (34), and that it has lasted and inspired many other permutations.

3338346436	I really enjoyed this one. The story overall was a tragic one. But the tragedy was a result of Doctor Frankenstein: he was the victim of his own genius. He started out a bright yet overzealous university student mastering his studies. He soon gets the idea of creating life, but creating life for power. His attempt at creating life fails as he creates a grotesque abomination. The monster eventually becomes self-aware and formulates the singleminded goal of destroying his creator. Over time the monster begins psychologically terrorizing Victor Frankenstein and the two clash.I liked the science-fiction/gothic/horror elements layered in the story. I also found it to be thought-provoking and deep. The analogy of Prometheus who stole fire and created life, Biblical references and allusions to Milton's 'Paradise Lost', and the phrase 'Who's to blame: the monster or the creator?' The only Frankenstein movie I've seen is the 1994 version starring Kenneth Branagh as Victor and Robert De Niro as The Monster. I enjoyed this film even though there are adaptations from the book.Overall the readability was good and reminded me of some Robert Louis Stevenson. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys thought-provoking classical literature. Thanks!
6929244176	I thought I knew the story of Frankenstein, more or less. I think I saw the movie as a child (though it’s possible I am misremembering—that rather than watching Frankenstein and also Young Frankenstein, I merely saw Young Frankenstein twice). So I was surprised when I opened Mary Shelley’s novel and found myself in St. Petersburg, about to set out on an arctic expedition. Then I was surprised all over again when the story I knew—mad scientist gives life to sewn-together man in laboratory—was more or less dispensed of within the first thirty pages. Wait a second, I thought, what is this book actually about? Many things, as it turns out. God and Nature. Life and death. The body and the soul. Love and isolation. Ambition and debasement. Self-delusion and truth. Incest. Frankenstein’s monster is hideous, so hideous that no human being can stand his presence, can even imagine that he might be other than evil. He is not hideous because of his appearance, though surely his is one ugly mug. Nor because of his soul (though it is not entirely clear if he has one, or if such things as souls exist in this universe). Nor because he does evil things. Frankenstein is hideous because he must be. Because how could he be otherwise? Because, in Mary Shelley’s own words (from the novel’s 1831 preface), “supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.” Frankenstein’s monster is not ugly, he is unspeakable. And yet, Mary Shelley shows great sympathy for her monster; more sympathy, by far, than she shows her hero. That tension, between Dr. Frankenstein, the brilliant, visionary fool; the loving, sensitive egomaniac; and his creation, who is as sensitive, as noble, as thoughtful and caring, and as horrible, as guilty, as damned as his creator—that tension fires the novel, which, as Frankenstein chases his monster across the ice, becomes almost a parody of a battle between good and evil. Good and evil? Innocence and guilt? Irrelevant and useless categories, utterly lacking in explanatory power. And yet—what heart, what goodness, what love this terrible novel of contradictions shows.
973009727	There are very few books that can last the test of time as well as Frankenstein. It love the deep psychology in such a powerful way. It makes you feel for the monster in a way you never thought you would. I’ve read and reread this many times and enjoy it every time.

94920461	This is one of the classics I had never read before. Many might have read this in school even or discussed it at university. First and foremost it is important to note that there are two versions of this book, both penned by the author: the original of 1818 and her later revision of 1831. The differences might explain some fundamental differences in perceiving this classic.The differences are as follows:1) the 1831 text is structured differently: after Letters 1-4 the chapters are numbered through from 1 to 24; this, to a large extent, obscures the original division into three volumes and also affects the reader's awareness of how Walton, Frankenstein and the monster's narratives are bracketed one within another;2) the epigraph from Milton's Paradise Lost that appeared on the title page of the first edition has been removed:Did I request thee, Maker, from my clayTo mould me man? Did I solicit theeFrom darkness to promote me?—the absence of these lines (which some modern editors of the 1831 edition restored) removes the announcement of a key theme of the novel, as seen from the point of view of Frankenstein's creation;3) Mary Shelley removed many of the references to new scientific ideas, thus detaching the novel from its original intellectual context and the issues that were being debated both publicly and in the Byron-Shelley circle;4) Frankenstein's character is very differently conceived: whereas in the 1818 version there are many points at which he could exercise free will and choose not to carry on with his experiments, he is seen as being, like all human beings, entirely at the mercy of fate in the 1831 text, helpless to counteract the forces of chance that appear to control the universe. My version is the original of 1818 and the first thing that struck me (even without considering the author's young age when she wrote this) was the beauty of the prose. The writing style is a bit alien to modern readers perhaps but it is accurate for the time the story was written in and utterly beautiful. No matter if Shelley had her characters describe nature scenes or human emotions, every line was quite poetic without being rigid; the language was fluid.The story is, as some might not know because of inaccurate modern interpretations in other media forms, that of the young Swiss natural philosopher (what could be called a scientist nowadays) Victor Frankenstein and how he put together a being and gave it life through a scientific process. However, upon seeing the creature he created, he is horrified and flees because the creature is quite ugly. The creature leaves as well after a while and has to travel the world alone in search of companionship which does not go well - even more than nowadays, the society back then judged mostly by ones outward form so the creature is doomed to always be seen as wicked, gets hunted and beaten until the violence changes him. Remarkable is that he teaches himself speech and reading. He is very eloquent in the end which is a stark and tragic contrast to his deeds.The focus of this review, however, is how I loved the narration of the story while utterly loathing the protagonist, Victor. He was such a whiney, pretentious windbag! Honestly, I was so glad when the narration switched to the creature's story because I could not have endured one more minute of his lamentations. I was appalled by this "man", who caused so much misery only to point the finger at another. He failed to even only admit to himself that he was the cause of events. I can cut him some slack regarding the first shock, but especially after all the self-reflection he should have shown himself to be as noble as he and others constantly pretended he was by DEEDS! Mistakes can be made but then you need to own up to them and change your ways or you lose all right to complain. Words are nothing but hot air yet it seems to be the only thing Victor Frankenstein was capable of. Me me me me me. That's the only thing you hear from him. Even when (view spoiler)[Justine is sentenced to death although she is innocent, and Victor even calls her poor, (hide spoiler)] he immediately turns the situation around to pity himself once more and to describe himself as the center of misfortune at length. After months and months of tragic incidents he still cannot see what he's done and that it is his own doing that brought said misfortunes on everybody - in fact he only sees his own misfortune (how he is robbed of a family member or friend). He is lucky beyond belief (like (view spoiler)[how he easily got out of the murder charges (forget the fever) when compared to Justine (hide spoiler)]), comes from a well-off family (just consider the amount of money he has no problem of gathering and then spending in the end), has an excellent reputation which was very important back then (and means he is not treated as his creature was) - yet constantly whines, laments and complains how woeful his existance is. At several points in time he could have turned things around; he was given chances, but his insistance on being a victim is his downfall and he can't even acknowledge that.Just as bad is Walton's perception of how nobel Frankenstein is and how wretched the creature - by pointing out exactly what incriminates Frankenstein and should absolve the creature of most of the guilt (not of all because (view spoiler)[committing murder, even when being treated so horribly, is still a choice and the wrong one (hide spoiler)])! It is therefore paramount to me that the author ends the novel with the creature defending himself and his actions.The narrator of my audio edition (I have both, this Word Cloud Classics edition in print and the audible file) was actor Dan Stevens (known to some, perhaps, from Downton Abbey) and he was really great in giving Walton, Frankenstein and the creature different voices. Sometimes he slipped when switching back and forth, but he always caught himself quickly and I liked his voice in this case. I pity him though because as woeful as he narrated (while befitting the story), he must have been in dire need of some anti-depressants afterwards. *lol*Another focus of my review is the author herself. I've read quite a lot about her since starting the novel (and knew some cornerstones of her biography even before that) and just like with this novel I am about two minds when it comes to her.On one hand, I see an incredibly talented girl - for she was only 19 when she wrote this book - and the not very happy life she had to endure. On the other hand, I just want to strangle her post-mortem! Continuously!Honestly, she is just as bad as Victor and I can make a valid argument that much of Victor might even be auto-biographical. She had a feminist mother who oppressed her (funny how feminists seem to always propagate freedom and self-determination but then deny just that to other people), fled into a (to me) not very loving relationship with a guy who fancied himself the world's greatest poet (he wasn't bad but certainly not the world's greatest) and slept around like a whore. She gave him reason to leave his pregnant wife (in my mind he would have done so nevertheless but she at least sped things up), fled with him and lived a life amongst a circle of so-called friends who all advocated free love. Now, I'm far from being a prude but at several points in Mary's biography (conveyed through letters she wrote and such), I had the strong impression that she was not all that much in favour of free love - she was in love with her later husband and did everything she could to "keep" him. Unfortunately, that meant travelling a lot, always running away from people her lover owed money to, accepting his "free love" (meaning that he would frequently sleep around with other people) and even pretening being into the same thing, philosophizing about honour and other "deep" topics while at the same time being a human being I would not want to be friends with. She was in no way the only one of course - one member of this illustruous circle was Lord Byron and how he treated his lovers and the children that sprang from his numerous affairs was despicable. However, that does not acquit her. She had 4 children of which only one survived and in two cases it is all but proven that a real home would have saved their lives (sturdy 4 walls, sufficient heating etc, all of which she could have afforded with her family had she not chosen an adulterer who married her only much later and only for practical reasons). She was always depressed after losing a child (which I do not dispute) but she never changed her habits, she never seems to have spent much time with her supposedly oh so beloved children in general. Instead, she liked to constantly talk amongst her friends (even after having seen that their "friendship" was as pretentious as their talks). Thus, Victor being such a pretentious windbag is the perfect representation of Mary and her friends. Words but never deeds. As Victor and anyone of us, Mary made mistakes; that's OK and no reason to condemn her. However, she lamented this or that misfortune although it was usually self-inflicted by sheer (repeated) stupidity and she never even only TRIED to change her situation. Even if her novel was her way of addressing her guilt, her own situation, she never took responsibility any more than her main character! Thus, as with Victor Frankenstein, I can have no pity and she cannot redeem herself in my eyes. Harsh, as my opinion was called in another thread, but it is my opinion nevertheless.Therefore, it is noteworthy that I find the protagonist and the author pretentious but never the novel! As I said, the language and prose is fluid, eloquent, beautiful - but never stilted. This is why this novel gets such a high rating from me.
7816168141	“I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel” me giving frankenstein five stars in 2025? i truly did not see that coming, but for sure a new favorite classic of mine. and the more i learn about mary shelley, her life, and the circumstances around this book and the rewritten version, the more i love it even more. this was actually a lot different than what growing up with so many media interpretations had lead me to believe. But this story is told in letters / journal entries from a self taught sailor to his sister, while he is voyaging to the north pole and finds a man in the freezing temperatures. this man is none other than victor frankenstein himself, who is now allowing this sailor to write down the tragedy of his life which involves him creating a man.this story really makes you think about who really is monstrous, what things other people do to create monsters, and how sometimes becoming what people view as a monster is inevitable because of the sad world we live in. this tale really is all about being othered, and i simply can’t believe the things inside this story from 1818, and how they are still so heartbreakingly executed in 2025.mary shelley every volume: let me also touch on colonization and its evils real quick trigger + content warnings: loss of a loved one, child death, grief, talk of colorism, talk of colonization, talk of slavery, lots of talk of death, anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, abandonment, religious manipulation, shitty law enforcement blog | instagram | youtube | wishlist | spotify | substack♡ buddy read with maëlys
7988310026	RATING BREAKDOWNCharacters: 5⭐️Setting: 5⭐️Plot: 5⭐️Themes: 5⭐️Emotional Impact: 4⭐️Personal Enjoyment: 5⭐️Total Rounded Average: 5⭐️Reading Frankenstein was like finding the original source code for so many things that I love today. It's romantic prose, gothic themes, a science fiction plot, and moral complexity are foundational to all my favorite stories. Frankenstein is a brilliant young scientist, raised in the Romantic era. As such, he is taken by the combined compulsion of ambition and idealism, and ultimately creates a being...out of corpses. It is as gripping a plot today as it must have been when it was first conceived. As I read, I kept reminding myself that this story was written by hand by an 18-year-old girl. My gratitude, respect, and awe for Mary Shelley are enormous.Thematically, you could analyze and discuss Frankenstein for years, as many have. What I love most is that it gives no answers. Nothing is explicitly concluded. It all must be deduced and pondered by the reader: romanticism vs. enlightenment, ambition vs. contentment, masculine vs. feminine, the god complex, classism, vanity, otherness, agency and accountability, bias, grief, purpose, absolution, guilt. I could go on. It's all in here. The more I ponder it, the more I find. It's no wonder there are so many derivative works and adaptations in other media. It's a playground for creatives who want to explore these concepts.Because much occurs off-page, the emotional impact of disgust, or pity, or horror doesn't hit as dramatically, but with time and imagination, it goes to the deepest places humans can. As for the characters, the epistemological writing style gives great insights into Victor, Waltman, and the creature, and you sympathize with each.Frankenstein is a rare piece of art, a stunning achievement for its time, and worthy of its classic status today. Its lasting power and impact on multiple genres and characters in an array of media forms is a testament to its complicated, nuanced, and true depiction of the spectrum of morality and the longings of the human heart.
5206868884	Here comes the part where I heroically reveal my own ignorance – yes, I have spent all my life thinking Frankenstein was the dude with the square head, pale face, grim smile, and a bolted neck. Now I have learned he was in fact, Victor Frankenstein, the genius who made this monster out of scavenged body parts.Now I have that reveal out of the way (I also have a rash I would like to discuss in another review) – let’s get on with it.Dr Victor Frankenstein comes across a party of explorers in the Arctic. This happens while a haggard Frankenstein is in pursuit of a hideous being, on the ice of this unforgiving land. Dr Frankenstein then describes to this man, his story leading up to this point.This genius created a beast from body parts. He was a man fascinated with science, and was really obsessed with life, and its essence. The being he created was in fact hideous – as you can imagine being created from scraps of dead bodies found here and there, and was eventually rejected by Dr Frankenstein. The monster – rejected – found solace in a place where he could observe a family. He learned about history, and language and became a cultured, albeit an isolated, lanky fellow. The time came whereby he wanted to love. He approached a member of the family he was observing, and was humiliatingly spurned – he then realised he was an outcast, a freak and would never be admitted to human society. He then found his creator and demanded if he could make a female for him to partner. Frankenstein acquiesced to this request – but as he was adding the finishing touches to the hideous female daemon (ette), he destroyed her. The incredibly miffed male monster then enacted revenge on the family and loved ones of Victor Frankenstein. Things start spinning out of control for all concerned, which leads to a fascinating conclusion. Lots of themes here – creation, love, acceptance, rejection, all in a story that is intriguing and suspenseful. This was nothing like I expected it to be. In fact, I am blown away by the fact the author, Mary Shelley, was only eighteen when she wrote this in the early nineteenth century. Wow. This is a sad story.The writing is exquisite. 4 StarsI can’t wait for the new Guillermo del Toro directed Frankenstein which will be shown on Netflix in early November. This brilliant director, of fantasy horror such as Pan’s Labyrinth (2006), was born in Guadalajara. The city I now reside in. In fact, there will be some pre-screenings in this, his home city, this coming Thursday 23rd October 2025. Senor del Toro is the bloke in the middle

1592300608	A recent review triggered my own distant memory of this iconic classic.Frankenstein contributed to the leaning tower of novels presented to me as a sixteen-year-old English lit student.Sadly, bolts protruding from necks are in short supply, and it is impossible to feel anything but sympathy for the 'monster' who is born to a life of abandonment, loneliness and anguish.It's astonishing to think that Shelley was so young when she created this, an iconic classic deserving of our most fulsome praise.That said, I found the book unendingly melancholic and a tad one-paced.
40533935	"Pray tell me your story," I said, "if it will not weary you overmuch."He fixed me with an eye still firm of purpose. "I had long been fascinated by the dark arts of Parody and Homage," he began. "I studied the works of the masters. Juvenal, Swift, Beerbohm, Douglas Adams... I curse the day when I discovered the Grimoire of John Sladek mouldering in an old bookshop. It was then my plan began to take shape..."He broke off, racked by a fit of coughing. "Sir, you should rest," I said. He snorted contemptuously and continued."I dreamed of creating the ultimate reviewer," he said. "It would be as prolific and popular as karen, as enthusiastic as Stephen, with the stylistic brilliance of David K and the wit and passion of BirdBrian. I enumerated its multiple perfections to myself until I truly believed them. By means I will not recount, I gathered its various pieces to me. One night, when all was ready, I laboriously sewed them together and let the fire of the Internet course through them. I knew triumph! The creature was alive."His shoulders slumped in dejection. "How I had deceived myself! I soon realised that I had created a monster, an abomination that spewed forth an endless diatribe against the Federal Reserve in speech devoid of capital letters and punctuated by foul words and LOLcats. All shunned it; even the most indefatigable of self-published authors refused its friend requests. The creature became bitter and cruel. It began to post provocative comments on Harry Potter threads, which were invariably deleted within minutes of appearing. One day, I woke to find that it had fled. After many months of fruitless search, I ran it to ground, lurking in the polls area of the Haters Club. Now I must use my last strength to destroy the thing I have brought into this world."He grasped my hand with both of his. "Learn from my fate," he whispered. "Abjure Pastiche and Post-Modernism. Resist the lure of the mash-up. Write plain, Christian reviews, that explain simply and honestly the main characters, the plot and the style. All else is temptations of the Devil."He opened the door and left, and I saw him no more.
994820808	One of those books you think you know because of its presence in pop culture etc., but you really don't... until you read it. A new favorite of mine for sure!
1772576888	“Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.” The origin of this novel is almost as famous as the book itself. A group of friends seek to outdo one another with their ghost stories. Mary, the youngest and least famous of the group, writes not a ghost story but a brief novel that has far outlived the works of every other member of the party, and that is often cited as the first science fiction novel. I recently attended a lecture on Frankenstein, in which the lecturer pointed out that there was no real science present in the novel as Mary had not been well educated in the subject, and so cannot really be considered science fiction. While I admit that she has a very valid point, I still believe that Frankenstein is indeed science fiction because the plot could not have existed without some nebulous and unexplained scientific discoveries, and helped propel this speculative genre into the popularity it still enjoys today. Even though Shelley was poorly educated in the sciences, she created something that continues to entrance and repel members of the scientific community hundreds of years after she first penned her only famous work of literature. “Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.” And all of this came from the mind of a girl not yet out of her teenage years. I know that some people think the novel was poorly written, but I have to disagree. I think that Shelley wrote beautifully, with the type of heart and dramatic flair that we all have but most of us lose as we enter our third decade. While I wouldn’t consider this a gothic novel in premise and plot, it definitely felt gothic in its emotional, overwrought tone. But that’s one of the things that makes it feel so special, in my opinion. We still connect with the raw emotion with which Shelley packed Victor’s tale of woe. (There will be vague spoilers in this review from this point forward. You’ve been warned.) “How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!” The story begins with a frame, much like Scheherazade over the course of her thousand and one nights, or like the grandfather reading The Princess Bride to his sick grandson. We are being told Victor’s story over the course of letters written by Captain Walton, who is on an expedition to find a route through the Arctic, to his sister. His crew found Victor near death from cold and exhaustion. As he recovers a bit of strength, he begins telling Walton his horrible tale. Two things I really appreciate about this framework. First of all, I’m a big fan of epistolary novels, as it gives us a self-aware, nearly omniscient first person perspective from someone who has already lived through the events being told. Secondly, and more specific, I love the additional framework provided by references to Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner. As the eponymous mariner relates his tale of woe as a warning to others, so does Victor relate his own story to Walton. It makes for a really interesting frame before the true story even begins. It also ensures that we understand we are getting the story from Victor’s perspective, allowing us to brace ourselves of unreliable, skewed narration. “Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!” Is there any figure in literature more tragic than Frankenstein’s Creature? Yes, I know that Victor himself was tragic. He was a “good man” whose arrogance led him to create his own downfall. The works of his own hands led to the senseless deaths of everyone he held dear. Shelley rightly subtitled her work “The Modern Prometheus.” Prometheus deigned to gift unto man knowledge that the gods believed should belong to the gods alone, and was sentenced to a miserable eternity. Victor gained knowledge that belonged to God and God alone, and he applied that knowledge heedless of the dangers. And he could not even blame God for what happened next, because God hadn’t created his nemesis; he himself had. “The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.” There are also some interesting comparisons to be made between both Victor and the Creature in regards to a work oft mentioned in the novel. Paradise Lost comes up time and time again over the course of Frankenstein. I believe that both Victor and the Creature at times mirror the two driving forces of Paradise Lost, Adam and Lucifer. Victor not only mirrors Adam when he gives into temptation and grasps one of the few things God has withheld from us, the power over life and death, he mirrors Lucifer when he perverts and corrupts God’s creation. The Creature is Adam in that he is the first of his kind, and Lucifer in that he seeks to subvert his creator at every turn. But unlike Lucifer, the Creature was spurned by his creator from the onset for things outside of the poor being’s control, thus almost justifying the lengths he goes to in order to inflict pain on the one who formed him. “I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel…” Victor is to be pitied, though I do believe that he brought his misery on himself. But his nameless Creature is the story’s main recipient of my sympathy. (Notice I call him Creature, not Monster? I’m of the firm believe that, if anyone is a monster in this story, it’s Victor and not his poor, hapless creation.) His creator abandoned him in horror the moment he drew his first breath. He was left alone, unloved, uneducated, defenseless. Left to his own devices, he stumbled alone from the laboratory that served as his nursery, hungry and confused and afraid. Every human that saw him feared him and sought his death. He was never shown an ounce of kindness. The Creature witnessed love in the family who occupied the cabin in the woods, and yearned to be the recipient of such love. He did the family every small kindness within his power, hoping for acceptance. But the instant he made himself known, he was cast out once more. While I dearly hope that I would not have the same response, Shelley’s commentary on society’s reactions to anything different from itself is spot on. “There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied int he one, I will indulge the other.” By the time he met his creator once more, the Creature had blood on his hands. He had committed two heinous crimes, one to cover the other. He was deserving of Victor’s hatred by this point. But I believe that he was also deserving of Victor’s help. We’ve all sinned gravely against our creator, but He is faithful to forgive. Victor was not. There was no love in his heart for his creation. Yet, even if he couldn’t love the Creature he crafted, he could have made for him a Mate. The request was fair. But his fear led him to irreparably damage what little faith was left within his Creature, leading to the further murders of Victor’s loved ones. “I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.” Everyone is responsible for their own actions. The murders committed at the hands of the Creature cannot be blamed on his creator. But the Creature’s terrifying appearance was the fault of Victor. Had he been made differently, love might not have been so far out of his reach, and murder might not have entered his heart. Both man and Creature were wrong. Both man and Creature are to be pitied. “When falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?” Not only do I truly feel for the Creature, far more than I do for his creator, I respect him. With no support from anyone, he finds a way to learn. From the Delacey family he watches, he learns language. From that knowledge he becomes one of the most eloquent beings in any classical work I’ve read. I despise the Creature he is so often portrayed as a bumbling, stupid, barely verbal monster in film. I believe that the best representation of the Creature I’ve ever seen was Rory Kinnear’s interpretation of him in the Showtime series Penny Dreadful. He might be frightful to look upon and capable of great atrocities, but man is he eloquent. “Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.” Frankenstein is a wonderful book that I highly recommend. What inspired it? Was it just a lark, a chance for Shelley to finally feel that she could hold her own in a society that overwhelmed her? Was it commentary on her views of God as casually cruel if He even existed at all? Was it a subconscious cry of anguish over her own relation to the Creature of her making, her desperate desire to be enough for her self-absorbed father and untrustworthy husband? Whichever of those motives is closest to the truth, Shelley’s novel made me think and it made me feel, and I’m very glad to have read it. Frankenstein was a tragic tale beautifully told, and one I will continue rereading.
101823079	A great read! highly recommended!Stephen King in his Danse Macabre novel mentions this as one of three essential horror classics, he says they are ' The Vampire (Dracula), the Werewolf (Jekyl and Hyde) and the thing with no name (Frankenstein).'The book is so much better than what the movie has tried to communicate. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who is a brilliant scientist with an obsession tries to play God, by creating a living human being all by himself. But all does not go to plan when the creation turns out to be not quite what he wanted. Frankenstein is terrified and rejects his creation, here's where the Gothic tale becomes a true literary work of art. What follows is the tragedy of a creature created by the arrogance and ambition of one man, an ugly yet fully human being. The monster is not good nor bad he's just plain human. What he needs is affection, love and understanding. His ugliness and clumsiness presents a problem as none is willing to approach him, he scares the hell out of everybody. First, he is sad, then, he is enraged. Here's where the real monster is created by the hatred and frivolity of other humans.A true Gothic masterpiece, this novel is unforgettable for its message, its depth, and especially for its environment and mood. It is all dark, all cold, all terrifying and all moving. The true monsters are the others, not Frankenstein's creature. His wanderings around the world is a wonderful work of horror literature. Don't miss this great book written in one night by Mary Wollstonecraft, the young wife of poet Percy Shelley. Also @ webpage hereAn Image of the Author.
4072398509	i'm not saying that Frankenstein has only himself to blame ... but yeah actually he had it coming and he's only got himself to blame 😐he gave his poor monster anxiety and abandonment issues, what did he think would happen ? 🙄
4303016853	Wowwwww.I’m truly blown away. Can’t believe how much I loved this.
4228395472	damn dude maybe i too am a giant creature made up of dead people's remains constantly seeking genuine human connection and acceptance

1795509154	"Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful."Frankenstein is the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who attempts to reanimate a dead body. Hollywood… you have lied to me all these years *shakes fist* Frankenstein is the complete opposite of what I expected! First of all, Frankenstein himself is a major tool. Second of all, the monster is not some dim-witted fool without a brain. He is actually more well-spoken than yours truly.My overwhelming reaction to Frankenstein is how the hell did Mary Shelley write this at just 18 years old?! The writing is so beautifully atmospheric, and it's such a complex multi-layered novel. What I really find fascinating is that this isn't set in any of the usual gothic settings, like a crumbling castle for example, a lot of it takes place in the great outdoors, which really brings something different to the narrative. Frankenstein is also considered to be the first science fiction novel combined with supernatural terror, which is mighty impressive when coming from an 18 year old girl raised in that time. My perception of Frankenstein was that it was about a scientist who uses electricity to bring life to this corpse made up of a conglomeration of body parts, which then goes on to mindlessly kill or hurt people. Bearing in mind, I've never actually seen a Frankenstein adaptation. Oh, and even though I KNOW that Frankenstein is not the monster, that link is still in my head for those first few seconds when I initially think of Frankenstein. So to read Frankenstein and learn that all my assumptions about this book were pretty much wrong was a real eye-opening experience! It's not just a story about a monster, it's so much more than that. It really makes you reflect on the ethical and moral repercussions of experiments like this. Is there such a thing as going too far in the quest for knowledge? As a scientist I can completely understand the obsession that can come from blue-sky research. There is also of course the famous story behind the creation of Frankenstein - Lord Byron and a group of guests spent an evening together on Lake Geneva in 1816 reading ghost stories, which then led to the challenge for each person to write their own ghost story in a writing competition. The edition that I read gives even more insight into Shelley's personal life at the time, and I was really surprised at all the heartache and strife she had gone through - and would go through after completing Frankenstein as well. I now have a strong desire to read more about the story behind the book, given how inspiring Shelley's backstory is.I never had Frankenstein down as one of those books that would get me all emotional and teared-up! But my heart was breaking during the monster's recollection of events. Why couldn't that family just take him in and accept him?! *cries* Although I must admit if a 7 foot tall yellow creature appeared at my door, I'm not so sure I'd welcome him in with open arms either… but I'd like to think I would?! Wishful thinking, perhaps! The loneliness this character goes through… the abandonment. Truly one of the most heartbreaking stories in fiction. And all because of that damned Dr Frankenstein! What an absolute toolbag. You can't give life to something and then just wipe your hands clean - well, you can, but you SHOULDN'T. I'm team monster all the way, even during those cruel moments when he really tested my compassion for him… but still, I prevailed team monster.At the beginning I was a fan of Victor, I admired his determination and dedication, the man is clearly a genius. However, once the monster is created he begins to lose his humanity and becomes so whiney, self-obsessed and annoying. Soz, mate, but you brought it all upon yourself. If you had have taken some responsibility for your actions, things wouldn't have gone so tits-up.I think I've gone on long enough in this review… I didn't think I would have so much to say about Frankenstein, but I guess this just shows how much I really loved this one! Definitely earned a spot in my top classics list. 4.5 stars.
7077580316	Una obra maestra Sé que por la simpatía de un ser vivo, haría las paces con todos. Tengo en mí un amor como apenas puedes imaginar y una rabia como no creerías. Si no puedo satisfacer a uno, complaceré al otro. ¿Cómo es posible que la historia que conocemos de “Frankenstein” sea tan diferente a la original? Es casi una blasfemia como ha sido modificada con el tiempo. Jamás volveré a ver cualquier película o serie relacionada de la misma manera porque ninguna le hace honor a la idea original. Mary Shelley ha realizado un trabajo increíble. ¡Qué sorpresa tan agradable me he llevado!Este libro me ha gustado mucho porque esta es una historia que promueve la empatía, a pesar del odio y la venganza que sienten los protagonistas. El monstruo , como lo llama en repetidas ocasiones su creador, Víctor Frankenstein, es un personaje acomplejado que sufre mucho por su soledad y por las emociones que siente que no logra comprender. El monstruo se siente rechazado, abandonado, presenta serios problemas de identidad y en el fondo solo desea lo que cualquier ser humano podría desear: Ser feliz. Sin embargo, es un ser que influenciado por su sed de venganza es capaz de cometer cualquier crimen. En el fondo, no es tan malo como parece, pero sus acciones demuestran lo contrario.Por otra parte, Víctor Frankenstein también sufre muchísimo internamente debido al arrepentimiento que siente por haber elegido jugar a ser Dios, dándole vida a una criatura que no debería tenerla. Es un peso que agobia su alma, una sombra que lo persigue, una mancha que no puede ser borrada de su historia. Y claro, es natural su impulso de rechazar a La criatura… su criatura , porque no quiere identificarse con ella, no quiere que haga parte de su vida. Por eso sufre tanto. ¿Entonces, a quien darle la razón? ¿Al humano que tras equivocarse desea volver a tener una vida normal, pero negando la responsabilidad de su creación? ¿A la abominación que sufre emocionalmente pero que se comporta violentamente para torturar a su creador? Sinceramente, es muy difícil estar completamente a favor de uno de los dos. Ambos tienen la razón, pero también se equivocan. Ambos merecen ser felices, pero también deben responder por sus errores. Ambos se necesitan para sanar internamente, pero ninguno soporta la presencia del otro. Una relación muy conflictiva que nos enseña que la venganza y el odio nunca son una buena guía para hallar la felicidad. Si alguno de los dos hubiera tenido un poquito de empatía, la historia sería diferente.El estilo de la obra en forma de diario me ha encantado y la prosa de la autora fue súper fácil de leer, a pesar de ser un libro de hace más de doscientos años. Cada detalle del argumento está bien explicado, los diálogos presentan fluidez y en términos generales, estoy muy satisfecho por la estructura y narración que se presenta en la obra. A pesar de que esta fue la primera novela que Mary Shelley publicó, se nota en su pluma la experiencia y cercanía que tuvo con los libros desde su infancia. Su talento es realmente impresionante.He decidido calificar esta obra con cinco estrellas porque me ha entretenido el argumento, la resolución de la trama me ha dejado satisfecho y porque filosóficamente, es muy interesante la lucha interna de Victor Frankenstein contra sus dilemas morales. Es un libro creado especialmente para hacer reflexionar al lector sobre los peligros de la ciencia, la ambición de subyugar a la vida y la muerte, el poder y la ética de nuestras acciones. Una joya que sinceramente vale la pena leer y releer, y que jamás pasará de moda. Muy recomendado para cualquier lector, no perderán el tiempo. Se los garantizo.
1399830878	Everyone has probably either watched one of the multiple adaptions of Mary Shelley's novel or at least heard about the monster created by Victor Frankenstein, but if you haven't read the book itself, then you probably don't know the story at all. The premise itself is rather simple; a young scientist called Victor Frankenstein creates a murderous creature from stolen body parts and has to deal with the harrowing results as the monster unleashes terror and revenge upon its creator. This sounds like a combination of horror and science fiction, which this novel essentially is, but ultimately, human emotions are the profound factor and the very heart of the book which keep the story flowing.Among the thousands of Goodreads reviews for this book, you will find enough hate for Frankenstein to keep you busy for a while if you really want to read all those one-star-reviews, but if I can give you some advice ... read this book instead. It isn't nearly as long as some of those huge intimidating classics by Dickens, Dumas, Hugo and the like, it is gorgeously written (although a lot of people may disagree here), and you will find more tension in this classic which was written almost 200 years ago than in some thrillers from our time. "Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.""Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock." Going into the experience of reading this book, I wouldn't have expected to find such a richness of vibrant characters, completely different settings ranging from a university in Ingolstadt, Germany up to the extents of the North Pole, and, most importantly, such beautiful writing. The masterful style Shelley applied while writing this book kept me hooked to the story and made me turn pages even if the story sometimes may have stretched out (which it didn't, at least for most of the time). And let's not forget that she wrote the novel at the age of eighteen. Readers seem to criticize her lack of compassion and comprehension for the nature of men, but in the end, every person is different, and what matters is that among the scope of this story, all the characters were believable and worked for me.And when I say all the characters, then I include the monster Frankenstein created. In fact, this hideous creature, murderous and full of revenge and bitterness, is one of the best-developed villains ever created in literature (and my favorite character from this novel). Judging from looks and appearance, the creature is a monster, the personification of evil, but looking behind the shell, what appears is a lonely human being longing for affection and, ultimately, love. Isn't that what humanity is, at its very essence, about? The reasons for the creature's deeds were so believable and well-explained that I couldn't help but feel sorry for his experiences and hope for a happier life (even though I knew the ending and that it is anything but happy). In the end, physical appearance has nothing to do with the humanity of the character behind those looks. It's not physical beauty which makes you human, it's the beauty of the soul.Which leads us to Victor Frankenstein, the creator of the monster, the man who played god with science and corpses and then decided not to accept the responsibility he loaded upon himself. You cannot breathe life into a being only to abandon it, disrespect its struggles to enter this world and then later complain about the being's quest for revenge motivated by the way Victor fathered him without teaching him how to live. Appearing innocent and unable to overcome the step between childhood and adolescence, Frankenstein himself should be called a monster, as it is nothing but a monstrous deed to create life and expect the knowledge of how to live will arise from nothing.I know how many people hated this book, but I don't feel ashamed at all for considering it to be one of the finest pieces ever written and counting it as one of my all-time favorites. To everyone who hasn't read this classic yet, I can recommend experiencing its beauty on your own - and going into it as excited for the story as you would with a mystery novel written in the present days, not expecting to find a boring and dragging classic (which it definitely isn't).
