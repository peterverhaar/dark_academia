3665940976	**UPDATE: WOAH WHAT!? This is not only getting a film adaptation but it is going to be STOP MOTION I AM SO EXCITED!**Winner of the 2021 Women's Prize for Fiction.‘I was in a house with many rooms. The sea sweeps through the house. Sometimes it swept over me, but always I was saved.’An infinite labyrinth with an ocean inside, academic murder mysteries, many-worlds theories--Piranesi by Susanna Clarke has it all. This tightly written novel is endlessly engaging and so cinematic it feels more like something I have watched than read, which is blissful as I cannot stop thinking of the endless halls of The House with it’s many statues, changing weather patterns, ocean tides and of course, our friend Piranesi surviving it all. It’s a mixture of the show Lost meets the 90s computer game Myst with a touch of Jorge Luis Borges and some pompous English academics thrown in for good measure. Sure, it’s mostly plot for the sake of plot but it is infinitely fun and mind bending in ways that scratch all the right itches. A delightful meditation on belief and pursuit of knowledge combined with a boldly mysterious investigation into how and why the narrator exists in this surreal world, Piranesi is a sharp and witty adventure you should certainly lose yourself in.‘The beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.’The story opens to the narrator describing his life in the House. It is an endless labyrinth of ‘Classical architecture stitched together’. These massive halls are filled with an eccentric assortment of statues are full of windows that look out upon the stars and the basement level of halls is flooded though with the tides the water occasionally washes up. The narrator is not alone, there are birds, fish he can catch and eat, and thirteen skeletons who he visits in a near-religious ceremony of food offerings and kind words. There is also The Other, an older man who roams the halls in search of a great power. The two men meet twice a week to discuss what they have discovered, though The Other may not be exactly all he seems, nor the narrator either. The narrator cannot remember life before the House, but keeps a detailed journal of his time there and concludes he must be in his mid thirties and have lived there for several years. The Other has named him Piranesi, after Giovanni Piranesi, an Italian Classical archaeologist, architect, and artist known for drawings of fantastical labyrinths and prisons. Piranesi has come to know the House by memory and catalogues all he knows about it. He loves the House and feels it, too, loves him. The World feels Complete and Whole, and I, its Child, fit into it seamlessly,’ he writes. He looks upon the statues for guidance and in them finds messages of hope and strength. The House gives him food, gives him weather, gives him purpose even if it is only to serve as the inhabitant of the House. He has adapted to its rhythms, even creating his own calendar around the events of the house--the novel takes place in ‘The Year the Albatross Came to the South-Western Halls’. This is a novel where not much can be said of the plot without spoiling the really delicious mysteries and the carefully plotted ways they are unveiled. I will do my best to speak obscurely of anything plot related.Piranesi feels himself compelled to his work by a duty to science and understanding, though this differs from the ways The Other (and, as we learn, many others who seek the House) seeks knowledge about the House. Piranesi believes ‘the House is valuable because it is the House. It is enough in and of Itself. It is not the means to an end.’ He exists for its glory and for him that is enough. For The Other, however--and Lawrence Arne-Sayle--seek knowledge as a means to an end, for power and the glory it brings. While they claim to be ‘doing it for humanity,’ there is an aspect of ‘the ends justify the means’ which they will openly admit. There are many crimes obscured by the mystery of the quest for the House, which distort its glory to Piranesi.‘I realised that the search for the Knowledge has encouraged us to think of the House as if it were a sort of riddle to be unravelled, a text to be interpreted, and that if ever we discover the Knowledge, then it will be as if the Value has been wrested from the House and all that remains will be mere scenery.’Much of Piranesi borders on religious belief, though more of a spiritual belief in a natural world than anything. There are many pagan ideas infused into the novel, such as when Piranesi goes to one hall to see what constellations can be seen only to discover the statues appear to be arranged to stare at the moon which is perfectly centered in the hallway window. The date, as noted in his journal, is the ‘twentieth day of the sixth month’: the summer solstice. What Piranesi has found in his comfortable communion with the House is, it would seem, not unlike the great power some have sought after. There is talk of the ‘old ways’ when humans could speak to nature and nature would speak back and bend to the wishes of humans. It is believed ‘nothing simply vanishes’ and it can be found again. But Piranesi, in his love for the House, already believes it communicates with him. He thanks it for the food it brings, for the shelter it provides, for all its wonders and beauty and kindness. ‘The Tides themselves are full of movement and power so that, while they may not exactly be alive, neither are they not-alive,’ he writes, and that ‘we were drenched, we were numbed, we were blinded, we were deafened; but always we were saved.’ His ways of speaking about the House as if it were a Deity resemble the sort of secrets the Other wishes to obtain but, in all his searching, cannot find it. Because he seeks it and does not simply live it, it cannot be seen. This becomes similar to protecting the environment and the way nature speaks to us when we strive for it. By having ravaged the land for the sake of wealth and power, we have nearly killed it and each other but if we listen to the world and live sustainably we can all thrive.This becomes a novel about transgressive ideas, though not in the way that many originally thought them to be (repeatedly pointing out that Lawrence was gay solely to demonstrate all the ways he was ‘transgressive in nature’ is pretty uncool of the author though). While thinking outside the norm makes one an outcast, what we discover is that what they were thinking wasn’t odd but the way they would go about using that knowledge and the means to obtain it. The halls are either a curio to be exploited, or something to cherish, and the meaning of them is different for every character. This book gets really sinister, and the way it creeps up on you is almost akin to horror aesthetics.Piranesi is a wild, twisted and surreal ride that is unfolds so well by constantly teasing insight and toying with tension that it’s nearly impossible to put down. The opening section could easily have been extended with 100 pages of him simply exploring the halls and I would have loved it, so my only real criticism here is that it was a bit too plot heavy when it could have breathed more. But I so enjoyed living in the images in my head--the atmosphere of this novel is fantastic and will bring you to such stunning places. This is a really fun and fascinating look at the pursuit of knowledge and how sometimes it goes too far and for the wrong reasons. A really worthwhile weekend read, you will definitely want to get lost in the halls of the House.4/5‘May your Paths be safe, your Floors unbroken and may the House fill your eyes with Beauty.’
3428008857	A second fantasy novel from the author of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell — finally!! It's excellent, and VERY different from Jonathan Strange (for one thing, it's less than 250 pages). Review first posted on Fantasy Literature (along with my co-reviewer Bill's excellent review, which I reference a couple of times below): I have to say I was a smidgen disappointed to get to the end of Piranesi and not have seen a single footnote (I’m quite fond of all of the quasi-scholarly, tongue-in-cheek footnotes in Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell). But that was my only disappointment with this transcendent novel. An etching by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, 18th century Italian artistPiranesi, who narrates this story through his journal entries, is the sole living inhabitant of a labyrinthine, half-ruined building he calls the House. He also calls it the World, which in a very real sense it is for him: he has no memory of living anywhere except in the House, which is an endless series of halls and vestibules, with no entrances or exits, where ocean waves and floods beset the lower levels but also provide him with life-preserving food, tools, and fuel. It’s reminiscent of Jorge Luis Borges’ The Library of Babel, except with awe-inspiring statues in every room rather than (near)infinite books, as well as Borges’ “The House of Asterion.” Piranesi has found a baker’s dozen of human skeletons in the House, which he religiously cares for, but the only other living person he has seen there is the man he calls the Other, who visits with him briefly twice a week and irritably quizzes him on his explorations of the House.To paraphrase Winston Churchill, Piranesi — the character as well as the book itself — is a riddle (who is he?), wrapped in a mystery (why is he in the House, and what does the Other have to do with it?), inside an enigma (what is the House?). I felt compelled to pencil notes in the margins of my brand-new hardcover copy of Piranesi (“Minotaurs!”) and mark key passages. Note-taking did have the benefit of slowing me down and making me think more deeply about the layered mysteries, the symbols and allusions and ironies. Piranesi’s and (when it’s revealed) the Other’s names, like Clarke’s suggestive epigraphs at the beginning of the novel, are clues that readers may or may not want to pursue before getting deeper into the book. (I would absolutely love to be a student in Bill’s class on Piranesi!)For as Bill comments, there’s a delight in simply inhabiting the House with Piranesi. It’s a beautifully described world, and Piranesi is a wonderful companion, brimful with good-hearted innocence, trust, and a joyous sense of wonder. His harmony with nature and his selflessness are inspiring, as when he gives up a large chunk of his precious store of dried seaweed (which is both food and fuel to him) so that a pair of albatrosses can build a nest.It approximated to three days’ fuel. This was no insignificant amount and I knew that I might be colder because I had given it away. But what is a few days of feeling cold compared to a new albatross in the World?To get too caught up in the details and the whys and hows of the ever-present, looming mysteries is to risk diluting the ability to immerse yourself in Piranesi’s hauntingly beautiful life and world. When the answers begin to be disclosed, it’s fascinating but at the same time a dose of the mundane, bringing the ineffable, at least partially, down to earth. The latter part of the book shifts tone to more of a suspense novel, with some heart-pounding moments of tension and danger. But then, there’s a marvelous ending that brings us full circle, back to that initial sense of wonder and awe.In my mind are all the tides, their seasons, their ebbs and their flows. In my mind are all the halls, the endless procession of them, the intricate pathways. … The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.It’s a testament to the power of Clarke’s storytelling that those lines almost brought me to tears. Piranesi is an extraordinary and thoughtful novel with radiant writing, illuminating our own lives.
4457118051	Umm, is that it?Ok, let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this book. Obviously, I'm an outlier and my thoughts here are decidedly in the minority. So if you feel differently, please don't throw rotten vegetables at me. Going into Piranesi, I had heard nothing but great things about it. How it's riveting and unputdownable. How no one had ever seen a story like this before. How the twist is going to blow my mind. Unfortunately, none of those turned out to be true for me.For one thing—and please forgive for saying this—I just don't find endless descriptions of halls, statues, vestibules, tides, fish, and birds to be that interesting. I know, I can't believe I just admitted such a thing publicly. But that is the majority of this book! It was tolerable for the first thirty pages, when I worked hard to read and reread each description slowly so that I may keep straight every hall, statue, vestibule, tide, fish, and bird encountered. But I soon grew tired and just proceeded to read without retaining.And it wouldn't be a big deal if the only issue with this book is its excessive descriptions. After all, I've read plenty of books like that and still eked out some enjoyment. But here, the descriptions are in combination with writing I couldn't make heads or tails of. I'll be honest, I barely understood most of the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters, no matter how much I concentrated or how many times I reread it.So what's the problem? Well, for me, I just don't see a point to reading like that. When the writing is such that it isn't meant to be understood or remembered, but rather just skimmed to reach the end, then why am I even reading it? Sure, I wiled away some time turning the pages, but I ultimately come away unchanged, and for me, that is the worst result a story can achieve.For such a short book, this sure was a slog. Lots of readers report reading it in one sitting because they couldn't put it down. It took me three days of dedicated reading time to get through it. Every time I put it down, I had no urge to pick it back up. The only reason I kept going is the promise of that great twist.And here, my expectations were wrong too. For me, a twist means that the story is leading the reader in one direction, but then a development happens that takes the story in a completely different, unforeseen direction. Thus, the reader is surprised. But that didn't happen here. This book clearly leads you in one direction, and the reveal is exactly what you would expect from it.Perhaps if you didn't know the book's genre going in (not sure how you'd be able to swing that though), this development would come as a surprise. But it's a fairly common concept. So to prevent the reader from figuring things out early, the book is written such that it maximumly obscures everything. Keeping the reader in this haze-like, confused state for as long as possible is the goal of this story.And when we do reach the end, no actual explanation of the logistics are given. The how's and why's are just handwaved away. I don't mind being taken for a ride, but the destination had better be worth it. And it wasn't here. I expected creative and original, but I only ended up with derivative and unsatisfying.I know not every book is for every reader, and this one definitely isn't for me. I marvel at stories that take complex and intricate ideas and turn them into something easily understood. This is the opposite. It takes a fairly simple concept that's been done many times before and somehow manages to turn it into the most obscure and confounding tale. No, thank you.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧
4758077630	The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite. aka The Mind of Ellias is broken; his Soul fucking fullfilled!!!!!!!!!!!! The way I cannot begin to express or even put into mere words on how this book made me feel....literally immeasureable and inconsolable!!!!It honestly felt like a missing part of a dream, sequenced away to savor and find for later. This missing piece? A callback to that wonderful and comforting nostalgia- our childhood's wildest untamed dreams and imagination, back to when anything was possible. Dear reader, this was a fucking feast of unfettered joy and a brimming capsule of a callback to our childhood selves in its purest and most undulated form. The best of the best. Maybe perhaps, we still can do all the things we imagined ourselves to be and want to do. All because of this said book? Hell fucking yeah.A new brilliant favorite.

3581449921	Well, I guess it is time to say that Susanna Clarke's slender little PIRANESI is my favorite novel of possibly the last five years. I could write spoilery essays upon essays about its use of metaphor for ambition, identity, religion. I'm so delighted.If my novella "Opal" drove you batty, it might also drive you batty for similar reasons, but personally, it gave me everything I wanted.I don't want to say too much more because the beauty of this puzzle box is in the opening, but highly recommended (with an exhortation to persist through the confusion of the first 10 pages or so).
4562661025	Delightful. An antidote to the trend of self-serious writing that there's so much of recently. It's a fun and easy read that's compelling, but gets to a depth many less entertaining books wish they could arrive at. Anything involving impossible architecture has me hooked. This was a gift from a friend, and I think I'd recommend it too.

4227650031	A genre-blending, memorable, and melancholic standalone novel.This will be a short review. Writing the review for Piranesi by Susanna Clarke is not an easy task. It has taken me five days to write this review, and you might notice that it’s a relatively short review. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a short novel; I’m sure you can finish reading this book within 3-4 hours. Second, it’s due to spoiler reasons; before I started reading Piranesi, I received plenty of advice saying that it’s better to read this book without knowing anything about it. Don’t check any reviews, just dive into it, and I have to agree with this advice. So I’ll keep this review as brief, effective, and spoiler-free as I can. “Perhaps even people you like and admire immensely can make you see the World in ways you would rather not.” If you want to know what the story is about, the official blurb did a great job of telling the premise without spoiling anything. And yes, the book is indeed as bizarre as the premise sounds. But this is what made Piranesi difficult for me to review, and it’s also one of the main charms of the book. A huge part of my enjoyment and admiration with Piranesi is attained through every step of navigating the World with Piranesi. The sense of discovery is key, and it must not be tainted. Readers are plunged into Piranesi’s house with infinite rooms, endless corridors, and I won’t lie, the first quarter can be a challenge to read. I had zero ideas what’s going on in the first 50 pages, and in a different situation or reading mood, there’s a good chance I would’ve put it on the DNF pile. But based on what I’ve heard from other readers doing the read-along with me, this is normal and to be expected. Discovering all the mystery together with Piranesi was a delight, and Clarke’s prose—despite the confusing parts, for me—was engaging throughout the whole book. “The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.” I loved Piranesi. The first quarter was hard to get into, but everything after that was wave after wave of revelations and thrill. For such a short book, Piranesi packed a lot of food for thoughts. It’s different from many books I usually read, and it’s a novel that will stick with me. Piranesi has won and been nominated for many awards, and it’s well-deserved. That’s all I can say in this review. Believe me, if you’re interested in this book already, skip reading any review—mine included—and just read the book. Explore everything with Piranesi.

3944390870	I would like to be in charge.Yes, I hate to make decisions, and yes, I like things that no one else likes and dislike things everyone adores, but at this point I think I should take one for team (but mostly me) and start dictating.Because this book did not go where I wanted it to go, and I'm so intensely upset about it that I've decided that will be my villain origin story.I thought this was going to be very magical and lovely. In fact I thought this was going to be magical realism with a one of a kind and unforgettable setting, which is my very favorite thing for any book to be. (In addition to short, which this is.)It seemed like a Recipe For Success.Instead, I was doled out a heaping serving of Suffering.This book is mostly about how real life is a bummer. And if I needed a reminder of that, I could just, like, go outside. Or choose to be an active participant in my own life for once.Like I would ever voluntarily do either of those things. Active participants don't read 200 books a year.Bottom line: My quest for world domination just got sped up.-----------------pre-reviewso it turns out i want magical fantasy ONLY.review to come / 3ish stars-----------------tbr review"Piranesi's house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others.

3742520834	this story reminded me of ‘house of leaves,’ in the most oddly beautiful way. the beginning is tediously meticulous, just as the MC is, and i wasnt sure i was enjoying it. but over time, the strange, mythical, and quite sad nature of the story really starts to come through. i was actually quite stunned by how attached to piranesi i got and how melancholic the ending made me. im not sure what else i can say except this was a pleasant surprise. ↠ 4 stars

3501571302	Is it possible not to suffer from claustrophobia when you’re reading a story make you feel trapped in a palace consists of endless labyrinth of halls and vestibules? Nope, you cannot. This book is a complex, challenging puzzle you need to solve and it takes so much mental, intellectual energy to get involved into story. The author’s storytelling technique is unique and after waiting for eternity to read her second work, she can honestly surprise us with different genre choices and dazzling writing style. It seems like it’s the interpretation of Myth and Labyrinth but trust me it was so much more of that. ( more mind bending, dazzling, twisty) We just keep witnessing strange encounters throughout our reading journey including elephant carries a castle, squatting gorilla, a faun keeps smiling, chess lover kings: all of them symbolize something with deeper meaning. Piranesi is the main character of the story who lives a life in a watery, murky labyrinth without questioning his own past or present, choosing the ignorance as a bliss. Being trapped in a dungeon or a prison with endless halls never makes him push to find a way to get out. He thinks he’s living by himself, all alone till some signs show otherwise.It was truly so much different from Jonathan Strange’s story. There is nothing in common with both books. So if you dream to read something similar from the author’s previous work, you may be disappointed. This book is intense, needing so much effort and patience to enjoy the symbolic literature taste and in my opinion even though you may see some resemblances with the myth, it’s not a retelling. Its genre is also indecisive, mythology, mystery, absurd dark comedy and partly retelling genres are blended into was his other. It is smart, it exhaust you, burn your brain cells but thankfully it’s not long, boring or repetitive. It’s experimental, fantastic, intelligent but also quirky. If you like to try different, original tastes of literature feast from the pen of talented author, this book may check your all boxes. But I have to tell this novel is literally not everyone’s cup of tea.
4318842417	Hmmm.I read this quite swiftly. It's a short book, but even so, I read it in only a few lumps in about a week. Which is fast for me. So, in that sense it's a page turner. In another sense it didn't particularly grab me... allow me to explain - it was the central mystery, and the fact that it is a short book, that propelled me through. I wanted to know what was going on, and then when I did know what was going on, I wanted to know how it would end.It was not a book where I developed affection for the characters, or was wowed by the twisting of the plot, or was thrilled by the action. It wasn't even a book where I was particularly transported by the prose. The setting felt rather like a one trick-pony, and I grew a little weary of statues after a while. I shouldn't complain about that too much, having a few months ago finished a book set in a possibly infinite library, I find myself open to the same charge of readers growing weary of shelves and books....I've not read any reviews yet, but I saw from the average rating and number of ratings that the book is highly rated and very successful. It feels a little peevish to complain about a book that kept me turning the pages and centred on an intriguing idea. But I must admit to coming away from it wanting not more of the book but more from the book.It is for much of its length a gently, quirky book, that has some undeniable measure of beauty to it. And I guess I'm out of step on this one in finding it a bit repetitious, a bit long winded despite its brevity, and a bit thin despite the depth of its final line.Certainly a long way from a bad book. Just not quite my cup of tea. Join my Patreon Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes...
3823508326	Che intreccio magnificamente architettato. è rinfrancante sapere che c'è ancora qualche autore interessato a usare i marchingegni della scrittura per qualcosa di più stimolante che creare metafore ardite e autoreferenziali quindi inutili (e spesso brutte). Un piano ingegnoso quello della Clarke, che rivela anche uno studio del mondo classico, della mitologia e della filosofia. Eppure l'ambientazione non è la canonica costruzione dei setting fantasy. Ci dobbiamo immaginare non tanto il progetto dettagliato di un edificio quanto più la planimetria di un labirinto: l'intenzione è quella di evocare un mondo lontano, nascosto ma familiare. In altre parole: lo devi sognare, non abitare. È sicuramente più un mistery che un fantasy, d'altronde. Esiste un mondo fantastico? Sì. Ma è più un enigma filosofico che un mondo da esplorare. Peccato per il finale un po' sbrindellato.
3283255247	If at all possible, this is the kind of book you should go into knowing as little as possible about it. It can be confusing and even disorienting at first, but it's a book that is very smart about how it is going to teach you what it is, so I recommend letting the book do that rather than any reviews or jacket copy. So here's my totally non-info-about-the-book review to hopefully give you an idea of whether it will be a good one for you.First: do not approach this book expecting it to be anything like JONATHAN STRANGE. Like many people, I adore that book, and this is not like it in any way shape or form. The only way in which they are similar is that they share a kind of glee in not following the rules so that you do not know what to expect. PIRANESI is not difficult to read but it is strange. It requires a bit of dedication. It is not long, though, so it isn't the kind of commitment that you will have to spend days or weeks reading it bit by bit. While it doesn't have a real momentum to it in the prose itself, I was compelled to continue and read it quite quickly because I just wanted to know what the hell was happening. Nothing is quite what you expect here. It is unclear whether the book takes place in a universe resembling our own and what relationship it is meant to have to our world for most of the time you are reading it. It is not a book with a lot of plot or character development either. It is, when it comes down to it, quite simply a mystery. Except that the mystery is the entire concept of the book, where it's set, and who the characters are. Mysteries that exist in a kind of fantastical world are not all that common, though, and it's best for both sets of readers to relax a bit because, remember, this book is not going to follow the conventions of either genre.My experience of the book was quite delightful, even if, at the end of the day, it ends up being much more of a trifle than JSAMN. They are in many ways opposites, this one so small, a weird little bonbon of a book that is over just as it's begun, while the other is so large and complex, the kind of massive intricate dessert you do not want to eat because it looks so nice. But there are pleasures to be had in an unusual little escape, pleasures to be had in being baffled, and Clarke is more than competent to see you through this small exercise as she is a massive tome. It is, in its way, a perfectly peculiar beach read.Update: reread on audio, which was quite a lovely experience. Reread holds up well since I had only the vaguest memories.
3391942666	This Review ✍️ Blog 📖 Twitter 🐦 Instagram 📷DNF @25%I am not an expert when it comes to the author’s work. I haven’t read Susanna’s well acclaimed Jonathan Strange & Mr.Norell novel. I was excited when I saw this book because it has such a good synopsis, it sounded whimsical and the cover gave me Greek God vibes which are my favorite. Unfortunately I DNFed it. I have checked the current ratings and I am only the third person who gave it a 1 star so this is an unpopular opinion for sure. I know many readers will enjoy it but this review is mostly for the few people who won’t.The major problem with this book is that I read 25% before I decided to stop and I barely understood 25% of what I read. The writing did not feel natural to me, I was confused most of the time and although it is a short book, it was hard to go through. I could have continued for a couple of hours and finished it but I felt that there was no point in doing that.The writing is very “purple”, I felt that the author tried too hard with the descriptions and she could have used much simpler terminology to describe things. The thing is that it felt like reading a calculus book with all those numbers (The fiRst Day oF The FiFtH MonTh of the YeAr thaT the Albatross came to the South WeSt shore and so on…).I can’t say I related to Piranesi because I was so confused. The other characters were not given names but were given nicknames or symbols which did not help at all in my opinion. I can’t talk much about the plot because I did not finish it.Summary: I wish I enjoyed this as much as I wanted but I simply did not. I believe this is an unpopular opinion and that many readers will enjoy it (Already many readers did) but simply the writing was not for me and I was confused for the majority of the small part that I read. Farewell Piranesi!You can get more books from Book Depository

3620964727	I'm not the most patient reader, so diving into this one took a bit of perseverance. But once I got lost in its surreal world, it was worth it. Recommend this for people who don't mind meandering, enigmatic and whimsical, and being okay with not knowing what is going on.Don't spoil the fun by overloading on reviews beforehand; half the joy is peeling back the layers of this atmospheric tale yourself.
4294429831	Piranesi is a very clever piece of writing, and it is also a very difficult book to review. Why?Because I can’t really talk about the content of the book. Anything I say (and I mean literally anything) would spoil the story. I can’t talk about the characters, the plot or even some of the central themes. If you’ve already read the book, then you will understand perfectly why. If you haven’t read the book, then I urge you to stop reading this review (and those of others.) The best way to approach this one is with little to no knowledge about it.I can say one thing though: keep reading it. The first part is a little perplexing. It’s unusual and even a little repetitive but, once again, please keep reading because it opens into something truly fantastic. I would expect nothing different from Susanna Clarke. __________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________
3709805877	What a remarkable book. There is something so rhythmic about the writing style, repeating, cycling, like waves lapping against the shore, or tides rising and falling as they are wont to do. Piranesi lives in a house with many halls, a labyrinth of statues. He is alone, except for The Other. He is of the house. And the house is always kind. He knows these halls. He knows the ocean’s whims. He is fastidious in his note keeping, filling journal after journal. He knows so much, and yet he doesn’t know his true name. Or how he came to be in this place. Or who he was before the house was the world. This novel will take you places you never expected, twisting and turning in search of the mythical Minotaur, or perhaps it is the Minotaur who is searching for you. I will undoubtedly be reading this one again. Trigger/Content Warnings: death, kidnapping, isolationYou can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | Twitter| TikTok

3184672193	Piranesi is fantasy in its purest form. It’s a dreamlike tale stemming from the mind of a visionary author, an author so familiar with genre tropes that she manipulates and subverts them with incredible ease. If you, like me, have wondered why everyone seems to be at a loss for words when it comes to describing the plot of this book, be aware that you’ll probably have the same reaction after reading it: there is simply no easy way to pitch it, no quick blurb to draw readers in.It starts off as a weird, albeit intriguing, retelling of the myth of Daedalus's labyrinth, only to expand into dark academia/paranormal thriller territory as the mystery behind Piranesi’s existence slowly unveils. Still, Clarke steers clear of genre conventions, crafting a story whose unique plot and clever twists are unpredictable yet immensely satisfying to the reader.Much like many of my favorite fantasy books (Harrow the Ninth being the first that comes to mind), Piranesi requires the reader to blindly trust its author and follow an unreliable narrator down a path that will eventually lead to a compelling conclusion. The journey is, however, just as fascinating as the destination. Clarke’s style and narrative voice are reminiscent of 19th century English literature, adding to the otherworldly and timeless atmosphere that permeates the book. The prose is simple yet elegant, like that of a modern Jane Austen.Above all, though, what makes this novel worth reading is the way it handles its themes. At its core, this is a story about the search for knowledge and the meaning of knowledge itself: something whose immense power can only ever be fully grasped by those who do not seek to dominate it.
3699510096	2021 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B. When I picked up this book, my immediate thought was, I’m going to hate this. 😬 I’m not the type to enjoy overly fiction-esc worlds, with very little explanation, that requires a lot of imagination to picture on your own. 🤓 The first 1/3 of this book was rough for me. I almost threw in the towel. I’m actually glad I stuck with it. This book is a trip. I’m still not 100% sure what was really going on. But, I think that’s the point. 🤔 I found myself thinking about this book when not reading it, trying to figure it out- and well, any book that can do that is worth finishing. 👍
4353990330	Llevaba muchos años esperando la nueva novela de Susanna Clarke, sabía que me iba a encantar, iba con las expectativas altísimas... y sí, ha logrado sorprenderme y enamorarme de igual manera.Piranesi es una obra sutil y engañosa que tiene su fuerte en la belleza de su narración, en esas imágenes tan vívidas que logra instalar en tu cabeza la autora, en la concepción de la fantasía como algo atípico y reflexivo. He disfrutado de cada palabra de Piranesi, y aunque traté de alargar la novela por lo que la estaba disfrutando, al final me ha atrapado y he terminando devorándola en un par de días. Y como en contadas ocasiones me ha ocurrido, al leer la última página he vuelto a la primera y he comenzado a leer de nuevo.Que belleza de historia.
3539570872	The Paradox Book of Paradoxes.Q:The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite. (c) Q:‘Do the Statues exist because they embody the Ideas and Knowledge that flowed out of the other World into this one?’ (c)Q:… may your Paths be safe … your Floors unbroken and may the House fill your eyes with Beauty.’ (c)The opening is the weakest I've ever seen anywhere. At the beginning I was flabbergasted at how bad the setting is. Just imagine: in the middle of nowhere sits an endless hotel house. Since it's so very endless, it has windows and is partially flooded and partially cloudy. And, yes, there are windows, so, it's no endless in all directions, just in some of them. Maybe. Then there is a lot of fun gibberish about Statues and places (no, Places) where they are located: Halls, Houses, Vestibules, Doorways, Staircases, Passageways, Plinths, Niches, Apses and all kinds of other Buildings and parts thereof, intact or not. The architectural nightmare where the MCs exist is immense and unending, but, BUT there are Windows and Cortyards and Sky and Clouds which should mean that there must be at least some endings somewhere… Sounds like a nightmare? There's more:There are rooms in this house. What a shocker! They go prenumbered, like this:Q: … I have travelled as far as the Nine-Hundred-and-Sixtieth Hall to the West, the Eight-Hundred-and-Ninetieth Hall to the North and the Seven-Hundred-and-Sixty-Eighth Hall to the South. (c) 2 alive guys traipse around this House. A bunch of dead guys (in the form of skeletons) are lying around. The MC is called Piranesi (like this guy, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovann...). Was it allusion to his Carceri? It's not his name, obviously, but that's what he's called by 'the Other' (Val Ketterley). The Other is someone Piranesi has weekly meetings with (I'm getting the nice and comfy corporate feeling from this). Yeah, and all the capitalisation made me feel by this point like it was written in German. I do realise why his had to be done in precisely this way but it's quite irritating. So, the guy, Piranesi, is stalking the house. He does that for years. Years are distinguished like this: - 'the Year I discovered the Coral Halls', - 'the Year I named the Constellations', - 'the Year I counted and named the Dead', - 'the Year that the Ceilings in the Twentieth and Twenty-First North-Eastern Halls collapsed', - 'the Year I travelled to the Nine-Hundred-and-Sixtieth Western Hall',Everything's happening in 'the Year the Albatross came to the South-Western Halls'.The world setting out is a total mindfuck. Then some magic starts happening: the worlds achieves some weirdo dynamic, reveals start happening. That's what I thought, preparing at this point for another horrible read. Deliria diary basically. Yes, it is a bit (lot!) like Borges and a bit like Wilde but it's not anything of theirs since they generally did not prefer to stay away from all meaning for the sake of pretty picture (or text, as is the case with Piranesi). But these pretty pictures after some point started revealing something incredible. I'm pretty sure that this novel has bright future and will be either popular or widely known. Why? Not because it's good. But because it's quirky and it's very much a standalone, unlike other recently published stuff. And yeah, since people will love to twist it this way and that and try and find some extremely well-hidden meaning in between all the Statues. The Statue of Angel on smth will be interpreted as an allusion to maybe Thomas Aquinas, the Water will be made to sound as maybe Time or Knowledge or Life or Energy or smth equally fitting (a lot of things could be made to fit such blank imagery), the Sky will maybe become some interpretation of Limits in something (Learning, Understanding, Possibilities, Life, etc… ), the House - some crucible of smth equally meaningful… Well, who knows…. A lot of things can be understood in a lot of alternative ways. Q:I am determined to explore as much of the World as I can in my lifetime. To this end I have travelled as far as the Nine-Hundred-and-Sixtieth Hall to the West, the Eight-Hundred-and-Ninetieth Hall to the North and the Seven-Hundred-and-Sixty-Eighth Hall to the South. I have climbed up to the Upper Halls where Clouds move in slow procession and Statues appear suddenly out of the Mists. I have explored the Drowned Halls where the Dark Waters are carpeted with white water lilies. I have seen the Derelict Halls of the East where Ceilings, Floors – sometimes even Walls! – have collapsed and the dimness is split by shafts of grey Light. (c) What an exciting world they have! Q:The Other believes that there is a Great and Secret Knowledge hidden somewhere in the World that will grant us enormous powers once we have discovered it. What this Knowledge consists of he is not entirely sure, but at various times he has suggested that it might include the following:1. vanquishing Death and becoming immortal2. learning by a process of telepathy what other people are thinking3. transforming ourselves into eagles and flying through the Air4. transforming ourselves into fish and swimming through the Tides5. moving objects using only our thoughts6. snuffing out and reigniting the Sun and Stars7. dominating lesser intellects and bending them to our will (c) Q:An angel with a trumpet and a ship. An angel with a trumpet suggests a message. A joyful message? Perhaps. But an angel might also bring a stern or solemn message. Therefore the character of the message, whether good or bad, remains uncertain. The ship suggests travelling long distances. A message coming from afar.A book and clouds. A book contains Writing. Clouds hide what is there. Writing that is somehow obscure.A child and mice. The child represents the quality of Innocence. The mice are devouring the grain. Little by little it is diminished. Innocence that is worn down or eroded.So this, as far as I can tell, is what the birds told me. A message from afar. Obscure Writing. Innocence eroded.Interesting. (c) Q:it occurs to me to wonder why it is that the House gives a greater variety of objects to the Other than to me, providing him with sleeping bags, shoes, plastic bowls, cheese sandwiches, notebooks, slices of Christmas cake etc., etc., whereas me it mostly gives fish. (c) Q:The House is valuable because it is the House. It is enough in and of Itself. It is not the means to an end. (c) Q:Well, to begin with there are no lesser minds; there are only him and me and we both have keen and lively intellects. But, supposing for a moment that a lesser mind existed, why would I want to control it? (c) Q:Abandoning the search for the Knowledge would free us to pursue a new sort of science. We could follow any path that the data suggested to us. (c) Q:I mended one of my fishing nets and worked on my Catalogue of Statues. In the early evening I went to the Eighth Vestibule to fish in the Waters of the Lower Staircase. The Beams of the Declining Sun shone through the Windows of the Lower Halls, striking the Surface of the Waves and making ripples of golden Light flow across the Ceiling of the Staircase and over the Faces of the Statues. When night fell, I listened to the Songs that the Moon and Stars were singing and I sang with them. (c) Q:Two memories. Two bright minds which remember past events differently. It is an awkward situation. (c) Q:Once, men and women were able to turn themselves into eagles and fly immense distances. They communed with rivers and mountains and received wisdom from them. They felt the turning of the stars inside their own minds. (c) Q:When she was a teenager D’Agostino told a friend that she wanted to go to university to study Death, Stars and Mathematics. (с)
3612299579	It's easy to get lost in this fantasy World of hallways, vestibules, staircases and statues but luckily Piranesi is there to lead the way. Personally I really enjoyed this book. But it is very subjective. So much of the symbolism and imagery is ambiguous and different readers will interpret it in different ways - or not at all.

6903622870	In a sense, Piranesi can be seen as a speculative mystery novel. This type of novel is interesting because it explores broader issues than traditional mysteries and can intersect more deeply with sci-fi - after all, sci-fi often involves cognitive puzzles. This novel does an excellent job of merging these elements.Potential Spoilers Ahead!In the story, the mysterious protagonist, armed with a notebook and a love for an equally mysterious otherworld, constantly explores the world surrounding him. From an aesthetic viewpoint, this world is a dream for lovers of massive, silent objects - endless halls stretching in all directions, filled with various statues, clouds, rain, mist, birds, stormy seas, seaweed, fish, scattered bones, and occasional mysterious leaves. This otherworldly space, inspired by the 18th-century artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s series of prints, "Imaginary Prisons," starts as a huge enigma.Adding to the intrigue is the protagonist himself. In this empty world, his only direct interaction is with the hall. He’s in a state of deep amnesia, meaning he and the reader are equally clueless about the mysteries before them. For mystery lovers, this passive reading experience may feel unusual, and the plot twists aren't entirely unexpected. But the novel’s appeal lies not in these twists but in the reflections and cognitive shifts they provoke.There are a few occasional strangers in the hall, most frequently a man named "The Other," who names the protagonist "Piranesi" and seeks his help to find "Great Lost Knowledge" within the hall. The battle for this knowledge forms the novel’s main plot - essentially a missing persons case in an otherworld from the victim’s perspective.The missing persons case stems from a group of scientists (or natural philosophers) exploring this otherworld called "The House." To uncover the so-called lost knowledge, they commit many immoral acts, with Piranesi as one of the victims. A teacher in the group first abandoned the quest, believing the knowledge was gone, but his student persisted, leading to the novel’s events.What makes the story truly interesting is the concept of "Great Lost Knowledge." The natural philosophers believe the ancients could converse with the world, using their thoughts to influence and be influenced by it. They opened the door to the otherworld by realigning their mindset to this ancient state.The most intriguing aspect is Piranesi’s view of the otherworld compared to the natural philosophers. They see the world as either containing or lacking wisdom, but Piranesi believes the world itself is wisdom. He considers himself a child of the hall, seeing the waves bringing food, clouds delivering water, birds marking time, and silent statues as embodiments of the hall’s will. In this sense, Piranesi is closer to the ancient wisdom than the scientists.However, Piranesi is also an outsider whose old memories were erased (likely due to time and loneliness). This gives his memory quest a unique meaning, involving both recovering his old identity and forming a new one.I can’t fully articulate what this novel conveys from this angle, but it can at least be interpreted from the relationship between humans and nature. The silent hall isn’t lifeless but vibrant, lacking only the noisy civilization accumulated by human arrogance. Piranesi finds a childlike freedom here, knowing how to survive - feeling the world’s love. He sees it as his home and ultimately rejects his past identity, embracing a broader natural world over traditional society.The novel’s end hints at this view. Piranesi chooses to go to the human world - not return but go, as a hall emissary. Interestingly, he finds real people corresponding to the hall’s statues. The statues are vibrant, but their real-world counterparts are worn and dull. The hall becomes a vast art installation, symbolizing an ideal human world where statues capture their owners' best moments or soul’s essence, living in endless love.Recent reading experiences make me wonder if sci-fi increasingly focuses on human relationships under grand settings, with nature playing a minor role or becoming mere backdrops or tools. Human-nature relations evolve into human-artifice relations, with new worlds devoid of nature (like popular cyberpunk). Reintroducing nature into the aesthetic system might help rethink these narratives and our place in the world.Compared to the slogan-driven mainstream of Western sci-fi, such novels might better lead us to the future we hope for. For me, this work revives the childhood thrill of reading Michael Ende’s The Neverending Story and longing for such worlds. As the novel's end says, the hall’s beauty is endless, and its love boundless.4.8 / 5 stars
3565824501	Winner of The Women's Prize for Fiction, 2021.While reading this book I was pleasantly reminded of philosopher David Lewis's possible worlds theory, the idea that all possible versions of this world exist simultaneously, infinitely. The theory posits that each of these worlds is as concrete and real as ours, and ours is unique simply because we live in it.Piranesi, the eponymous character, lives in one such world. A world, that to readers familiar with Giovanni Battista Piranesi's work, will seem like a superimposition of his numerous labyrinthine etchings. A world that is also an infinite house - waves crash and tides rise up in the lower floors while the clouds wander around in the upper floors. This house is populated by thousands and thousands of statues, some beautiful and others strange.It is my belief that the World (or, if you will, the House, since the two are for all practical purposes identical) wishes an Inhabitant for Itself to be a witness to its Beauty and the recipient of its Mercies.Piranesi does not reside there alone. The 'Other' whom Piranesi meets twice a week, also lives in the house, and together they are working on extracting an ancient, secret knowledge that the Other believes is trapped within the house.But as the story progresses, Piranesi finds himself in a complex entanglement of questions concerning his relation to the house, the other's intentions and the origins of his world. To his great distress, he also discovers that there are gaps in his memory.The book is also a study in solitude. While wandering the house's numerous halls, talking to birds, drawing stellar maps and making tidal calculations of the waves crashing together, Piranesi is utterly alone. But, he is also content. In this marvelous book, solitude is not merely a state of mind. It is life itself. The book with its Borgesque prose that's also faintly reminiscent of Lovecraftian horror, is a perfect weekend read. I curled up with it and let the world around me transform into Piranesi's eternal halls and minotaur statues.Edit: I am so pleased that a fantasy book won The Women's Prize for Fiction! Is this... Is this the beginning of the end of literary snobbery? Or am I speaking too soon?
6809881310	This book went from mythological fever dream to dark academia nightmare to pure heartbreak. So beautiful, so pure, so sad. The atmosphere of loneliness throughout the books is so well done. I immediately want to reread this - when you know the ending and all puzzle pieces have fallen into place you just want to start again. Absolutely a new favourite (does this mean I should give Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell a second chance??)
3922746500	Piranesi is a compelling read and worthy winner of the Women’s Prize. Clarke creates a vivid world and tells an endlessly interesting story with fascinating characters and mounting tension. Piranesi is best savored for its world building and psychology rather than approached as a mystery to be solved. This was a perfect book to carry me through a rainy weekend.
3512100790	“The beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.” Ok, this was a very surreal read and had quite an impact for such a short novel. Piranesi lives in the House. A labyrinth of halls filled with statues and tides that sweep through at regular intervals. He doesn’t remember anything other than the House and he meets regularly with his friend The Other where they work together to learn The Great and Secret Knowledge. Piranesi keeps diaries of his observations, but when he notices pages missing and someone starts to leave him mysterious messages in the halls he starts to question everything he has ever known. I loved the writing, it was mystical and hypnotic. I liked Piranesi’s character and how the mystery unravelled piece by piece. I think I’d have liked it to be longer so we could have had more detail/explanation. But I did enjoy it, so 3.5 ⭐️********************I need to mull. This was a lot more bizarre than I was expecting. Leaning toward 3.5 ⭐️***********************My library has just had a load of new books come in. So excited for this!
3862545373	Flipping stunning. I cannot wait to reread this. I don’t want to leave this House. Piranesi. My love 🤍
4367476543	PELO AMOR DE DEUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
3134525521	(4.5) When I started Piranesi, I have to admit I wasn't sure about it. The opening chapter is titled 'When the Moon rose in the Third Northern Hall I went to the Ninth Vestibule'. It's written in a particular style, usually found in fantasy or harder SF, which involves a lot of random proper nouns, and I always struggle with that, not least because it immediately gives rise to questions about the logic of how things are named/referred to. (Why is Dog capitalised but bird not; why is it title case Reason and Happiness but lowercase knowledge and imagination, etc., etc.) I was worried it would be whimsical, vague fantasy, and for a while the narrative seemed to bear out that impression...... but thank god I stuck with it, because it turned out to be exactly the sort of speculative fiction I love most. The narrator lives in a vast house composed of hundreds of halls, some of which are often flooded and home to sea life. He believes this house to be the world. He also believes that just fifteen people have ever lived, of which he and another man – whom he calls the Other – are the only two remaining. The Other refers to the narrator as 'Piranesi', though he (the narrator) seems to intuit this is not his real name. Piranesi ekes out a meagre existence in the House. His clothes are rags; he subsists on mussels and dried seaweed. He keeps detailed journals cataloguing every space in the House, and occasionally he helps the Other in his search for what is termed 'the Great and Secret Knowledge'. The Other's rather modern language and use of a 'device', which sounds uncannily like a smartphone, are the first hints that something is amiss in what might otherwise appear to be a world entirely alien from our own.Beyond that, it's difficult to describe anything about what happens without spoiling the plot, and I think this book is best approached with minimal knowledge. I'll just say it becomes increasingly gripping as it goes along, and when its secrets are revealed, they are ingenious and completely captivating. (There's another good book it really reminds me of, but mentioning that would probably be a spoiler too!)You could argue that Piranesi is the polar opposite of Clarke's wonderful Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell: it's short, it has a very small cast of characters, and it takes place in a deliberately enigmatic context rather than a meticulously detailed one. At the same time, it's similar in sly, clever ways, not least through its dry humour. It made me want to read JS&MN again; it made me feel I would quite happily read a thousand-page version of this story, too.I received an advance review copy of Piranesi from the publisher through Edelweiss.TinyLetter | Linktree
3061605894	I'm lucky enough to have read this. It is wonderful, and strange, and not at all like Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell except in being brilliant. I can't really say any more than that. The title is a major visual clue, though...
3149379820	This book was a colossal disappointment. I'm giving it two stars because the writing is wonderful. It's immersive and a pleasure to read. Unfortunately, other than the writing style and the setting, I didn't enjoy anything else about it.If you want to find out why I didn't like it, I'm going to give you some information you may not want before reading it. I'll keep the first section as spoiler free as possible and go into full spoilers in the second section.(view spoiler)[Minor spoilers only: This book starts as fantasy, and very quickly you realise it's portal fantasy, that the "real world" is right out of a door, and the protagonist just doesn't know about it.Now, this is the DUMBEST protagonist I have ever encountered. Ever. In my life. It’s impossible not to know exactly what is going on from about 35% into the book, and then you have to wait until the 75% mark for the protagonist to catch up. If this was supposed to be some elaborate metaphor for something, it got lost in how frustrating it was to read. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[Actual spoilers ahead, turn back before it's too late: Ok, so we've established that the protagonist is very thick. Now let me tell you why.From very early on, it's pretty obvious that there's no way The Other lives in The House full-time, given the fact that he seems to have an extensive wardrobe. We get told about his clothes very often. The protagonist asks absolutely no questions about this, even though all he has to wear are rags because he's worn them for so long. He justifies this to himself as the House providing The Other with these things because The Other is helpless. It comes across as the protagonist being simultaneously deluded and supercilious.He also seems to be able to ask The Other for things, which he very conveniently remembers, while forgetting other perfectly common things, like what a police station is. He does, however, know what a Prince of Wales check pattern looks like. He wouldn't know who the Prince of Wales is, mind you, but the name of the pattern? That he knows. Makes sense. The protagonist spends all his time calculating the tides, exploring, finding food and taking care of the skeletons that litter the place. This is cool as far as survival stories go, but all he seems to eat are mussels and seaweed, so with the amount of exercise he gets, he would probably be dead within a month. Eating a fish once every few weeks is not going to keep you alive, but we get told about 5 million times that "It is important to keep the body hydrated and nourished." This got very tiresome.Now, let's keep in mind that the protagonist considers himself a scientist. So you'd think he would notice odd things and ask questions about them. But he doesn't. He just rationalises everything to death. This is why when you're reading this book you know exactly what's happening at 35% and he just doesn't get it. All you get after that point are further details, but you know that he got there because The Other trapped him somehow. This is so painfully obvious that I was sure something else was going to happen and another twist was coming up. It does not. That's it. He got tricked into going to the House, lost his memory after a while, and The Other has been gaslighting him for six years. That's it. There are other characters. They don't add anything to the story other than context.I have no idea why this book had another 150 pages after that because there was no more character development, we learn absolutely nothing about the House other than how to get there, and not even how to get out other than "walk that way". Which again, is absolutely ludicrous. If all the protagonist had to do to get out was stumble back through a portal and all he does every single day is explore, the likelihood that he didn't go through at some point for SIX years is vanishingly small.I get that The Other is, as far as the protagonist knows, the only other person alive who exists. I understand that the mental repercussions of isolation, memory loss and gaslighting can have very severe consequences. But while they seem to make him completely oblivious to any red flags from The Other, they also seem to have no real consequences later on when he makes it back to the real world. He just kind of... gets a split personality and goes on with his life? That would be fine by itself. I don't know what I would have done with this premise. But I spent 65% of this book reading about this guy's very slow realisation of something I already knew and I can't get past that. (hide spoiler)]
3567095771	4.25/5 ⭐If you're looking for something strangely unique, this is your sign to pick up this book as your next read!You need to know that this is actually not the easy-breezy read you'd think it might be. With that in mind, it's also indicated to read this while also not knowing absolutely nothing about it or the most basic few ideas.First things first, the cover is superb. Absolutely stunning. The sheer, simple elegance of it, the bronze details, the little fawn on the cover sitting on a pedestal, everything screams academia, intellectual environment, science, and Darwinistic aesthetic. And this is all true. There's something so complex about the simplicity of this cover, don't even tell me you didn't think this might be an interesting read by only looking at this gorgeous cover because I won't believe you. The shiniest aspect of this whole book is the world building. This world is so unique, so complex, so meticulously and vastly constructed to resemble a neverending labyrinth that at first when you get to witness it being built in front of your eyes, it gets confusing. It's slow to get into the action. You're lost. But that's the exact thing the beginning of the book wants you to be. The labyrinth is both a physical thing in the book, but also a metaphorical trap we all fall into at first. “The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.” As the story advances, we get more comfortable with this maze of half-submerged halls and doors and ecosystems. Because, yes, this world is built to resemble a house, but each room has its own ecosystem within its walls. I'm talking waterfalls and rivers and moons and rocks and caves and Pantagruelic statues. Magical, right?The action is full of mystery and the story is drenched in unreliable characters, the vibe of everything happening making you question every sentence and every little detail. You'd be stuck between marvelling at a beautiful world constructed into magical realism and also the struggle to grasp what's really happening and what's actually happening in a deceiving manner.

3382806427	In 2004, Susanna Clarke’s debut, “Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,” burst from a cloud of pixie dust. An 800-page work of historical fantasy about two magicians in 19th-century England, the novel was quickly dubbed “Harry Potter for adults” and could have vanished in the dark woods of Hogwarts knockoffs. But Clarke’s literary ancestor is not really J.K. Rowling, it’s Charles Dickens, and even readers who resisted fantasy fell under her spell. My copy of “Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell” still shimmers — I’m no longer surprised to discover it’s teleported to different parts of the house.We believers have waited a long time for a second novel from Clarke, and so it’s especially exciting to see that none of her enchantment has worn off — it’s evolved. Reading her lithe new book, “Piranesi,” feels like finding a copy of Steven Millhauser’s “Martin Dressler” in the back of C.S. Lewis’s wardrobe.The highly circumscribed action takes place in a palace filled with an infinite labyrinth of halls and vestibules. The walls of all the rooms are decorated with statues covering every available space: There’s a woman carrying a beehive, a smiling faun, a squatting gorilla, a boy playing cymbals, an elephant carrying a castle, two kings playing chess — on and on, a vast inventory of sculptures, each representing an object, concept or feeling like a whole lexicon carved in marble.The hypnotic quality of “Piranesi” stems largely from how majestically Clarke conjures up.....To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert...

3571021106	Gorgeous. From the start of this book to the finish, we are transported into a truly enormous house full of sunken rooms, many statues, fish, and birds -- a realm of nature, and an impossibly huge house.Our narrator, far from being a prime candidate for truly reliable storytelling, is nonetheless a very objective and careful natural philosopher. The descriptions of this world are beyond beautiful.Only one other, if you don't count 13 corpses, is his company during most of the novel. The Other is also a scientist of a sort, but he is more interested in the deeper pathways of magic. I'll tell you though -- this book may not have any outright magic, but we are still steeped in it. It's not merely the descriptions, but these are the core of it. I was frankly blown away from the birds hopping between the statues. The idea that we can see nature as a world that is constantly communicating with us, that we can negotiate with, made me believe that we were either in the deep past or in the realm of the Fae. And more than anything, I just wanted to know what this world was, what was going on, and what was the true mystery.Beyond this, I will not say, because it is the journey that truly counts.I still feel the magic here. Hell, I feel the magic and the magick, for make no mistake, there is plenty of both in these pages. :)This is a real treat for both natural philosophers and metaphysicians.
3563105349	Weird and unforgivably boring. Its like reading my ATM receipt in Esperanto
3715089624	Exquisitely plotted and realized. Being subverted (or plundered) here is the gothic haunted house trope. The physical structure —“the World”—may to some extent be a memory palace. Despite the surrealist underpinnings the narrative has a beautiful logic and rigor, and it unfolds almost geometrically. “It is my belief that the World (or, the House, since the two are for all practical purposes identical) wishes an Inhabitant for Itself to be a witness to its Beauty and the recipient of its Mercies.” (p. 12)The novel also reminds me, spatially at least, of Jorge Luis Borges’s infinite library story, “The Library of Babel,” though the only books we come across are the narrator’s precious notebooks. Superb.

7842849480	An easy 5 stars and a perfect way to end a very depressing reading slump. I read through this in about 4 hours. After reading the first few pages I wasn't sure whether this would be for me. The diary entries (or to be more accurate the diary dates) were so confusing and I felt like this could be hard fantasy which I've never really read before. Instead I read one of the best novels I've read in such a long time. It's almost a perfect little puzzle with small clues here and there. The denouement was perfect and genius. The ending was stunning and also heartbreaking. There is no way I could continue with the review without spoiling anything so I will end here. What I would say is read nothing about the novel beforehand as going in blind is the best way to go. Absolutely stunning novel
3617806640	Winner of the 2021 Women’s Prize. I re-read it after its deserving shortlisting for the 2021 Women's Prize (one of many prize listings including Costa and Hugo/Nebula). The second time around I read a Waterstones special edition with an additional chapter at the end of the book and I found the book equally enjoyable.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe author’s long awaited second novel after her astonishingly ambitious debut novel - one that I read in a single sitting (this follow up I should stress not the debut!)This book as has been well documented is not a follow up to “Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell” but has its origins much earlier in the author’s reading and writing life: In my twenties, I loved the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges. They’re generally very short, very precise and very jewel-like. Some of the worlds he created are strange — worlds that pose philosophical questions and make you think in ways you’ve never thought before. One world, for example, is an endless library (The Library of Babel). So at some point in the 1980s I wrote a few pages about a Borgesian sort of world which consisted of a vast house in which an ocean was imprisoned. Two characters inhabited it; one character understood the house instinctively and could navigate it easily and the other character could only really increase his understanding of the house by studying the first character Other very explicit literary influences on this novel include: - Borges’s “The House of Asterion”- CS Lewis’s “The Magician’s Nephew” (which features in the epigraph, the name of a major character) – in particular Charn and the World Between the Woods- Lewis’s “The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe” as more explicitly signalled by the front cover the edition I read and in a remark about a young child meeting a faun in a snowy landscape- The Carceri d'invenzione drawings of Giambattista Piranesi (chosen for that reason as Piranesi's nickname)- The philiosophical writings of Lewis’s fellow Inkling Owen Barfield particularly his ideas of original participation and (developed jointly with Lewis) chronological snobbery - (and very clearly) Plato’s allegory of the caveWith underlying themes including isolation (and it’s strange pleasures) and the relation of man to the natural world - so a book that is both timeless and timely in a year when COVID lockdowns and climate change concerns top the news agenda and pertinent to the author who wrote this book while suffering with chronic illness that largely lead her to being physically confined pre-COVID. My overwhelming take-away from the book was that (not unlike some of Lewis’s imagery) much of the book is a metaphor for the imagination and in particular the imagination of a reader of fiction. Certainly my own experience on reading this novel was as follows: short bafflement followed by intrigue as I setted into the world of the book; annoyance as our own world seemed to intervene on the edges of this world; disappointment at how the eventual return to the real world was somehow simultaneously disappointingly mundane but also unsatisfactorily mysterious; finally a desire to be able simply to return to the pristine world of the book and to ignore the real world.And somehow and very cleverly that also on a higher level reflects much of my own experience as a reader in general (not just for this book); and on a lower level reflects the experiences of many of those in the book (Piranesi but also Raphael and Ritter).An aspect I found frustrating was when the book turned from the world of speculation to the world of resolution as we read the narrator's old journals (and gain a greater understanding than he initially has). Again though I see this as a metaphor for the way in which fiction at its best tries to open up possibilities - whereas non-fiction at its best tries to close them down in a search for the truth.Definitely a book and a world to revisit from time to time and a book that reminded me of what drew me to reading fiction as a child and has sustained my interest for nearly a half-century.
6470158938	RATING BREAKDOWNCharacters: 3⭐️Setting: 5⭐️Plot: 5⭐️Themes: 5⭐️Emotional Impact: 4⭐️Personal Enjoyment: 5⭐️Total Rounded Average: 4.5⭐️This book is bizarre and creative and out of context in the best way. It feels like art. Its structure is brilliant, its setting original, its plot addictive, and its characters ambiguous.I love that the story explores the unending, unsatisfying, and empty pursuit of knowledge for knowledge's sake. Data isn't human. Connection is human. This plot is mysterious and gripping, and the conclusion is emotionally poignant and tender. I highly recommend this to readers across genres. This one is really special.
3883067180	The pleasures of this book are so hard to describe because it spoke to me on a level beyond language. It is, in many ways, a work of poetic attunement to the liminal — the realm of the sub-perceptual and the pre-linguistic.On the surface, Piranesi can be described as a work of fantasy. We follow a narrator who lives in a shadowy world known as the House. The House consists of a near endless labyrinth of halls, vestibules, staircases and passages — some filled with oceanic tides, others enveloped in cloud, all lined with mysterious marble statues. Apart from the narrator, only one other human — the Other — lives in the House. Both meet twice a week to discuss a project known as the search for the Great and Secret Knowledge. Without giving too much away, Clarke’s is a carefully orchestrated world full of enchantment, evocation and mystery.What sustains the enterprise are its philosophical undercurrents. The narrator lives in a state of unity with the world around him. He communes with the Dead and the birds that frequent the halls. To him, every day is filled with the promise of wonder and discovery. The Other, by contrast, sees the House as a desolate place, “full of decaying figures covered with bird shit”. These observational binaries mediate the book’s themes — mysticism versus scepticism, the subconscious versus the ego, the world of intrinsic meaning versus the realm of material gain.I read the book, also, as a tribute to childhood and all that is lost as a byproduct of “progress”. What would we look like without the burden of social conditioning, without the weight of the ego? The thinkers and references sprinkled throughout the text form important clues here (Rudolf Steiner, Owen Barfield, Plato’s Republic, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and many others).And now I come to my only critique of the book. Had this followed the conventions of literary fiction, the ending would have been less tidy and more ventilated. As it is, the narrative switches gears in a manner that unravels some of its earlier theses. Nevertheless, the House – with its endless halls, its tides, its internal weather system – will forever haunt my mind. It is, for me, a reminder of something mythic, peripheral and forgotten. As Anne Boyer writes in A Handbook of Disappointed Fate:“The world existed before books, and it always exists outside of them, and how a person should read is how a person must read, which is at least in duplicate, both always in this world and looking for another.”Mood: Enchanting Rating: 9.5/10 Also on Instagram.References• Plato: The Republic (Book VII) • Ovid: Metamorphoses (Book VIII) • Goethe: Faust• Borges: The House of Asterion • Borges: The Library of Babel• Ursula Le Guin: The Tombs of Atuan• C.

4444317756	ya know what? i don’t need all my questions answered(worth it//all comes together in the last 50 or so pages)
4325205090	My friend handed me this book and told me to go into it blind. To not even flip it over and read the back. When I finished, she told me to Google Piranesi. So that's all I will share as well. The first rule of Fight Club Piranesi is…
7853115409	This is beyond weird and as a reader of multitudinous books of macabre material if not illustrious or respectable, still I've consumed them greedily. The would be amnestic hero is called Piranesi on another unexplained world searching in a kind of castle full of rooms, with statues and roosting birds sitting on their heads. He's looking up and down enormous stairs searching for anything breathing in the limitless halls. But there is another Piranesi unoriginally names the Other, older, colder mysterious, unfriendly seemingly tolerates him yet not likes, sees once a week on Tuesday for a hour because projects are needed to complete.. why . Where the Other goes the younger man never discovers. The tides come in flooding the gigantic building , the sea brings fish, the poor, lonely man devours the seaweed cooked and feels lucky with fresh rain water in bowls and delicious fish. A life not enjoyable yet tolerable until it isn't. The unknown gives the story an eerie, creepy atmosphere are there others lurking about, what is this place , how did I get here, will it be possible to escape, do I want to. The puzzle gives the novel the spice, aroma, the smell of importance, not just a very enjoyable entertainment but much greater significance a fable which underneath the hazy surface a clarity, the meaning for any interested. However if I may reveal the ultimate truth an allegorical warning for the reader but what, only the perceptive can know. My favorite scenes are the huge tides enter the castle still both thrilling and petrifying.
4121405288	This is a highly accomplished novel with a sense of claustrophobia that pervades throughout. The story is excellent, but I just wish it were more original. Susanna Clarke wears her influences on her sleeve, especially Jorge Luis Borges. The ideas and style mirrored Borges faithfully--too faithfully, in my opinion. Still, there is a lot to love here, especially for Borges enthusiasts.
4642980069	actual rating: 4.5 stars
3092750023	5ish stars. Everyone knows picking favorite books is as unthinkable as picking favorite children. I've got one kid and a second on the way so I guess soon I'll finally figure out what that really means. Regardless, I can say unequivocally that Clarke's novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is one of my favorites. All-time top 5. It's perfect. To say I was anticipating Clarke's follow-up is like saying I think it would be "cool" to win the Powerball jackpot. 15 years later, here is this little gem. 1/3 the page count, with very little resemblance to her debut. I never could have anticipated that this is what I'd be getting. And it was absolutely worth the wait. Every page included revelations that subverted my every expectation. I realize that I haven't said much about the book itself and trust me when I say you should keep it that way before you read. Also know that, even though it's slim, it's challenging. Be prepared to wander blindly for a while and don't expect every dark corner to be illuminated even when you reach the end. Just know that I wish my time reading this book was as infinite as the labyrinth at its heart.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library
4661798780	This book was an experience - but I can’t really tell you about it, without taking that experience away from you. So go out and buy this book now, and don’t look to the end, just enjoy the journey getting there😁
5239753915	The Beauty of the House is immesurable; its Kindness infinite. Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❗This review is spoiler-free❗I can't believe how long I've been putting off this strange, unique little gem...although I am known to make some questionable choices every so often. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ I'm glad I finally read it, though. This was the most fascinating, mind-melting paranormal mystery I've ever read so far. O. M. G. 🤯🤯🤯🤯 I had no idea what was going on from much of the book but that only made me want to read it even more!! Seriously, I couldn't put it down!! I also loved that I understood everything after some clues started popping in and it made me feel so smaaart 😇😇 I very rarely read books without any romance in them, but I have been fortunate enough to pick those which don't need it at all.As far as protagonists go, Piranesi (although that's not his name 😜😜) is very well written and likeable!! He is sweet, kind, caring, and he loves birds 🥹🥹 but more often than not he is a little too nice. It was really interesting reading the story solely through his journals. This is another thing I don't usually go for, narration through journals. Most of the time I find it dull and hard to follow. Fortunately, this was not the case with this book. There was something compelling about reading Piranesi's journals, with his methodical, intelligent way of writing and cataloguing his thoughts and infinite knowledge, even though there are some fundamental gaps in his memory evident right from the start. Even though most 1st person narrations are often unreliable, and in this case, I had every reason to doubt him because he doesn't even remember his own name or how old he is and doesn't seem to be too aware of that, I still couldn't help but trust him.As for the rest of the characters, those few that are present, they are all fascinating in their own way. The most notable ones, the Other, the Prophet, 16, and the Dead, (awesome nicknames btw) all impact the story (and Piranesi's life) in such a remarkable, confounding manner that left me reeling. I wouldn't mind reading books with much more detailed backstories, even the bad guys.Admittedly, this book is strange enough that it might give some a bad impression, but I would still highly recommend it.

4994666448	Bizarre, fantastic, beautiful. Just a thoroughly wonderful read.
4210482349	I now have a YouTube channel that I run with my brother, called 'The Brothers Gwynne'. Check it out - The Brothers Gwynne “Perhaps even people you like and admire immensely can make you see the World in ways you would rather not.” So, Piranesi opposed almost everything I expected from this story, but I it is really great! Part of me was tentative throughout, and slightly puzzled what it was aiming for, but that does not necessarily need to be a negative. This is a book that I think you can get more enjoyment from when going in blind, because I was so, so engaged and interested in watching this story evolve. Because of that element of having absolutely no idea how the story is going to evolve, I will not go into too much detail regarding plot or anything that reveals what this story turns into.Piranesi is set in the real world, but with a supernatural element. Not in terms of out-and-out magic or monsters, but there is a room which is part of the world, but separate at the same time, and it operates by a different set of rules.“The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.” The story is formed through the diary entries of our central character, Piranesi, whose motivations are incredibly interesting. He grows fantastically throughout this story, with the epistolary form acting to uniquely portray the growth Piranesi goes through in such an original way. The way Piranesi views this unique setting through his introverted personality and the way this evolves and alters as the plot grows was just executed masterfully.Somehow, Susanna Clarke had me hooked and tense straight away, despite the initial events just really going through the day-to-day life of Piranesi, through his diary accounts. Such an interesting story that I believe has something for everyone, despite being an incredibly weird story. It is a thoroughly enjoyable read that explores a unique setting and had so much depth that made me want to re-read it immediately, and it is also very thought provoking. As I said, something for everyone. I think so anyway. It subverts all expectations, but still creates tension, got me engaged and offered a very satisfying conclusion. Everything I could ask for!5/5 STARS
3984776904	Holy shit. I wasn’t ready for this. You’re not ready for this. Humanity is not ready for this. Please do yourself a favor and go into this book without knowing anything. Therefore, I’m not going to summarize the book for but rather, gush all over it. Susanna Clarkes Piranesi is ethereal, philosophical and enigmatic. This is a perfect example of a book that you just have to stick with. Not going to lie, at first I had no idea what I was reading, but i’m so glad I stuck with it. It unfolds so perfectly, fitting its self like a puzzle piece. The pacing was pitch perfect and not a single passage dragged on. Clarke writes the book in a like journal entry form that is so fascinating and really makes you feel for our main character, Piranesi. The world she built had me breathless and clearly turned on my inner art historian with each passing page. From the usage of dates in a written form to the formal yet accessible writing she used, every detail and thought mattered. And boy don’t get me started by the writing, is it too early to say acclaim Susanna Clarke is one of my favorite authors of all time? Guess not, thanks to this masterpiece. Don’t care that her previous book is a thousand pages, I’m definitely going to read it and whatever she writes next!
4499599278	“The beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite”I am not even sure where to start with this book review. I only picked up this book since I had so many reviewers that I trust praise this book! Moreover, I actually thought that this was a Greek retelling since the cover gave me “Greek mythos” vibes. However, this book was nothing like what I expected. I didn’t know anything about this book going into it, which definitely enhanced my reading experience. If possible, then I would highly recommend going blindly into this story. I was absolutely mesmerised by this story. Firstly, I was quite confused about which direction Clarke was taking the story. However, I decided to stick with this book, and I am glad I did. Clarke’s prose is so BEAUTIFUL! Clarke’s ability to create intrigue, mystery and atmosphere is some of the best I have ever read. Moreover, Clarke does a phenomenal job at making you feel for the story’s main protagonist.One of the best aspects of this book is the themes. Due to spoiler reasons, I will not mention any of the themes, but WOW!Piranesi will make you think! Piranesi is definitely one of the most distinctive books I have ever read. The uniqueness of this story will not be to everyone’s taste, but I would recommend everyone give this book a try. It’s been two weeks since I finished Piranesi, and I still think about this book on a regular basis! I will need to look into some of Clarke’s other work now! 5 / 5
3891205373	Winner of the Women's Prize for Fiction 2021!I've never read Susanna Clarke's much-acclaimed debut Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, and I don't always do well with the sort of speculative novel where the reader is thrust into an undefined circumstance and spends the majority of the book waiting for the full picture to cohere. And that is... pretty much exactly what Piranesi is, so, it's a testament to this book's brilliance that I loved it despite how ill-suited it is to my personal tastes. So if, like me, you read the first page of Piranesi and groaned because it read like a bunch of gibberish, I'm going to have to implore you to stick with it for a hot second and let it work its magic. (It's short!)The thing that quickly won me over is Susanna Clarke's writing and how beautifully-rendered this imaginative setting is. I think it's best to go into Piranesi knowing as little as possible, so I won't really talk about the plot, but suffice to say it's set in a giant House which is essentially a labyrinth of halls, each lined with hundreds of statues, and in the middle of the House is an ocean. I'm usually not one to relish in descriptive writing but this setting was just so striking, so delightfully offbeat, that I was drawn in pretty effortlessly. As others have said, this book is kind of like a puzzle, but not one that you should race through the book to solve; it's the sort of reading experience that's better savored. Without saying too much, what hit me the hardest about this book is its depiction of loneliness. It's ostensibly a cerebral, ethereal, illusory book, but the longer I think about it, the more current and relevant it feels and its inclusion on the Women's Prize longlist makes perfect sense to me. I'm delighted to have read it and it's a book I know I'm going to want to return to.
5701557554	I’m on BookTube now! You can find my channel here! =)”The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; it’s Kindness infinite.”Sometimes there are books you don’t want to talk about, because going into them blind is the best thing you can do. Knowing more than necessary would ruin the experience and take away from the fun so all you can do is to stick to the blurb and be as vague as possible. Well, “Piranesi” is one of those books. I honestly tried to find out more about this story before I went into it but the entire bookish community seems to have decided not to spoil anything and looking at it in retrospective, I’m very grateful for it. So thank you to everyone who made it impossible to know more about “Piranesi” than the facts that are already written on the blurb. ”I have known for many years that the Other does not revere the House the same way I do, but it still shocks me when he talks like this. How can a man as intelligent as him say there is nothing alive in the House? The Lower Halls are full of sea creatures and vegetation, many of them very beautiful and very strange. The Tides themselves are full of movement and power so that, while they may not exactly be alive, neither are they not-alive. In the Middle Halls are birds and men…”I think I’m going to join the majority of readers here and won’t talk all too much about the plot, what I can tell you though is that I loved every second of this story and it sort of put a magical spell on me. Whenever I couldn’t read the book because I was busy doing other things, I felt an urge to pick it up again and to continue reading. I just had to know what would happen next and I was driven by this almost compulsory thirst for knowledge. I honestly don’t know how to describe this special brand of reading experience but it definitely was something new for me. The fact the entire book is written in journal entries from Piranesi’s POV added so much character to the story and the reader is right there with the MC, trying to solve a mystery neither the reader nor Prianesi were aware of when the book began. It’s quite the journey, to be honest. ”The House is valuable because it is the House. It is enough in and of itself. It is not the means to an end.”I’m kind of fighting against myself here because I don’t want to spoil anything, yet at the same time I really want to talk about this amazing book. XD Sometimes being a reader can be difficult, but for the greater good and the sake of all the readers after me, I will just suck it up and not talk about “Piranesi” all too much. I know, I know, I usually write super long reviews so this is extremely hard for me, but this time around I’ll just take one for the team, no matter how much it pains me. XDWhat I will say, is that I absolutely loved Piranesi as a character and that I adored his child-like nature and the way he saw things. It was beautiful to see this new and strange world though his eyes and to experience how much attention he gave every detail. Piranesi truly cared about the House and I think it’s safe to assume that the House cared about him too. They were a unit and they were both innocent and pure at heart, which might be the reason they worked together so well and had formed some sort of symbiosis. Their interaction was fascinating and extremely lovely to read about. I know this might sound like the house is a character as well and truth be told, for me it actually was. The House is the House and it is. If that makes any sense?! Probably only to the people who read the book.”The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; it’s Kindness infinite.”I don’t want to say more, because this is one of those rare books you have to read and experience for yourself. So I’ll do us all a favour and finish this painfully inconclusive review here, giving it my best shot to end it on a high note: Mysterious, compelling, refreshingly unique, whimsical, innocent, fascinating and remarkable. “Piranesi” was one of a kind and a story that will stay with me for a long time. If you haven’t read this book yet and enjoy magical realism with a dash of mysterious fantasy, do yourself a favour and pick it up. You won’t regret it. ;-)_______________________________This book was just… WOW!I get all the high ratings and why everyone who read it seems to love “Piranesi”. The effect of this story! It was exactly what I was craving for when I read “The Midnight Library” but never got. But with this book… damn! I got everything I wanted. I think I’m totally incoherent now. This story blew my mind so all I’ll say is:Full RTC once I calmed down enough to write one and my thoughts stopped reeling! *lol*_________________________________I’ve wanted to read "Piranesi" for ages and it’s actually a pretty short one, so I dunno why it took me so long to get to it. Fact is: I’ve to return it to the library in two weeks and I wanted to read it before it goes back. 245 pages sound doable so here I am. ;-)I can’t really explain what the book is about but apparently it’s about Piranesi who lives in a house that has an ocean in its basement and rooms that change every day. And if that wouldn’t be mysterious enough there seems to live another person in the house Piranesi never met before. Very curious about this storyline. It sounds so intriguing and unlike anything, I’ve ever read. Join my journey and come along for the ride?! =)Find me on:My BlogInstagram
4981258529	Okay so I really don’t know what to say about this book aside from that it bored me. Piranesi contains so many descriptions of halls, statues, tides, fish, and birds and I was like: what is the purpose of all of this?? I found this book to be all description and no actual substance. There wasn’t a plot or a character I could hook my attention to and thus I just skimmed to the end to finish. What I find fascinating is that so many people enjoyed Piranesi, which I suppose highlights how people really can respond differently to the exact same text. Anyway, I have books on my tbr lined up that I’m excited for so I’m hoping one of those will turn this tide of more lackluster reads.
5202672694	This is unlike anything I've read before. It's beautifully written, atmospheric and thought-provoking. I agree with everyone who says that it's best to go into this book knowing as little about it as possible. Yes, I felt lost when I started it, but I was also intrigued, and it was incredibly rewarding to watch the story slowly unfold. Piranesi is one of the most precious characters I've ever read about.
6003521692	”For a moment I had an inkling of what it might be like if instead of two people in the World there were thousands.”i mean. at its core. piranesi is basically a thriller.it’s just better written and more unique and, you know, actually good but like… it is… a thriller. (i had this revelation a few days after finishing it for the second time and it upsets me, can you tell)it’s really hard to talk about piranesi because a. you shouldn’t know anything about it going in and b. piranesi is not to be explained, it is to be experienced.actually, i take my thriller comment back. piranesi is genre defying. just like the house, the novel’s beauty is immeasurably; its kindness infinite.- - -1st time reading:Piranesi is definitely a novel you have to give a chance to find its way into the story. It really comes together in part 3 - but if you don't like it by then, you probably never will. It's also a novel you have to sit with and just blankly stare into space after finishing.that being said, this is my actual review: i have to give it 4.5 stars, i can't explainlet's wait and see whether it will give me brainrot in the weeks to come, i am very much looking forward to that*buddy read with chrysa (❀ •̀ᴗ•́ )♡*
