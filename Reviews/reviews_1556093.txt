9686402	This is M. R. James first book of ghost stories, containing eight of his best. I believe six of these eight are among the twenty best tales of ghostly terror ever written--and the other two tales are very good too. If you like traditional ghost stories that unnerve the reader subtly by suggestion and indirection, this is a book you should read.
633664986	Ghost Stories of an Antiquary is the first collection of stories by M.R. James, published in 1904, although some had been previously published in magazines. The next collection from 1922 is often nowadays combined with this volume. Montague Rhodes James was a noted medieval scholar and provost of Kings College, Cambridge. His scholarly work remains highly respected in academic circles.Interestingly one incident in M.R. James's life could have come straight from his stories. His discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at Bury St Edmunds, West Suffolk, in 1902, in which the graves of several twelfth-century abbots were rediscovered, having been lost since the Dissolution.Nowadays however, he is best remembered for his short stories, which he published as M.R. James. These are classic understated Victorian ghost stories. Many of them were written to be read aloud, as there was a tradition in Victorian families of reading spooky tales aloud on Christmas Eve. Mood and atmosphere are paramount in M.R. James's short stories. His work could be seen as a restrained English version of Edgar Allan Poe. Everything is understated; where there is horror it is rarely explicit. The terror lies in the power of suggestion and foreboding.There is often a quiet scholarly person as the main protagonist, and the settings are often rural, or a musty old library or church. This lulls the reader into a false sense of security thereby emphasising the horror of the supernatural forces which are inevitable in an M.R. James story. The situation is usually quite prosaic to start with, and the author moves very slowly piling on his tension step by step.This collection comprises: "Canon Alberic's Scrap-Book""Lost Hearts""The Mezzotint""The Ash-Tree""Number 13""Count Magnus""'Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad'""The Treasure of Abbot Thomas"The second collection entitled "More Ghost Stories" comprises:"A School Story" "The Rose Garden" "The Tractate Middoth""Casting the Runes""The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral" "Martin's Close""Mr Humphreys and his Inheritance" Edited:Some stories from Ghost Stories of an Antiquary are reviewed separately. Here are links to my reviews of these: Lost HeartsThe MezzotintThe Stalls of Barchester CathedralThe Tractate MiddothThe Treasure of Abbot ThomasHere are links to my reviews of other stories by M.R.

2751038167	Classic set of superb ghost stories. From a mysterious figure in a print, to the content of an ashtree, a mysterious room in a hotel up to Count Magnus and a whistle with a very strange quality. The author is extremely talented and crafts out a very enjoyable set of 8 stories (I liked them all). If you have a faible for antiquaries and like a carefully plotted story with a certain amount of horror at the middle you're absolutely right here. The stories are very English by the way. If you like reading Latin (don't worry, there is a translation given) it won't cause no harm. Paradigmatic ghost stories I can highly recommend. This was M.R.James' first colection of short stories and it's a great starter for his works.
396047582	This volume contains eight tasty little nuggets of supernatural horror that I found very satisfying. In each of them the story is told second or even third hand by a genial narrator whose acquaintances, who are themselves of a decidedly scholarly bent, have been the victims of supernatural intrusion into our world. Often the stories revolve around an ancient artifact able to invoke the otherworldly that is discovered by these particularly luckless individuals (though they often feel themselves lucky indeed when they first make their discoveries). The tales are all good, but my favourites were 'Canon Alberic's Scrap-book', 'Lost Hearts', 'The Mezzotint', and 'Count Magnus'. I found myself thinking of both Lovecraft (in James’ use of made-up manuscripts and a reliance on protagonists of a learned bent whose curiosity proves to be their bane) and Clark Ashton-Smith (though with prose that was a little less flowery) though I think James is a much better stylist than the former and a little less given to the more extreme flights of fancy of the latter. 'Canon Alberic's Scrap-book' – An antiquary discovers a scrap-book of ancient manuscripts compiled by the titular Canon Alberic in the 17th century that is in the keeping of the sacristan of a church in France that he is studying. One picture, “The dispute of Solomon with a demon of the night”, proves to be particularly compelling…and why is the sacristan so eager to get rid of a book so obviously of great value? Great evocation of mood and the way in which the supernatural creature manifests itself was suitably creepy.'Lost Hearts' – A rather moving tale of revenge from beyond the grave and the perils of devoting oneself to the arcane teachings of the ancients in the hopes of gaining eternal life. I knew where this one was going pretty much after the first paragraph, but I heartily enjoyed the ride.'The Mezzotint' – I really liked the interesting way in which the artifact in question here, the mezzotint of the title, manifested the supernatural and the foreboding sense of a quiet yet unstoppable horror that was the result.'The Ash-tree' – A nobleman and his descendants find that being the star witness in a witch trial probably isn’t a good idea. Good creepy/gross factor with the creatures invoked for vengeance.'Number 13' – What happens when you book a room in an inn that used to belong to a man accused of having been an alchemist and magician several generations ago? Nothing good, especially if you rent the room right next to the one in which he mysteriously died. Space and time have a funny way of bending and twisting when the undead get involved.'Count Magnus' – The titular Count reminded me a bit of Vigo the Carpathian from Ghost Busters 2: he was a mean-spirited son of a bitch who liked to torture people in his spare time and go on fun little trips with names like “the Black Pilgrimage”. Perhaps it’s wisest if you’re a travel writer getting good copy from his native village to leave the crypt where he’s entombed alone. Just sayin’.'Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad'– Ah skeptics…they always learn their lesson in the end, don’t they? Well, they do in these kind of stories anyway. If you’re kind of a priggish and pedantic professor going on a holiday to sharpen up your golf game (golf is a re-occurring motif in these stories and I don’t think James was a fan) don’t promise to do some investigating of the local Templar preceptory for a colleague, and if you do for God’s sake don’t muck around with anything you find there. If you’re lucky you’ll run into an old military type who doesn’t trust papists.'The Treasure of Abbot Thomas' – When the Abbot of a 16th century monastery basically dares you, through the enciphered clues he left behind in some striking stained glass windows, to uncover his hidden treasure don’t do it. Trust me on this.I like the way in which James gives us enough of a glimpse of the ghosts and undead horrors he unleashes in his stories to avoid Lovecraft’s almost laughable (to me at least) approach of “oh, it was so horrible I can’t even begin to describe it, just trust me it was really, really, really, mind-crushingly horrible!” and yet was sufficiently vague to leave enough of the horror to the imagination of the reader. The charming, almost homely, voice of the narrator was also a nice contrast to the ultimate invocation of otherworldly menace in the tales. All in all a really solid collection of old-school ghost stories that may not leave you cringing in terror, but you may end up looking over your shoulder from time to time. And you’ll definitely take greater care the next time that weird old manuscript seems to fortuitously land in your lap.Also posted at Shelf Inflicted
3557599343	I'm probably the only one here who wasn't too impressed by M.R. James's stories. Nothing shocked me, nothing managed to scare me at all. Besides, I was having trouble understanding the Biblical connections and citations and each time had to go look at the notes at the back of the volume I read the stories from. But I do insist that he's an excellent storyteller, never resorting to flowery descriptions in order to build the atmosphere or to induce fear. He seems to be a man of few words and because of that, we could've gotten along so well!! *sighs* Never mind. Individual ratings: • Canon Alberic's Scrapbook: 3.5 stars• Lost Hearts: 2 stars• The Mezzotint: 3 stars• The Ash-Tree: 3 stars• Number 13: 3.5 stars• Count Magnus: 2 stars• 'Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad': 2.5 stars• The Treasure of Abbot Thomas: 3.75 stars Ratings averaged to 3/5 stars
3473903413	My first encounter with the ghost stories of genre master Montague Rhodes James (1862-1936) was as a kid of about 11, reading Alfred Hitchcock Presents Stories for Late at Night (my review of that one is here: (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ), which contained “The Ash Tree.” That tale stayed with me remarkably well over the decades, and it and William Hope Hodgson's “The Whistling Room” (which appears in the same anthology) were probably the two stories that, more than any others, gave me my enduring taste for the supernatural in literature. Over the years, I'd read several more of James' works, but none of his book-length collections, though I'd long wanted to. A common read this month in one of my groups of this, the first collection he published (in 1904) gave me that opportunity.Of the eight stories in this book, I'd previously read three others besides “The Ash Tree”: “Lost Hearts,” which appears in Great Ghost Stories: 101 Terrifying Tales (my review of that book is here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ; “The Mezzotint;” and “Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad,” which is included in Charles Keeping's Classic Tales of the Macabre. (I've commented on the M. R. James stories in both of the reviews I've linked to.) Contrary to my usual practice, however, after reading the new-to-me stories here, I reread three of the previously-read ones (skipping "Lost Hearts," because I'd read it just earlier this year).James' day job was as a Univ. of Cambridge scholar of medieval and ancient literature, and he's still respected in that field. As the title of the collection puts it, he was an "antiquary" by profession, and that background characteristically flavors his stories. Old documents, which are connected to (and sometimes even a channel for!) sinister occult mysteries better left unplumbed are very often worked into the warp and woof of his plots, and spooky goings-on in the time-frame of the story are often rooted in a musty past history that's shown to be very far from dead and irrelevant. His protagonists are frequently university professors, and often antiquaries themselves. He also has a tendency to describe events that, even after the denouement, are not wholly explained --how or why something worked the way it did is still mysterious and impenetrable. A recurrent theme is the inadequacy of rationalist materialism to explain all of reality; characters comfortably cocooned in such a worldview invariably have it rudely shaken. (The author himself was a theologically conservative Anglican who was open to the possibility of the paranormal in real life. Asked, in later life, whether he believed in ghosts, he replied, "They exist, but we don't know the rules.")Malevolence on the part of his supernatural entities was something he considered essential to the ghost story (though their "malevolence" may not be universal --they may be out for vengeance on a particular person or persons, and in at least one case here we might agree that it's justified). So the stories are horrific in nature; but the horror element doesn't depend on gore and gross-out. All of the tales are in the classic tradition, with restraint in the descriptions and a greater emphasis on psychological rather than physical horror. Plots are structured in a way that builds ominous unease in the reader --though the protagonists are often oblivious-- leading with mounting suspense to a denouement.The four stories that were new to me here are: "Canon Alberic's Scrap Book;" "Number 13;" "Count Magnus;" and "The Treasure of Abbot Thomas." There weren't any of the stories that I didn't like, and it's difficult to pick a favorite. "Lost Hearts" perhaps diverges the most from James' usual style in that the antiquarian element, while present, isn't as strong as it usually is, and the story has a child protagonist. The physical manifestation of the supernatural near the end is also gorier than in some James stories, but still understated (described in one sentence) and mild by modern standards. "The Ash Tree" is set against the background of the witch hysteria of the 16th and 17th centuries (and suggests, as do some other supernatural fiction story authors like Manly Wade Wellman, that not ALL of those executed as witches were necessarily slandered innocents....) Both "Number 13" and "Count Magnus" have well-evoked Scandinavian settings --I couldn't find a specific confirmation of travels by the author in Scandinavia, but he definitely traveled in Europe a lot, and the descriptions here suggest direct personal experience. As we might infer from the title, "The Treasure of Abbot Thomas" deals with a quest for hidden treasure (but it might be better if it isn't found).E. F. Bleiler, who was in his day one of very few literary scholars to actually appreciate and specialize in supernatural fiction, contributed an excellent though short (four pages) Introduction to the 1965 Dover edition, which is the one I read. He acquainted me with a good deal of information about James that I didn't know, and really brought him to life for me as a person.
5018605156	These are kinder, gentler ghost stories from the Edwardian period. At first everything seems oh so rational—a cozy fire in the study, the gentleman scholar telling his tales to like-minded friends over a glass of sherry. Then the modestly creepy comes in to play. James’s stories come after the time of E. A. Poe with his shrieking, mad stories and are pretty contemporary with H. P. Lovecrafts’ weird and wild horror but have a style of their own. There are no shrieking ghosts or particularly violent attacks. The characters obviously are very unsettled in their proper English way and there is a slight likable humor to the stories.I liked reading them one story per evening. James is good for this time of the year when the veil between this world and the next is thin and a group of friends gathers by the warmth of the fire.
1514354927	I'd read some of these before and most are excellent. James has an imagination that can draw you in...and then take advantage of your vulnerabilities to things that may or may not go bump in the night. You will as always find reliably creepy stories from James. I can recommend this tome (or is it tomb...mwa-wah-ha-ha) if you're looking for ghost/supernatural stories.
8017772226	This was my Halloween week read plus an extra day, as I read one story each day. This was M.R. James first collection of ghost stories compiled in 1904. They were meant to be read aloud to a group. Picture a bunch of preteens around a campfire or in a setting with low lights & flickering candles. In the past few years, I have come to know that in England spooky stories are read around Christmas whereas we Americans read the spooky stuff or these days binge on horror movies in Oct in anticipation of Halloween.No blood and gore here but more mood setting to let your imagination fly with creepy or supernatural elements as each story unfolds. M.R. James himself stated: If any of them succeed in causing their readers to feel pleasantly uncomfortable when walking along a solitary road at nightfall, or sitting over a dying fire in the small hours, my purpose in writing them will have been attained. I have "liked" couple of my GR friends' excellent reviews on this collection that I cannot improve on, and I am sure when I first read them it put MR James on my radar. I thank you Bionic Jean, Peter & Werner . I thoroughly enjoyed them as well as the nice introduction by David Morrell in this Haunted Library of Horror Classic edition. In it besides lots of info on James, I learned that thrillers in the Victorian age were called "shockers".
8009875797	Quaint and cute ghost stories, mostly of academics finding haunted objects. Considering that they contain lots of Latin and libraries, and aren't frightening in the least, I would think I would have enjoyed them more. Maybe it's just the limits of audiobooks.(I did skip The Ash-Tree because I really don't care for bugs)
2515753759	Lost Hearts ★★★★★ “Master's as kind a soul as ever I see! Didn't I never tell you of the little boy as he took in out of the street?” Now that was a maliciously evil bad guy who got a heaping helping of comeuppance! Well done.Count Magnus ★★★★☆ This is the found record of the last days of a man overly curious about a long-dead evil count. It reminded me of people who obsess over Nazis, at some point the interest in more than benign... if you’re an Apt Pupil.Oh, Whistle, And I’ll Come to You, My Lad ★★★★☆ “All I know is that, if it were mine, I should chuck it straight into the sea.” Never has so much fear been brought about by linen. Is this where the classic bedsheet ghost comes from?Canon Alberic’s Scrap-Book ★★★☆☆ An old French family is eager to sell an ancient illuminated manuscript to a historian for substantially less than it's worth. He will wish he had passed up that deal.The Mezzotint ★★★☆☆ A father whose only son disappears uses his engraving talent to carve out his nightmare. Years later the piece is found to retain a ghost of that filial pain.The Ash-Tree ★★★☆☆ There is a beautiful tradition of planting a tree with a loved ones ashes. Probably best not to to try it with someone magical and evil... and vengeful.Number 13 ★★★☆☆ There’s no room number 13 at the Golden Lion hotel, not formally. But with dark history can come dark magic and somethings don’t want to stay hidden.The Treasure of Abbot Thomas ★★★☆☆ If a treasure map says it comes with a guardian why would you believe that the treasure is real but not the guardian?Average 3.5
2005199484	My (positive) review of this book has to begin with two admissions. Firstly, I have no idea how or where I came by it (hardback edition, £14.99 – quite pricey for 8 short stories) and, secondly I’m pretty certain I could not accurately have defined an ‘Antiquary’.On the latter point, Wikipedia tells me it’s the term used for a person who studies history with particular attention to ancient artefacts, archaeological and historic sites, or historic archives and manuscripts. Having read the stories, I can confirm there is perfect congruency between this definition and the title.As for the positive review – well, I thought they were well-constructed ghost stories, heavily laced with suspense. It’s fairly obvious that something gruesome is coming to get you... and sure enough it does!The tales were written around the end of the 19th Century, and tend to refer back to the 1700s. For me, this adds authenticity – somehow anything is believable if it happened before electric lighting and scientific advancement made the world a less spooky place. Ideally you’d read this book by flickering candlelight, stranded in a creaky coaching inn during a power cut, while a great thunderstorm rages through the night.The text can be quite hard going at times. It reminded me of the style of Sir Walter Scott – long words, long sentences. Indeed – judging by the ‘fog index’, a measure of the ease of readability of copy (12 is an ideal score, lower is better; this review is 11) – this book comes out at closer to a whopping 30; quite something to get one’s mincers around. But it does enhance the period effect, and the erudition of the narrator, the Antiquary.The opening story features a blighted manuscript that gets passed from one unfortunate owner to the next; I couldn’t help drawing the parallel with my baffling acquisition of this book. Just how did it get into the reading pile beside my bed? (And anyone fancy a copy?)
485780576	Most reveiewers here feel that MR James is a master of the genre and I agree. There are certain expectations of a ghost story writer and for many readers these expectations are fulfilled. As in the case of Lovecraft, the stories tend to be disarmingly similar, which is at once a weakness in terms of the religious or philosophical horizon, but has all the strength of a discipline imposed and accepted. Charcateristic of the genre is an inciteement to fear of the inheritance of the past and fear of a possible spirit world living close to us but seldom seen or apprehended. This spirit world embodies (if that is the word!) a bond with the past, our past. This is also the case with the murder mystery genre. In both the murder mystery and the ghost story, the writer works on a titilation of fear or horror, but acknowledges a clear limit to the extent of the horror. Evil remains courteous and confined and generally a stranger to us. Ghosts may droop and be gloomy and dreadful but they should not make us gloomy even if they make us fearful. These books are not intended to depress: quite the contrary. It is worth asking ourselves why not. Do ghost stories not deal with tales of fear, depression, murder and unrest? They do, but the negative or depressive aspect of any ghost story is likely to be counter-balanced, and that is certainly the case in these stories, by a nostalgic appeal. We expect our vampires to be elaborately and aristocratically dressed. We expect, or at least many of us expect, our ghost stories to be located in an old mansion or church, to be deeply rooted in events which have taken place long ago in surroundings themselves so ancient that they were silent witnesses to those past events. In short, these stories appeal to a tradition and where the reader's traditions are dead or dying, such stories can be called nostalgic and will have a nostalgic appeal. For the same reasons that tourists travel in masses to see the architecture of the past and not of today-reasons aethetic for sure but also spiritual, so people hanker after tales which remind them of a world where the past still breathed and where the dead still walked. Filled with anguish and longing together, we will that the dead walk again, that not all graves are silent. The world of these tales may have been troubled and corrupt but there was still life among the ruins. The modern world, without ghosts, is fashioned after the Death Star of "Star Wars", a world with no echoes and with no history. Our modern world is a networked vulgarity, an over-exposure, a world with its share of horror but devoid of ghosts. These ghosts stories are all history, all soul and the spirits who haunt the pages of these tales are the spirits of the past, our past, come to haunt us, whispering, "come back, come back, it is dark and old and cosy here". Today all glitters and is surface only, we fear the lving not the dead and not living people so much as their creations and their demands. The surface of the past was the heavy iron lid over nightmares but also over dreams of longing, the longing for a world, not perfect, not without the eternal combat of good and evil, but a world in which neither evil nor good was ever, ever conceivably vulgar.
4293932684	Creepy, slow building stories with lots of atmosphere. Most involve a scholar finding something old and then getting freaked out by an event that follows. There aren’t any real ghosts and they aren’t stories that make you jump but they have a tension, some are spinechilling. My favourites were ‘Number 13’ about a hotel room that doesn’t exist; ‘The Ash Tree’, a witch story; and ‘Lost Hearts’, about missing children and a man who wants to live forever.
99985761	M.R. James fue uno de los mejores escritores dedicados al peculiar género de las ghost stories, o historias de fantasmas. Realmente, no se dedicaba a ello profesionalmente; creaba sus historias para contarlas a sus amigos y conocidos, siendo para él más una afición con la que disfrutar enormemente, eso sí, haciéndonoslo pasar "mal". Afortunadamente, se fueron publicando porque se trata, indiscutiblemente, de uno de los maestros del relato breve.Sus cuentos son una delicia escalofriante. M.R. James fue un erudito y arqueólogo de fama reconocida, miembro del Eton College, algo que sale a relucir tanto en el contenido de sus relatos como en la calidad de los mismos. Las historias escritas por James están ambientadas habitualmente en antiguas catedrales, ruinas olvidadas y parajes lúgubres, y nos son relatadas de manera fina y elegante, como cabe esperar de un miembro de Eton. Más que sustos, la sensación que nos transmiten son de un sutil horror, jugando un importante papel la imaginación del lector.Estos son los cuentos reunidos en 'Historias de fantasmas de una anticuario':- EL ÁLBUM DEL CANÓNIGO ALBERICO. Denniston viaja a Saint Bertrand de Comminges, un viejo pueblo situado en los Pirineos, para recabar información de la iglesia del lugar. No contaba con encontrar nada valioso, hasta que llega a sus manos un viejo libro con unas extrañas láminas...- CORAZONES PERDIDOS. Stephen, un joven huérfano, acaba de llegar a la mansión de su primo, el señor Abney, algo que extraña a la vecindad, por el carácter arisco del tal señor Abney. Stephen irá descubriendo la horrible pesadilla en la que se ha visto envuelto. Imprescindible.- EL GRABADO. El señor Williams es un gran aficionado a adquirir viejos grabados y estampas. Como es habitual, recibe un catálogo del señor Britnell, sugiriendo éste que examine cierto grabado que puede ser de su interés. Dicho grabado contiene la vista de una casa de principios del siglo XVIII, y al final lo solicita, junto a otros artículos del catálogo. Poco a poco irá desvelándose la naturaleza del grabado. Otro cuento imprescindible, con imágenes verdaderamente escalofriantes.- EL FRESNO. Existe un gran fresno junto a la casa de Castingham Hall, cuya historia está relacionada con cierta mujer acusada de bruja.- LA HABITACIÓN NÚMERO 13. El señor Anderson viaja a Viborg, Dinamarca, para continuar su investigación sobre la Iglesia de este país, hospedándose para ello en el "León de Oro", concretamente en la habitación número 12. Al subir de cenar, se orienta observando los números de las habitaciones... 14,13, y, por fin, la 12. Cuál no será su sorpresa al enterarse de que el hotel no tiene habitación número 13... Otra muestra del la maestría de James.- EL CONDE MAGNUS. El señor Wraxall viaja a Suecia con motivo del libro de viajes que está escribiendo. Una de sus paradas es la mansión de De la Gardie, toda una antigüedad. Entre las reliquias se encuentra el retrato de Magnus, el primer De la Gardie, por quien siente un vivo interés; incluso querrá visitar el mausoleo de la familia...- ¡SILBA Y ACUDIRÉ! Parkins, profesor del St. James College, decide pasar unos días jugando al golf en la costa, concretamente en Burnstow. Al enterarse de la noticia, un colega le pedirá que eche una mirada a cierto convento de templarios, para saber si vale la pena excavar allí más adelante. Será cumpliendo este deseo cuando Parkins encuentre un curioso silbato... Estupendo relato.- EL TESORO DEL ABAD THOMAS. Cuenta la leyenda que el abad Thomas ocultó un tesoro, dejando ciertas pistas para que fuese encontrado. Y en ello anda el anticuario Somerton, al que seguiremos en su investigación, pesquisa tras pesquisa. ¡Cuánto hubiese dado por no hallar el secreto! Imprescindible.
1123518835	Montague Rhodes James (1862 ~ 1936) is the father of the English ghost story. His short stories are, quite simply, the finest traditional supernatural tales ever penned by mortal man. Utterly lacking in gore and in-your-face horror, James' fiction relies on the delicate manipulation of the reader's imagination to create a subtle, uneasy sort of suspense. James has inspired and unsettled countless writers and readers since his tales first came into print, and his popularity and influence remain undiminished.Ghost Stories of an Antiquary was published by Edward Arnold in 1904, bound in brown buckram, with superb illustrations by James McBryde. The first of James' collections of ghost stories, it is also widely considered to be the best. Of the eight stories included in this volume, James wrote in the preface:'The stories themselves do not make any very exalted claim. If any of them succeed in causing their readers to feel pleasantly uncomfortable when walking along a solitary road at nightfall, or sitting over a dying fire in the small hours, my purpose in writing them will have been attained'.Well, I think it's safe to say that James most certainly did achieve his goal. His stories, predominantly involving scholarly bachelor sorts who go ferreting about amongst old manuscripts or poking around in places that are best left unpoked, are delightfully frightening, humorous, and very convincing. Being a distinguished scholar himself, James knew academia and academics, and he created the most believable of scholarly characters when he put pen to paper.'Canon Alberic's Scrap-book' is set in the French town of St Bertrand de Comminges, in the spring of 1883. Dennistoun, a Cambridge man, has travelled from Toulouse to see St Bertrand's church, and is shown about the place by the sacristan, a jumpy little fellow who perpetually glances behind himself, as though he is being followed. The old chap offers to take him home and show him something interesting... Canon Alberic de Mauléon's scrap-book. The book, a large folio bound in the seventeenth century, contains about a hundred and fifty pages, and on each one is fastened a leaf from an illuminated manuscript. And the old man is willing, in fact determined, to sell the book for less than it is worth. Of course, Dennistoun's heart is all a flutter, and he snaps the book up quick sharpish. But the canon's scrap-book comes with more attached to it than a bargain price.'Lost Hearts' is set in 1811 at Aswarby Hall, the home of Mr Abney, a tall, thin and austere bookish recluse, who, according to the Professor of Greek at Cambridge, knows more about later pagan religious beliefs than anyone else. Much to the surprise of his neighbours, Abney has taken in his orphaned cousin, Master Stephen. But Stephen is not the first parentless child to be rescued by the old man, and Abney's actions are not motivated by a generous spirit.In 'The Mezzotint', Mr Williams, who is responsible for enlarging the English topographical drawings and engravings collection of his university's museum, is sent a mezzotint on approval by a London dealer. The picture, a framed view of a manor house, seems unremarkable when it arrives; in fact, Mr Williams turns it over 'with a good deal of contempt'. But, as he soon discovers, the mezzotint is not a mere static image of any typical English country house. Artworks often seem to have a life of their own, but this particular mezzotint does literally have one.Click here to read the rest of the review...
1104449369	Nie ma to jak porcja smakowitej, poczciwej, nie całkiem jednak niewinnej grozy w postaci zbioru jednych z najbardziej kultowych opowiadań gatunku - "Opowieści starego antykwariusza" M.R. Jamesa.Stary antykwariusz zaczyna szeptać z ciemności. Koszmar zaczyna się zazwyczaj bardzo niewinnie. Od czyjejś przypadkowej opowieści. Od świadka niewyjaśnionych wydarzeń. Stary antykwariusz snuje opowieści o ruinach opactw, które skrywają pośród martwych kamieni swoje mroczne tajemnice. O przeklętych, oślizgłych potworach, które szukają zemsty zza grobu. O okultystach, którzy igrają z ciemnymi mocami, by zajść o krok za daleko w swojej mrocznej sztuce. O dziwnych przedmiotach, które przywołują uśpione wspomnienia lub całkiem realne demony ukryte za woalem rzeczywistości. O księgach, manuskryptach, zwojach i bibliotekach, w których słowa mają niepojęte moce.Bo groza u M.R. Jamesa - jak na brytyjskiego akademika rodem z XIX wieku przystało - swój początek ma zazwyczaj pośród książek właśnie. Rodzi się pośród manuskryptów, starych spleśniałych zwojów, pośród zapomnianych regałów bibliotek. Wystarczy opowieść, legenda, zaklęcie ukryte między słowami, by narodził się potwór, duch, tajemnicza obecność i idące za nią przekleństwo. W "Opowieściach starego antykwariusza" strach również czai się między słowami. Groza nie jest dosłowna, ale rozłożona w czasie, igrająca tak z bohaterami, jak i z samym czytelnikiem. Czasami dosłowna, namacalna w swojej realności, ale najczęściej nie do końca realna, nadmiernie nawet tajemnicza, starodawna, a jednak wciąż działająca na wyobraźnię.Nic dziwnego, że opowiadania M.R. Jamesa przetrwały próbę czasu i doceniają je także współcześni czytelnicy. Nie szkodzi, że nie do końca straszą, nie szkodzi, że nie przerażają do szpiku kości. Stanowią jednak fantastyczne klasyczne opowieści o duchach, napisane w równie klasycznym stylu, które oczarowują i sprawiają moc frajdy, szczególnie w mroczne, zimowe wieczory.Polujcie na "Opowieści starego antykwariusza" M.R. Jamesa. Jest w nich coś uniwersalnego, coś, co znamy z dziecięcych lat, ze starych filmów. A jednocześnie ten akademicki sznyt i brytyjski czarny humor, którym jego groza jest podszyta. Może nie zostają w głowie na długo, ale pozostawiają pewne wrażenie. Uczucie cudzej trwogi. I warto jest znać.
1840000137	Every so often it's good to dip into a classic. Alas, this was the sort of classic that reminded me why it's precisely every so often and not more frequently than that. Widely beloved, widely lauded these are suppose to be among the finest tales of supernatural fiction and yet they didn't do it for me at all. I tried and tried, took several sittings. The book's page count is misleading, it's entered as 94 on GR and 122 on Amazon and yet by my account considering the time spent reading it and the fact that it comprises parts 1 & 2 of James' stories, also published as separate volumes, this should clock out at well over 200 pages. And feels much slower than that. And the thing is objectively I can tell these are suppose to be good stories, quality writing, atmospheric, imaginative...and yet at no point did I find myself engaged or even particularly interested. In fact I think the main reason I finished these is due to my completist nature and general need to try to understand why I wasn't enjoying these stories the way everyone seems to. Were they dated? Sure, but that wasn't the main detraction. I expected them to be dated. Maybe it was the somnolent pacing. Or the fact that these stories were so utterly unexciting. Either way this really didn't work for me, neither entertained as a book should nor spooked as a genre book ought to. It occurred to me that these tales might be more fun if read aloud, maybe this should have been a listen and not a read. In book form...disappointing. But try I did.
3432473828	Umduğum kadar güzel bir kitap çıkmadı. Bunun en büyük sebeplerinden biri de sanırım çevirisiydi. O kadar çok eski Türkçe kelime vardı ki okumamı işkence haline getirdi. Örneğin “mütehassıs” yerine uzman yazmak ya da “müsebbib” yerine sorumlu yazmak çok zor olmamalıydı. Çeviri ciddi anlamda sorunluydu. İçeriğe gelirsek, kitabın ilk yarısı fena değildi. İlk dört öykü kitaptaki en iyi öykülerdi. Yalnız önsözde de belirtildiği üzere yazarın kendine has bir stili vardı. Öykülerin başından sonuna kadar bir adamın yaşadığı gizemli olayları okuyorduk. En sonunda da aniden bir korku ögesiyle karşılaşıyorduk ve öykü zirve yapıp bitiyordu. Ama işin üzücü yanı çoğu öyküde bu son kısımlar yeterince korkunç değildi ve benim hoşuma gitmedi. İlk öyküler iyi olsa da sonrasını pek beğenmedim. Özellikle, bir kilise restorasyonunu anlatan sondan bir önceki öykü beni aşırı sıktı.Kitabın yazılmasının üzerinden yüz seneden fazla geçtiğinden ve kitaptaki olaylar da o eski zamanlarda yaşandığından beni içine çekemedi. Ama tahminimce kapakta da yer alan “çarşafın içinde gezen hayalet” imgesini bu yazar meşhur etmiş olabilir. Kendi dönemi için güzel eserler ortaya koymuş diyebilirim.
65912227	Full review from BadelyngeI love a good ghost story. M.R.James is one of the best at the short form of the genre. Ghost Stories of an Antiquary is packed with some of his best. All the stories here were written between 1894 and 1904 and were originally read to the author's friends at Christmas at Kings College, Cambridge where James was a noted British medieval scholar. I'd guess the best way to experience these chilling little stories would be to have them read to you on a dark night, in the depths of winter, perhaps on Christmas Eve itself. It is probably easier to imagine, listening to the words, that the story is being told to you by someone who has heard the story from another, and that such a tale might be true - just for a short time anyway. James usually cleverly distances the storyteller from the actual protagonists who are often of a scholarly type, quite sanguine (at least at first) in their rejection of the supernatural.
2024067844	While I enjoyed the stories here, I didn't find them at all scary or really all that dark. These are tales to be told of a Christmas eve around the first in the UK, and for that, they're probably perfect. That being said, they're perfectly readable and enjoyable if you're in a fireplace/campfire mood. Reading these now, after recently going through a lot of the classics of the modern horror genre, it seems like a lot of modern writers are stealing from MR James but adding their own twists to make the stories scary -- deeper characters, more detailed setting -- turning short stories into novels. Liz Hand's Wylding Hall comes to mind. Peter Straub's books after Floating Dragon, maybe. The "quiet horror" books that seem to lean on one last twist at the end. (The books where you're not quite sure what happened seem to go back more to The Turn of the Screw.)I'm really glad I read this, but...honestly, of the earlier horror/ghost stories in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, I'm still going to have to admit that I enjoy a few other writers more.
210232513	This is great collection of 7 classic ghost stories. Most relate to traveling scholars and their ghostly encounters. My only complaint is that many of these stories are very similar. Out of the 7, the story Number 13 is my favorite. This is a nice quick read if you are the mood for a few really good ghost stories.
867455553	Όποιος θέλει να τρομάξει πολύ, καλύτερα να επιλέξει ένα άλλο βιβλίο και όχι το Ιστορίες φαντασμάτων ενός αρχαιοδίφη, καθώς είναι περισσότερο μυστήριου παρά τρόμου, ίσως την εποχή που γράφτηκε να θεωρούνταν τρόμου… δεν γνωρίζω. Ο τρόμος μειώνεται με πολλούς τρόπους. Πρώτον ο ήρωας που έχει αίσιο τέλος στο διήγημα, η σωτηρία του προαναγγέλλετε με κάποιο τρόπο στην ιστορία μέσω του αφηγητή, ο οποίος αναφέρει ότι την ιστορία που μας διηγείται την άκουσε από τον ίδιο τον ήρωα. Δεύτερον η τρομακτική ατμόσφαιρα δεν είναι δυνατόν να μας κερδίσει, διότι η τρομάρα αποσιωπάται είτε επειδή ο αφηγητής δεν είναι παρόν σε ένα φόνο οπότε δεν έχουμε ιδέα τη συμβαίνει, -καθώς υποτίθεται ότι είναι αληθινά γεγονότα που τα έμαθε με κάποιο τρόπο, οπότε ο νεκρός πώς να διηγηθεί τη βίωσε;- είτε επειδή οι ήρωες με καλό τέλος όχι απλώς βγαίνουν αλώβητοι αλλά ότι βιώσαν ήταν φευγαλέο, στιγμιαίο. Είναι βεβαία και ο εφησυχασμός από την αρχή ότι του τα δηγήθηκε ο ίδιος ο ήρωας οπότε ναι, ξέρουμε ότι έζησε και είναι καλά. Κατά τα άλλα μου άρεσαν πάρα πολύ αυτές οι ιστορίες, εξαιρετικά πρωτότυπες με εντονότατη δόση μυστήριου κυρίως ειδικά όταν αφήνει αυτά τα αναπάντητα ερωτηματικά, κανείς δεν μπορεί να ξέρει… να είναι σίγουρος τι συνέβη … κανείς δεν μπορεί να είναι τελικά ασφαλής…. Ίσως θα προτιμούσα λίγο λιγότερες περιγραφές του κάθε χώρου που εξελίσσονται αλλά συμβάλλουν και αυτές στη δημιουργία ατμόσφαιρας..
183323950	As Leonardo is to painting, so M R James is to the short ghost story. He really is that good. These stories are like beautifully crafted little gems, rich in tiny, exquisite detail, and sparkling with dark beauty.There is an indefinable rare something that marks out the greatest writers of supernatural fiction. H P Lovecraft had it, and M R James had it. It's a kind of mood, an atmosphere, but it's more than that. Effortlessly, these writers draw you into a world where the most strange and terrible things are entirely plausible; plausible, horrifying and delicious.My words can't do justice to M R James. I can only urge you, if you are someone who enjoys tales of the supernatural, to read any of his stories that you can get your hands on. (There is also a very fine audio-book of this available to download for free at www.librivox.org)
1878824060	Mastery. The rest of his collections have one or two stories I'm not so keen on, but here every one is a classic. Essential.
1362045831	I never liked horror stories, because I'm a sissy and I get very, VERY scared. And I have nightmares and shit, and I can't sleep alone or with the lights out. But lately, I'm really scared of the world. The politics, the social situation, the environmental state, the growth of extremism and terrorism, the floating certainty of war, injustice, and greed. So suddenly, ghosts, ouija boards, demons, and spectres don't seem so scary. They do make my hair stand on end, but they have become a refuge, a fantasy world where the fear is present but less palatable. And this book was an excellent escape. The way M.R James build a story full of ordinary, believable situations to then pour droplets of incredibly powerful visions is absolutely perfect. The horror comes through the senses, not only sight (we are mostly used to that type of horror thanks to Hollywood), but though touch, and smell and taste, and that feeling that someone is staring at you from the corner of your eye. This compilation was supposed to be told, spoken out, not read. So the use of language is so coloquial and well put, you can almost hear the words inside your head, while your brain transforms them into images, and smells, and creaking sounds against your window. A masterpiece. Also, if you are interested in M.R James, I recommend (as it was firstly recommended to me) the documentary "M.R. James Ghost Writer", by the great Marc Gatiss. Excellent combination.
7583566699	Exactly what I want out of my ghost stories: bizarre, baroque excursions into the uncanny & the arcane, placing the emphasis upon the eerie rather than the scary per se. James is particularly masterful at capturing a sense of time suddenly slipping "out of joint" in the sense that his supernatural entities usually feel less like ghosts or demons or evil spirits than as manifestations of history, usually sordid but sometimes just deeply sad, bursting from the past into the present moment, leaving inevitable havoc in its wake. My personal favorites were "The Mezzotint," "Canon Alberic's Scrap-Book," "The Ash Tree," & "The Treasure of Abbott Thomas," but only because certain aspects or implications of their stories particularly appealed to me; all are truly of the highest quality.
5822676835	Officially a M. R. James fanboy now.James uses the “ghost story” as a vehicle to go into some much stranger and more interesting directions than I could ever have expected.Favs were The Mezzotint, The Ash-tree, and Number 13.👌🏼
5067787553	The very first collection by M.R James which was released in 1904. The original edition includes 8 different ghost stories that the author is most well known for."I heard one cry in the night, and I heard one laugh afterwards. If I cannot forget that, I shall not be able to sleep again."
6930773210	A collection of M R James work. Initially, but also at intervals, I found myself steeped in Latin and scholarly works which is off putting when all you want is a ghost story but James’ is the master of a ghost story. In this collection you will find disappearing rooms, haunted rooms , vengeful witch, haunted objects, ghostly children or do you?! The thing with James is he insinuates, leaves stories with ambiguities and more questions than answers and this is the beauty of his writing. Gothic, sinister and uneasy. Not as scary as it once was but he still has the power to play on your mind. This collection includes his Magnus opus ‘Oh whistle and I’ll come to you, my lad’ unlike many others I hadn’t seen the film or read the book so it was the first time for me. I’m still left contemplating what exactly happened and knowing I’ll never have a spare bed in my hotel room again.
784086870	These stories are a delight – finely-crafted ghost stories from the turn of the twentieth century, subversively witty and proceeding to build suspense, menace and even outright horror by insinuation and implication much more than bare narration or depiction.The stories aren't particularly revolutionary, typically beginning with an energetic and atmospheric description of the setting before introducing an urbane and often scholarly narrator who will interact with a relic that provides a doorway to supernatural influences best left undisturbed. However, they are so nicely-wrought, and the narrative voice such a pleasing blend of self-effacement, scepticism and credulity, and the stories do such a great job of stimulating the reader's imagination (without overdoing it), that it's hard not to just lose yourself in them.I've never thought of myself as a fan of the ghost story, but I'm a definite convert to M.R. James.
4600414913	GHOST STORIES OF AN ANTIQUARY is a true “classic” in every sense. First published over 115 years ago by one of history’s most remarkable and remembered horror short story author, this collections of 8 ghost tales is spooky, fascinating, and original. There are a lot of different editions of this book, some poorly made, but this edition by SourceBooks (ISBN: 978-1464215155) is gorgeous. Put together by Horror Writers Association, part of a series of the "Haunted Library of Horror Classics". Edition includes annotations and discussion questions and more.
3492309944	M.R. James Geistergeschichten haben alle gemeinsam dass kaum etwas passiert, was ja nicht unbedingt schlimm wäre. Die Spannung baut sich aber auch dürftig auf, daher können die Geschichten auch nicht mit einer dichten, düsteren Atmosphäre aufwarten. Außerdem ist das Böse letztendlich immer ähnlich, der Satan höchstpersönlich der erscheint in der ein oder anderen Form. Ich fand es langweilig und unkreativ. Der Schreibstil ist schlicht und einfach gehalten.Kein Vergleich zu Joseph Sheridan le Fanu dessen Schreibstil alleine schon ein Genuss für mich ist.
4859858317	It has been argued that M.R. James produced the greatest of ghost stories. I agree.
4617564238	Puanım 3/5 (%65/100)İçerisinde M. R. James'in en çok bilinen öykülerinden 9 tanesi bulunuyor. İngiliz edebiyatı dışında bütün dünya için önemli bir korku yazarı ve benim de favorilerimden Lovecraft'ı bile etkileyen türde bir yazar James. Kitap benim için mükemmeldi diyemem fakat genel olarak hoşuma gitti. Bir çok yazarı etkilemiş ve hikayelerinin bir çoğu da filmlere ve başka hikayelere yön vermiş birisi olduğu için saygı duymak gerek. Ayrıca ara ara koyulan görseller de güzeldi. Uzatmadan, çok spoiler vermeden her öyküden ve benim düşüncelerimden kısaca bahsedeceğim.1-Islığı Çalarsan Gelirim Yanına, ArkadaşBaşlığını bir Robert Burns şiirinden alan ve benim kitapta en beğendiğim öykülerden birisiydi. Hikaye Parkins adlı bir adamın eski bir düdük bulması ve bundan sonra başına gelen paranormal olaylar üzerinden gidiyor. Oldukça başarılıydı ve gerçekten geriliyorsunuz okurken. Sonu biraz hayal kırıklığına uğrattı sadece. 4/5.2-13 NumaraBir otelin 12 numaralı odasında kalan adamın başına gelen olaylardan bahsediyor. 13 numaranın lanetli olması gibi bir ana düşüncesi var. Kısa ama genel olarak hoştu. 3/5.3-Runik LanetlerKarswell adlı gizemli bir adamın eserlerini inceleyen Dunning ve onu belaya süren bir lanet üzerinden geçiyor. Kısaydı ve fena değildi. 2/5.4-Yitik KalplerÖlümsüzlüğü arayan kuzeni Abney'nin yanına kalmaya giden genç Stephen Elliott'ın hikayesini anlatan oldukça güzel bir öyküydü. 3.5/5.5-Dişbudak AğacıGerçekten gizemli ve gerilim uyandıran bir öykü. 17. yy sonunda cadı olduğuna inanılıp öldürülen Bayan Mothersole ve onun ölümünden sonra gerçekleşen doğa üstü olaylar üzerinden geçiyor. Bu da kitapta en çok sevdiğim öykülerden oldu. 4/5.6-Rahip Alberic'in Kitabıİngiliz bir turistin Fransa'da Rahip Alberic'in eski kitabını bulması ve kitabın arkasındaki Süleyman ve bir iblisin resmini görmesi ile alakalı diyebilirim. Çok bir olay olmuyor fakat resim önemli yer taşıyor. Fena değildi genel olarak. 2/5.7-SıçanlarKüçük bir handa konaklayan Thomson ve kilitli odalardan birisinde değişik bir varlıkla karşılaşmasını anlatıyor. Güzel bir atmosfer yarattığı için beğendim. 3/5.8-Katedral Tarihinden Bir VakaBir vampir öyküsü olarak da kabul ediliyor. Southminster Katedrali yenilenirken bir mezar bulunuyor ve insanlar ölmeye başlıyor. Betimlemeler güzeldi. Genel olarak güzeldi diyebilirim. 2.5/5.9-Karanlık Çöktükten Sonra Playing Fields'taM. R. James'in de zaman geçirdiği Eton Kolejinde anlatıcının bir baykuş ile geçen konuşmasını anlatıyor. Oldukça kısaydı ve genel olarak eehh işte diyebileceğim bir türden hikayeydi. Yarım kalmış bir karalama tadındaydı o yüzden diyecek çok şeyim yok. 1.5/5.
6659284130	M.R. James es un maestro indiscutible a la hora de crear atmósfera. En esta colección, su prosa elegante y metódica transporta al lector a un mundo de bibliotecas oscuras, pueblos costeros y manuscritos olvidados con una eficacia admirable. El terror que construye no es de sustos fáciles, sino de una inquietud sutil que se filtra lentamente, lo que demuestra un profundo entendimiento del género.Sin embargo, el enfoque de James prioriza la sugerencia y el ambiente por encima de un desarrollo narrativo convencional. Esto se traduce en que algunos relatos, tras construir una premisa fascinante y un suspense muy efectivo, optan por un desenlace deliberadamente abrupto. Mientras que para algunos lectores esta elipsis es parte de su genialidad, permitiendo que la imaginación complete el horror, para otros puede resultar en una sensación de historia incompleta o que no llega a explotar todo su potencial.La obra es, en esencia, un ejemplo puro de terror sobrenatural clásico. Su valor reside más en el viaje y en la atmósfera de pesadilla que en giros argumentales complejos o en un cierre redondo. Es una lectura ideal para quien aprecie la sugerencia y la elegancia por encima de la explicación detallada, aunque puede dejar con gamas de más desarrollo a quienes busquen una narrativa con un arco más definido.
983281885	MR James's stories have nearly everything that a classic ghost story should have. Period settings, for us at least, although as an Edwardian he wrote a lot about the Victorian period. Geographic settings usually in cold and foreign climes, Germany, Denmark and Sweden, like us but foreign too. The anti-heroes are invariably bachelors who are also chaste University dons, like himself, alone singular and scholastic. Many are religious but are men of reason who have this reason challenged by much older beliefs which have elements of evil within them. Basically this is everything but Protestantism. They are subtle, bloodless and goreless, but ultimately chilling like the settings, the characters and the author himself, by way of his style.Behind the stories are James's engagement with the irrational which includes paganism, Catholicism and in the first story Canon Albrecht's Tale, demonology as it appears in the " Old Testament" in the stories of King Solomon, which therefore must include Judaism. James demonizes literally any form of non-Protestant religious practice, the darkness taking the form of the other religions mentioned. As enjoyable as they are the underlying religious implications for these tales when read together, only serve to show that MR James saw demons elsewhere and not within his own hallowed vestries.http://www.bookdepository.com/?a_aid=...
4791002578	M. R. James is considered by many to be among the best ghost story writers ever. An academic, in fact, an antiquarian, he knew whereof he wrote. My blog post (Sects and Violence in the Ancient World) mentions that these aren’t terribly scary for modern readers, but they do have a distinctive atmosphere. There are eight stories in this collection, and it is one of five such volumes by James.Probably the most famous story James wrote is in this collection: “Oh, Whistle, and I’ll Come to You, My Lad.” It may not send shivers down modern spines but it is creepy nevertheless. One caution: for readers unacquainted with the style from this period some of the action may be a bit tricky to follow. I’ve been reading quite a lot of material with gaps left, and that set me in good stead here. “Oh, Whistle” was made into a movie some years back, by the way.This is a no frills Dover edition. Sturdily bound, it does have a brief introduction, but otherwise it’s just the reader and James. He is a gracious host—the stories were meant to be oral and there is an informality about them that makes them fairly charming, even if dealing with ghosts and demons. A fairly brief book, it doesn’t take too much effort to finish.
1759127294	I came across a reference to one of the stories in this book, "Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad", which has been filmed for UK TV a couple of times. It is probably the best story in the book, though I quite enjoyed a couple of others as well.As ghost stories, they really weren't very scary, but I suppose we have been toughened up a lot by films and television since these stories were written, to say nothing of books such as "The Little Stranger" by Sarah Waters. Now that one is really something! Okay, but I won't bother to download any more of James' books.
1620806275	Ghost stories for medieval history majors. Excellent. I have read and enjoyed a few of these before in various anthologies but reading them together is a far more satisfying experience. James was a master of suspense and the macabre.
65212563	M.R. James was known to me as the editor and translator of the Oxford editon of the Apocryphal New Testament. Finding ghost stories by such a scholar was intriguing and the reading of them was quite pleasant.
2439559083	I love M.R.James' writing style. Loved him when I read his ghost stories back when I was a kid in 2002...love him still !
40977777	One of the great classic collections of gothic literature. Still with the ability to chill.
829900954	Some of these are creepy as balls, and had me staying awake with my sheets tight around me even when I hadn't slept for days.
7917837755	I don't expect this review to have any influence, there are over 500 reviews against this edition on GR and as the stories in this title have appeared again and again under various titles, never mind excerpted individually into other anthologies, the actual number of reviews is almost impossible to calculate. But in terms of 'horror' fiction James is review proof, rather like H.P. Lovecraft, the other writer of 'classic/vintage' horror to whom he is often compared (but more about Lovecraft later).I first read James when I was at school in Ireland, I cannot remember the edition it certainly wasn't this one, and I also know it was not an edition of the complete stories. Who knows but maybe I actually read a first edition? Such things were not unlikely in the 1970s. The stories impressed me but, I cannot separate my response to the stories on the page from the BBC adaptations of five of his stories for their 'Ghost story or Christmas' series - one in particular 'Lost Hearts' was to haunt me for years long after I had forgotten its origin on TV or as a James story. All of this is really a prelude to saying that I can't really step back and judge these stories independently because they are to inextricably tied up whether as original stories or adaptations in my young formative adolescent years. I have read them again with pleasure and if I had now read them for the first time I am sure I would still have enjoyed them. But would they have the same impact? Probably not but all the same I award the stories the stars and shelving accolades that I couldn't award them as a 12/13 year old.I think one of the reasons I enjoyed James's stories was that as a child in the 1960s and an adolescent in the 1970s my 'horror' sensibility was formed in part by classic Hollywood horror but even more by the Hammer horror films. The atmosphere of the Hammer films created out of the detritus of Victorian/Edwardian set dressing and costumes easily dovetailed or was adapted in my imagination to James's stories. Frock coats, gentlemen scholars/archaeologists, ancient incunabula it is surprising how many of these tropes were to be found even as late as Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series (1997-2001).What I can do now is contrast the stories by James with the work of H.P. Lovecraft (which I didn't read until I was much, much older). I don't like Lovecraft and find that his barely concealed racism towards non WASP immigrants and not-at-all concealed obsession with miscegenation and his desire to see the state step in and put a stop to it I find utterly repellent. As far as I am concerned the ugly basis of so much of Lovecraft's fiction is not excused by the, to me, banalities of his Cthulu Mythos which I recognise is, inexplicably, a source of inspiration to writers today.But of course when I compare Lovecraft with James I can't help noting that the later wrote most of his best stories in the years before WWI - in that retrospectively glorious, if morally flawed, era of late Victorian/Edwardian grandeur when Britain comfortably ruled the waves and so much of the world and to be an English gentleman was the unquestioned, by other English gentlemen, cynosure of everyone's desire. Lovecraft on the other hand wrote most of his stories post WWI, and he seems to have adopted, and clung to, the fashionable ideas of Oswald Spengler that Scott Fitzgerald so satirised in 'The Great Gatsby' via the character of the oafish Tom Buchanann who misidentifies Spengler's name and that of his famous book, which makes his earnest and pessimistic rant about racial supremacy and the decay civilisation even more absurd.James is not a mouthpiece for British imperialism, though no doubt he was one, he emerges from his time but is not bound by it, rather like those 'Victorian' settings for the Hammer horror films. Lovecraft seems, to me, much more of his time and to echo, loudly, its ugliest features.But as I admit James was a formative force of my earliest most impressionable adolescent years. The only other author from those years I still cherish is Saki who is infinitely greater than James. So I can't step back and judge him - I leave you to do that for yourselves.
7830649962	I will not bother trying to rationalize the chain of decisions and discoveries that led me to the doorstep of this tome. Some thoughts: - This isn't a disapointed three stars; I enjoyed reading this collection. - The little digging I did into James points to him as an innovator in the horror and spooky anthropology genres. Apparently he popularized a lot of what is now commonplace in both fields, and I can see bits of his influence in Dan Brown and... Indiana Jones. - The 'I-am-relaying-a-story-that-did-not-happen-to-me-but-I-heard-about-from-a-friend' method of storytelling gets old after about two stories. It also takes you out of the story at times and serves to lighten the otherwise morbid mood. - That said, the asides making fun of golf talk was good stuff. You can tell James wrote these stories with the aim of sharing them with a few of his close friends, which is pretty neat! - The style also allowed for translations of the Latin and the French throughout in the forms of footnotes. My Latin has deteriorated and my French never teriorated and so that, too, was much appreciated. - I think James wanted to be an architectural critic. He spends precious paragraphs describing the houses of his characters, commenting on the design choices the builders made and what updates added to the original effort and which detracted from it, or indeed rendered the original structure unrecognizable. - Poe remains at the top of my Macabre writers. James falls behind him and the redditor who wrote "Autopilot" in like 2016, but well ahead of James Patterson.
6437948188	3.5 stars Thanks to Federico DN, I accessed the public domain version of this book online for free. I started reading but then took it one step further and realised YouTube had an audiobook version, also in the public domain via Librovox, read by Peter Yearsley, see link below:-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjdwM... (Free) I was able to listen to this selection of ghost stories whilst crocheting, or ghost-cheting!!! Mwha ha ha ha, see what I did there! Oh dear, I think I've lost the plot!! Anyhoo, this was a good old mixed bag of stories. Some were really good, some not so good. Some were scary, some were just curious.

3566983307	Non conoscevo l'autore e sono stata molto contenta di averlo scoperto. Sei racconti gotici semplicemente stupendi, che lasciano il lettore inquieto e con la sensazione di non essere solo nella stanza. Centellinato per farlo durare il più a lungo possibile. Prossimo obiettivo: gli altri racconti di Rhodes James.

1820523385	Wonderful collection of eight ghost stories. These are delectably creepy, but the narration is always second or third hand by a friendly narrator. The readers for this audiobook version did an excellent job reading in a crisp British accent and allowing the supernatural bits of the story to sneak up on the listener. I listened to several of these as I was cooking for Thanksgiving and it was excellent company to kitchen work.The author is a scholar and it shows in these stories. There are historians and professors, research into ancient texts and objects leading to encounters with ghostly undead and other ghastlies. James does enough to describe these to make them specific, but also leaves a lot to the reader's imagination and the general atmosphere set by the story.Recommended.
1021796327	This book feels like a 101 in horror stories. It's got so many features that have become classic themes on the horror genre. Cursed objects, demonic encounters, witches, haunting creatures, ancient hidden treasures. The stories are narrated as real events experienced by acquaintances of the author or as discoveries he read on old books and such. I think this was a device to give the stories a feel of authenticity but I wasn't much taken by it. However, I enjoyed the inclusion of biblical references and gothic descriptions of buildings.Nice collection of short stories, a recommended read for those interested in the origins of modern ghost stories.
4744482135	What can I say? The classics are classics for a reason. Excellent short stories, full of old manor houses and ancient churches, cursed objects and the shrouded dead. Stories that give just that little thrill of excited terror without actually giving you nightmares.I've read every story in this collection before, in one anthology or another. I've read some of them multiple times. And yet...I still get that same dark shiver of dread as I read them for the second, or third, or fourth time.These are classic ghost stories, first published around the turn of the last century, and I don't think they'll ever get old.
1840771333	Nawet po Blackwoodzie, Machenie i Gaskell, James wciąż wywarł na mnie silne wrażenie. Pierwsze opowiadania w zbiorze dowodzą niezwykle plastycznej wyobraźni, nawet powtarzanie tych samych motywów w kolejnych tekstach nie odebrało im przerażające wydźwięku. Gaskell przeraziła mnie jednym swoim opowiadaniem, Blackwood kreował świetny nastrój, a Machen miał dziwaczne pomysły, ale to James pisze horrory z prawdziwego zdarzenia. (Aczkolwiek ostatnie opowiadania w tomie to były potworne, przewidywalne dłużyzny i ziewałam na nich).
1429256471	I love M.R. James' ghost stories and am listening (again) to Peter Yearsley's fine reading of them (free from Librivox). Since James wrote these to read aloud to the schoolboys on Christmas Eve (in the fine old British tradition of ghost stories for Christmas), these are best savored when heard.
1252430080	I am a sucker for a good ghost story... especially one which comes in the wrappings of a 19th century British scholar and the assertion the tales are real events he's come across in his studies. I loved all the stories, but The Mezzotint stayed with me the longest. I've even gone as far as to research the print.
1769035038	i started each story with "oh this isn't bad" and ended every one with "i've made a terrible mistake." these are great, atmospheric, traditional ghost stories - i read a few each night before bed.
478791386	Understated creepiness at its best.
