4839027864	4.5 starsUmmmmm I finally read this. And can we talk about how adorable the books in this series are!? I mean, sure they follow a family of psychopath serial killers, but they're so sweet and fall so hard in love! August is a professor and a psychopath. When he meets Lucas at work, he knows Lucas immediately knows what he does after touching him. Lucas used to work for the FBI and is able to see visions of what people do when he touches them. When he touches August, he's terrified. He was forced out of the FBI because no one believed him when he claimed another FBI agent was horrifically killing women. Lucas wants to keep a low profile, but once August meets him, August wants him. August was ADORABLE and I loved how he just decided he wanted to be with Lucas. He was persistent without being creepy and I loved it. Someone from Lucas's past is threatening him, and August is SO PROTECTIVE and it was so cute. And their interactions with August's family were so fun. I loved how we had Noah and Adam from book one in here so much. Yes, August is still killing people for his family, but the romance was just so sweet! I can't get enough of these book and I am so excited to read the next brother's story!
4210806416	4 “I licked it so it’s mine” stars ✨We are getting hints of Thomas and Aiden and I’m here for that shittttt. How long do I have to wait for them!?!?😭😭😭 “I can relate to that,” August said. “Imagine being the weirdest psychopath in a house full of psychopaths.” This book was exactly what I expected. It was grim and gruesome with just the perfect added blend of romance and psycho obsessions. August Mulvaney has official carved his name on my heart, August >>> Adam right now. “Is it true you remember every word ever said to you?” “Did Noah tell you that?” August asked,“He said you always wear headphones to drown out the noise. I’ve never seen you wear them.” August brushed his hair aside, removing the tiny earbuds from his ears. “They’re not on. I don’t wear them around you.”“Why not?” August frowned in confusion. “Because I want to remember every word you say to me.”Both August and Lucas are professors. Lucas has a reputation of being a clairvoyant and after running away from August after touching him, August is intrigued by Lucas and begins to chase him. I loved this relationship. It was a very quick- no nonsense- no bullshiting- relationship. August was very clear from the start that Lucas was all he wants and will do everything to keep him. August gets all the 4 stars. It’s just him. “If it comes down to random strangers or you, I’ll choose you every time. I’ll literally burn this world to ash before I let somebody hurt you. I don’t care who suffers because of it. I know that’s intense and weird but I need you to know I mean it. You’re not going to die, and I’m not letting you go. If you’re going to leave me, you’re going to have to kill me first. Please, kill me first.” This book was GRAPHIC. very grim and the crimes that happened genuinely made me uncomfortable so please for godsake check the trigger warnings before going into this book. “It’s just headphones,” Lucas said. August shook his head. “It’s not just headphones. I don’t know what love feels like, but I imagine it’s like the feeling I’m having right now.” Lucas’s face went soft, his smile radiant. “That’s the sweetest thing anybody’s ever said to me after cutting off another man’s nipple.” I loved Lucas’ ability to have visions when he touches an object. It made my reading way more fun, especially when we learn about how Kohn manipulâtes that ability and traumatised Lucas, it was very thrilling. This authors writing works well for me, it’s engaging and with everything that happens in this book - I appreciate it not being an information dump. “Say it again.” “Shower. Sex. Cheesecake?” Lucas asked. “No, home,” August prompted. Lucas smiled softly. “You are the world’s most sentimental psychopath. Now, take me home.” But I have to say that I really don’t like this cover. I went on her Instagram page and the inspiration she used for both August and Lucas look nothing like this cover🤔Overall, this was another great instalment in this series. Much better than the first book but it took a little longer for me to get into it. “You’re so hung up on time. It took me seven seconds to figure out you’re it for me. If the passage of time is so important to you, I’ll wait. Even if it takes you seven weeks or seven months or seven years, but don’t let time be the only reason to keep us from doing what we both want. We don’t have to explain ourselves to anybody.” I CANNOT WAIT FOR ATTICUS AND JERICHOO!! The chapter I saw was so interesting and Jericho sounds like the perfect match for Atticus. UGHHJ THIS AUTHOR IS GOING TO MAKE ME LOSE SLEEP. “I’m a psychopath,” Atticus blurted. The stranger leaned forward, his whisper conspiratorial. “I’m a Scorpio. I still like banging dudes.”
6315557897	3.5 StarsThis book was good but I didn't like it as much as the first one. August and Lucas were great but I sometimes got bored reading it. just like the first book this is also insta love so if you don't like reading insta love then this isn't for you. I was looking for something fast paced and this deliveredI don't know how Lucas got his powers but I am here for it. One of the problems I had with this was the whole blood thing I don't know what the kink is called but it's not my cup of tea. it just made me so uncomfortable.August was just so funny sometimes especially the part where he tells his brothers about Lucas,“I think somebody knows about me.” [...] “we still need to take it seriously. What are you going to do?” [...] “I don’t want to hurt him… Not much, anyway. Just a little. I want to see what I can do…what he’ll let me get away with before he pushes back.” Atticus’s eyes bulged. “What are you talking about?” 😭😭“I want to know about you.” [...] “You do?” Lucas asked. August frowned. “Of course. If I’m going to marry you someday, I should probably know what I’m getting into.”He was also so freaking sweat for somebody who doesn't have any emotions, “Is it true you remember every word ever said to you?” “Did Noah tell you that?”“He said you always wear headphones to drown out the noise. I’ve never seen you wear them.” "I don’t wear them around you.”“Why not?” August frowned in confusion. “Because I want to remember every word you say to me.”“Well, why did you answer the phone in the first place?” “Because it was you,” August said, as if the answer was obvious. “When your significant other calls, you answer.”“I licked it so it’s mine isn’t a thing in dating.” August’s hands came around to grip Lucas’s ass, his gaze heated as he said, “I did, though. I want to do it again. Right now.”These psychopaths just make me swoon all the freaking time.“You want me to teach you how to torture somebody?” He did. He really did. “Yes, please.”Welcome to gang. “Lucas crossed the room and pulled something from his pocket. August’s air pods. “I saw them in the center console and figured you could use them. I know the screaming bothers you.” 🫠“You’re so hung up on time. It took me seven seconds to figure out you’re it for me. If the passage of time is so important to you, I’ll wait. Even if it takes you seven weeks or seven months or seven years”'Umnishka' That's all I have to say1. Unhinged - 4.5 Stars2. Psycho - 3.5 Stars3. Moonstruck - 4.5 Stars3.5 Damaged - 2.5 Stars4.

4456204727	loved this romance with a serial killer and an ex-FBI agent who has clairvoyant abilitiesit was oddly very sweet
4165122660	***I received an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review.***A psycho and a psychic... what a pair they make. I had so much fun while reading this story!!! Both August and Lucas were a blast and seeing their relationship develop was an enjoyable reading experience. Psycho focuses on the unlikely love story between August, a psychopathic professor who murders criminals in his spare time, and Lucas, an ex-FBI profiler now a fellow professor who is clairvoyant. Psycho has a fascinating premise where August struggles with relating socially to others and lacks any meaningful and true personal connections with others. Meanwhile, Lucas also struggles to connect with others because of his visions and impressions of others through a simple touch. Lucas and August literally run into one another leaving Lucas horrified at the truth beneath August's professor exterior. August on the other hand is instantly smitten, which leads to an obsession and fascination with his shocked co-worker. Psycho is a fast-paced romantic thriller that is filled with sweet moments of devotion between both MCs that depicts mixed within a mystery of epic proportions. I love learning about this crazy family of psychopaths and seeing each family member get their HEA. This was another winning installment in the Necessary Evils series and I cannot wait for the next one.
5521369559	“I don’t care that we barely know each other. It’s just you. You’re the one for me, and if I can’t have you, I’d rather not exist anymore.” Me giving another insta love story a 5-star rating? Who even am I? The Mulvaney’s basically own me at this point. There was nothing I would change about book one and I was like, there is no way book two could get any better than that right? WRONG. Book one was perfect in my eyes, but here I am, loving this one ever more somehow. August has moved to my number one Mulvaney so far. August is smart a hell with an IQ of 155, he was talking fluently before he was even walking. Yet, he is literally the most clueless, adorable, and endearing psychopath ever. He had me awing, giggling, and kicking my feet and also sweating..because damn he was sexy as hell. And Lucas, such a hot, soft, perfect, precious human being, I understand August’s insane possessiveness towards Lucas because I want to protect him with my whole being as well. Here are some examples of how fucking cute August was 🥺 August examined his face. “You’re really very pretty.” He didn’t just say you’re pretty, he said you’re really very pretty 😭 Why are those simple details so damn endearing and cute?! It makes me want to cry. “Help me,” August begged. “What does somebody do or say or wear on a first date?” August pleading to get his family to help him with how he's supposed to act like on a first date 😭 “You’re really into him, huh?” Noah asked, dragging August from his thoughts. “He’s…perfect,” August said. “I can’t feel guilt or remorse, but the thought of not seeing your face or touching you, kissing you, makes me feel…like there’s a hole in my chest. Does that make sense?” Thomas Mulvaney may have raised a bunch of psychopaths, but damn did he ever teach them how to treat a person right. August doesn’t have any experience with relationships, and he has no idea how to treat a significant other, and because of that he goes and reads countless books about relationships to help him 😭 The insta love worked amazingly, I felt their connection the instance they met. Just the passion and trust they had for each other was so perfect, absolutely swoonworthy. You could easily tell how much they loved each other. Words can’t express how I feel about their relationship. “Did you know he has an eidetic memory? He can recall every word he’s ever heard or seen without even trying. But he hates it. He said it makes his head too noisy. He plays music almost all the time so he doesn’t carry around stranger’s voices in his head for the rest of his life.” Lucas shrugged. “He never wears them around me.” Noah once more studied Lucas before saying, “Then he must really like you. Because August values silence over almost anything.” … “He said you always wear headphones to drown out the noise. I’ve never seen you wear them.” August brushed his hair aside, removing the tiny earbuds from his ears. “They’re not on. I don’t wear them around you.” “Why not?” August frowned in confusion. “Because I want to remember every word you say to me.” They really need to stop because they have me in an absolute chokehold. I don’t think I’ve swooned this hard in a book ever. What made it a completely different level of swoon was because August did it without trying. He was so clueless and just did what came to his mind. It was innocent and romantic, and he was so genuine without even trying 😭The banter between the brothers had me absolutely dying of laughter. My excitement just keeps increasing as I get more insight into each of the brothers. I’m truly excited for all of their stories and can’t wait to start the next book. Seeing Adam and Noah again was a delight. Adam is still whipped AF 😍Necessary Evils SeriesBook #1 - Unhinged - 5 stars ❤️Book #2 - Psycho - 5 stars ❤️Book #3 - Moonstruck - 4.5 starsBook #4 - Headcase - 3 starsBook #5 - Mad Man - 3 starsBook #6 - Lunatic - 3.5 starsBook #7 - Maniac - 2 stars
4095306248	Onley James knows how to do insta-love and OTT storylines so well *chef kiss*I think I liked Book 1 a bit better but this one was still very enjoyable. Love the Mulvaney brothers and their obsessive version of love. Soooo excited for the rest of the series!!
4095626634	I really liked this!Did I miss some depth? Sometimes.Was it like the first book? Almost exactly.Do psychopaths really act as sweet as Adam or August? Most definitely not.Did I care? Nope! These books are awesome!I know a sociopath in RL and while he is a good person, he cannot help but be selfish. He is actually pretty unliked by almost everyone, because he doesn’t get social clues. And while that may sound endearing, it’s actually pretty annoying when someone just starts talking about himself (again) no matter the situation or whoever he is talking to. He has been trying to condition himself his whole life to act like other people do, and to respond correctly, but he just doesn’t quite get it right.Now in Adam and August that sounded endearing and sweet actually. But in RL I highly doubt they can really form deep bonds with people like they end up doing in these books.So everyone should definitely leave reality at the door and just enjoy these psychopaths finding love.
5352194877	Someone please save me from myself with this series.I'm going to be honest, I find the whole concept to be disturbing and unappealing. Yet I keep trying them... I just don't like murder, nor do I find psychopaths (if they even are that...) appealing. Men who probably won't ever love you and claim you like property and don't have a moral compass. Yeah, I'm passing.I keep reading these hoping I'll like them more, and I just don't. I don't get the concept, and I didn't get the reality-stretching paranormal twist to this one. Just throw it on top of all the other unbelievable $hit in this series. Yes, I see why others like these books but I... just don't. I already started the audio for the 3rd, so here is to one last try. goodreads|instagram|twitter|tiktok
4111424521	"I want you to keep pursuing me, but I need to feel like it's not a done deal. I'm an adult and I have bodily autonomy. 'I licked it so it's mine' isn't a thing in dating." Oh yep, Onley James has done it again, with book 2 in her #NecessaryEvils series, Psycho.As you may recall from book 1, Unhinged, this series is about the 7 Mulvaney 'brothers', all psychopaths, raised by their billionaire foster father to right the wrongs that the system doesn't, or can't remedy. Killers for a good cause as it were, but without conscience or guilt or remorse. This is August Mulvaney's story.August is a genius, who totally struggles with the 'noise' of life. He's a tenured Professor by day and a lethal assassin by night. When he meets disagraced former FBI criminal profiler Lucas Blackwell, he wants him. Permanently.Lucas and August's story is full of all the good stuff we've now come to expect from Ms James in this series - a cracker of a story, insta-love (because we're dealing with psychopaths here), huge amounts of steam 🔥🔥🔥 (because duh, it's Onley James), dark humour, gratuitous violence, the good guys winning out over evil and a HEA 💚.Needless to say, this comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and was a steamy 5 ✨✨✨✨✨ read for me.OUT NOW!
4459864817	5 starsDid I just read this in one sitting? Yes. Yes I did and I have no shame I love this so much!August and Lucas have my hart♥️August examined his face "you're really very pretty""Say it again""Shower. sex. cheesecake?"lucas asked"No home" August promptedLucas smiled softly "You are the world's most sentimental phsycopath. Now take me home"This is definitely becoming my favourite series! If you haven't already please read💞
5807199220	Book safety, content warnings, and tropes & tags down below.I feel like I keep repeating myself when it comes to Onley’s books, but they’re all just super entertaining. I didn’t really have any expectations when it came to the second book as I haven’t seen a lot about it, but I really loved August’s character in particular. I am also a massive fan of characters with psychic abilities, so I knew I would enjoy the clairvoyance bit. I would’ve loved even more of it, but it added something fun and different no matter what. “I want to keep him.” “Bruh. Those are thinking thoughts not speaking thoughts,” Noah coached. “You can’t just go around telling strangers you’ve imprinted on them like some werewolf in a Twilight movie. They won’t get it.” My favorite part about a series like this is how you slowly get to know the rest of the characters as well, either before they get their own books, or you get/learn more about characters you already know and love. I especially love how we get more of Noah, as he’s my favorite so far. I immediately started Moonstruck when I finished Psycho, so it’s all blending together a little bit, but that’s honestly a lot of the fun. You could read it is a standalone if you’re not too bothered by a huge cast that features in every book, but I’m definitely enjoying it more by listening in order.

4666535915	Original Review April 2022Who would've thought I'd associate the term “psychopathic killer" with terms such as “adorable” or "endearing."" August Mulvaney was an absolute sweetheart when it came to Lucas, and I had a lot of fun reading it. Reread May 2023I didn't enjoy this as much the second time around, but it was still nice seeing August and Lucas again. I loved how much effort August put into trying to make Lucas comfortable with him. The psycho and the psychic were indeed perfect for each other. 4 stars
4216514920	I'M TRULY INLOVE WITH THIS SERIES AND WITH THE COUPLES. The chemistry is just undeniable, who says what they have isn't love? I love getting little Adam and Noah here and Adam being an cute obedient fiance to Noah and him bringing a DOG to Noah, a new addition to the family! I love dogs so.. Anyway, love how August is from the start. HE IS SO ADORABLE? Lucas and August is just 🙄 The bonus epilogue is probably my favorite lol, even though I love Lucas' last name. Lucas and I have the same addiction to cheesecake. 😩
4213829699	4.5 stars - this series just keeps getting better! The premise behind the storyline, a family of psychopaths who rid the world of evil people, is so original, and the relationships the family forms are so interesting. And hot! Really HOT. As with all of Onley’s books, the heat is off the Richter, and the kinks are… phew. August & Lucas’ connection is instantaneous, and Lucas’ clairvoyant abilities put an interesting spin on the steamy scenes. And while the evils the perpetrators do are deeply disturbing, it’s kinda satisfying to see them suffer for them. Did I really just say that?…. 😳 Can’t wait to read the stories for the rest of the family.
4226162796	4.5 stars!This is the second book in the Necessary Evils series and features August who is a genius, a psychopath and a professor. Like the rest of his brothers, he too appears to be mostly normal on the surface but underneath he is a killer. August has a tendency to have strong attachments to certain objects and when he sees the new professor on campus, Lucas Blackwell...well he becomes his new obsession.Lucas' life has been flipped upside down. He used to be a profiler for the FBI but when he tries to convince them that one of their own is a serial killer because of his clairvoyant gift, they call him crazy and disgrace him. Lucas tries to rebuild his life but the co-worker he tried to take down is still on the loose and now after him. When Lucas meets August he knows he is a killer but August takes the opportunity to show Lucas that not all is what it seems. Lucas and August start to get to know each other and it isn't long before they don't think they will ever be able to part. Each have imprinted on each other's souls. Can Lucas accept who he is and accept August too? Can August help Lucas catch the bad guy?Like the first book in this series, this one had a great plot, some delicious steam and a heartbreaking story. I loved both characters. I wish their sexual kinks had been explored a little more but overall this series is really hitting the spot for me!
5144916737	Even better than the first book.
4209663718	I am honestly a bit dumbfounded at how endearingly, heartwarming this romance is between a literal psychopath murderer and the FBI profiler he has a relationship. This is such a fascinating read and James does an EXCELLENT job of capturing so much vulnerability between August and Lucas I just DIE. I love this series SO MUCH. It is just EXACTLY giving me everything I ever wanted in a serial killer romance.
4190132093	You're my obsession...Guilty pleasure sexy times!Psycho/hic "love" match.Still my favorite of the series!
4201443224	“The psycho and the psychic. We’re truly not fit for anybody but each other. We’re stuck together.” In a surprise to absolutely no one, I loved this and finished it in one sitting, skipping dinner to read it. I loved Unhinged (book 1 in the series) SO much, I read it a few weeks ago and still sift through my highlights almost nightly. I think when you love a book that much, you worry the sequel won’t live up to it. So I was excited but nervous when I was kindly offered an ARC, but …. DON’T WORRY GUYS, IT’S AMAZING. (And it should be out soon, and available on Kindle Unlimited!)If you enjoy:-Psychopathic, overprotective heroes-Geniuses who can’t read emotions or social cues-Vigilante murderer + ex-FBI agent-Dark MM romance with some very funny moments …please give this series a try. (Triggers/content warnings at the end of this review.) This book felt very different from Unhinged, but in a good way. The author allowed August and Lucas to shine through, she didn’t try to replicate Adam and Noah. August is a psychopath, but he’s also autistic - making it doubly hard for him to read social cues. He’s self aware because of the teachings of his adopted father but usually delayed in remembering his teachings, which results in him coming off as creepy. Lucas is a new professor at August’s college, hired after he was let go from the FBI and put in a mental institution for being “crazy” after accusing a colleague of being a serial killer. See, Lucas is psychic - he can pick up memories/readings/visions off of objects. Lucas immediately picks up that August is a killer, but August sets out to prove he’s a different kind of killer. One who will keep Lucas safe. And then they team up to go after Lucas’ scummy ex-colleague. Adventure time! We get so many fun cameos in this book. Of course we see Adam/Noah, the couple from the first book, but we get a closer glimpse into the other brothers. Atticus, the starchy and kind of douchey one. Archer, the alcoholic pirate. Aiden, the bitter one who’s cut off their father and lives separated from them. Asa and Avi, the creepy twins who like killing as much as August. And we get a few hints to Thomas’ past… (please let him get a book, please let him get a book) August is different than I expected. Based on his scenes from Unhinged, which were basically just him being a murderer while dancing to pop songs, I thought he was going to be an over-the-top goofy murderer, like Diesel from Den of Vipers. And while I adore the archetype of a goofy psycho like Diesel, August was wonderful. The reasons for his constant need for music and his hatred of loud noises/bright light totally made sense. It was kind of like… “Oh, thats who August is. That totally makes sense.” I have so many highlights but I hesitate to put more in here (even though it would 100% make my point) because I don’t want to spoil you reading them for the first time with your own two eyes. I need a million more books like this. Someone please feed my addiction.TW: August was abused as a child; Lucas can see visions of women being graphically tortured; on page murder and graphic torture; mentions of partaking in sex work (consensual)
4314275746	This series blew my socks off so far! I listened to Hans Zimmer tracks in the background and literally forgot I was reading. Onley’s style of describing action is brilliant. The love story makes my heart flutter, and I suddenly find myself very into psychopaths, so thanks for that Onley!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥On to the next one!
7387107750	3.5 stars!i almost forgot how fluffy and insta-love these books are. august and lucas were really cute together and i enjoyed their story more than noah and adam’s. however, i was still disappointed in the action we got towards the end. i feel like the author is missing so many opportunities for one of the brother’s love interest to be injured while on mission, which could lead to some much needed angst. so far, lucas is the only love interest who i can imagine leaving a mission unscathed, considering he’s a ex-FBI agent. i know these books aren’t meant to be realistic, but as i mentioned in my book 1 review, everyone just seems so untouchable, which kind of ruins the book for me. despite all that, i will still continue with the series over time. they’re nice palate cleansers when i want a quick mm read!
4963615533	me gustó solo el último 30% del libro. el resto se me hizo mega tedioso :(
4097790924	No one writes a psychopath like Onley James. How in the world can these heroes be sexy and dare I say...romantic?! There is something compelling about August and his brothers, that keep this reader wondering about them and their personal lives, despite them being vigilante killers. I like them all and August was definitely an interesting hero to get to know.Lucas has his own kind of crazy he lives with. *sorry no spoiler here...read the book* and somehow, Lucas and August's craziness are definitely made for each other. I liked their chemistry. I liked the way August courted Lucas, and how Lucas gave into his needs with August. Theirs is an instalove, and a crazy one, but it's one I got behind. They are suited for each other and Lucas within very nicely with August's family. I enjoyed the banter between the brothers and hell, I even enjoyed the bloodshed. After all, they are going out some bad people...lol.I will say there is some knife play between the MC's and if this is a trigger, you might want to skip it. The two men really communicate and genuinely like (love) each other, as much as a psychopath can.I really liked this one. It's a fun, fast-paced ride from start to finish. I can't wait until the next one!
4218816167	3.75 “That’s the sweetest thing anybody’s ever said to me after cutting off another man’s nipple.”Lucas is a Clairvoyant ex cop who was blacklisted and sent to an asylum after trying to prove an fbi agent is serial k!ller after touching him and seeing it . People think hes crazy but he’s definitely not. August is a misunderstood genius and of the mulvaneys who all were lethally trained by their foster dad to eliminate bad people from society. When he falls for Lucas and finds out that the serial k!ller is after him he simply will not have that. Tbh they’re the perfect match. This is 70% smut & 30% plot & Theres pretty much insta attraction but i still very much enjoyed this one.
6556908265	Yesss to unhinged genius autistic psycho + clairvoyant professor. The insane possessiveness keeps being on point, the support from Noah when August doesn't understand 'feelings', the love languages, the torture of evil dudes, Lucas taking care of August's dislike of screams with his airpods. I'm loving this series! I'm still wondering how I manage to keep a straight face at the gym while listening to these two fuck.I was hoping for August being tied up and dommed by Lucas, but the knife and blood play made up for it (a tiny little bit).
5019599821	It wasn’t as good as the first one but plot had the same thrilling high part. I loved it. Ps: at first I thought Thomas and Aiden gave me weird vibes (in the synopsis) but this book gave more information and I’m glad they don’t have Targaryen kinda relationship but just significant age gap. Aiden was already adult when he met Thomas. I’ll be sticking around for them and other brothers
4481974976	August Mulvaney is the psychopath I would definitely take home to Mamma!! *Ignore my issues*OK, I adored Adam & Noah so much, but August & Lucas are straight out of a Criminal Minds and The Big Bang Theory crossover, and I am completely here for it. "I just...like the way he smells. I look at him and I find myself wondering what his skin tastes like." "Oof. Easy Dahmer," Adam said. "Maybe don't start with that." August is not just walking the line between genius and madness he is the line. Brilliant professor by day and an obsessive killer by night he is what nightmares are made of. He is very clear on his boundaries and how to make his life easier by shutting out the world when things get to be too intense. It isn't until Lucas Blackwell literally runs into him that August's true obsession begins. Lucas Blackwell was the golden boy of the FBI until his all too unreal abilities caught a killer, a killer who was also an FBI agent. After a brief stay in a mental institution and being relieved of his duties with the FBI Lucas is off to catch the killer that no one believed in. Now a professor he is trying to make it through this new reality when he runs into a psychopath who is nothing like the men he is used to encountering. Can this psychic and psycho catch a killer while one of them is obsessed with consuming the other and one is terrified of falling for a man like the ones he used to put away? "Yeah, but you've got me and I'm the monster other monsters fear." There was absolutely nothing I didn't completely love about Psycho. A quirky murderer and the FBI agent he falls for?? Come on!! That is a beautiful disaster waiting to happen and I devoured every single page of it. The Mulvaney's are much more than they seem, and I can't wait to completely consume this entire series.Also, please tell me I am not the only one completely shipping Thomas & Aiden?? *DROOL*
4095566198	~3.5Highly enjoyable, totally unbelievable.Loved August and the rest of his crazy family, Lucas was kind of plain, I wish there was more about his backstory and more use of his talent (outside of the current case).Knife/blood play is not my thing and, IMO, it didn't fit the characters. Luckily only one scene like this, hopefully the author won't go there with future books.The book is well paced and I was engaged from start to finish despite insta love and totally unbelievable plot. The later two seem to be a constant for Onley James books so you need to have your fiction shades ready going in 😎. But once you suspend your disbelief - the story is highly enjoyable and filled with adorable psychos.Looking forward to Moonstruck and the rest of Mulvaney brothers' books so rounded up
4222762763	yes, i had a horrible week of reading. as with other books by james/in this series, i truly tried my best to suspend my disbelief but there were extremely problematic and upsetting elements here that i can't ignore. this is long and contains the same TWs as the book in addition to mention of MMIGW.this book is blatantly ableist with zero nuance. examples: portrayal of schizophrenic person as abusive/incredibly neglectful; cherry-picking autistic traits to explain August's 'aloofness' or lack of caring and saying he has Asperger's (which is somehow every author's favorite diagnosis, did yall know Asperger was a eugenist?); August being literally "supernaturally smart" with an IQ at 160-whatever and ALSO explaining that with Asperger's. I'm not saying autistic people on the spectrum aren't often incredibly intelligent–but this portrayal, combined with a thoughtless mix of PTSD (only mentioned 1 time), psychopathy (lol), August literally being a serial murderer is... Not Good Representation. it's dehumanizing. it's giving the same trope of "high functioning" autistic people who are the "right kind of autistic" for neurptyical consumption.which can be argued–james isn't trying to represent autistic people. have yall read her A/N? apparently this is a coping method bc she worked at psych ward for children before as a nurse. what am i supposed to think about that piece of information? because inadvertently it makes me want to give her credibility as a medical professional which has not actually been displayed in this story. is there not some amount of responsibility that comes with writing characters like this with pseudo-facts presented as science? one of the more horrible parts of this book was the inclusion of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women & Girls as a storyline–the serial killer was taking "women no one cared about" and staging them for t*rture p*rn. once again, you could say, hey! isn't any discussion about this issue a net positive? and i will respond: the vibe of this was gratuitous. it made me sick to read about, and considering the conversations we're having in particular in Canada/US about the ongoing *injustice* and violence against Indigenous people, this book, which is supposedly "not to be taken seriously", should not have used MMIWG in the plot this way. certainly not with an all white group of "psychopaths" exacting revenge on their behalf, where said "psychopaths" do not actually care about justice, but only about killing. we hear nothing about where these women ended up or if their communities were contacted. i literally could not believe that this was included as a plot device dealt with in such an insensitive and irresponsible manner.i say psychopath in quotes because James also made the choice to have the Father adopt August when he was FOUR YEARS OLD. August, who has been under extreme neglect for 2 years, is given multiple diagnoses and then said to be irredeemable and destined to grow up to be a serial killer because he's already a psychopath. and also, he's a genius who by himself has read like, whatever random philosophy books while he was shut inside a dark room with a bucket. i hope yall can see why this is incredibly harmful, but if you can't: 1) the portrayal of a trauma as a thing that 100% leads to you being a psycho/sociopath 2) a 4 year old TODDLER being diagnosed/predestined as a psychopath (not a real diagnosis) 3) the only solution is being adopted by this creep who wants to experiment with children other comparatively mild (?) things that were annoying to me: repetitive quotes about how August can't love because of his Condition (Gee, I wonder if that stigmatizes autism and mental illness!); the family interactions/corny dialogue; Lucas literally having real psychic visions (is this a paranormal romance?); the inaccurate descriptions of academics/professors. plot was predictable (as soon as i read about the barista girl i was like oh ok lol) but i read AH so yall know idc about that if the book isn't ass. all i ask is for everyone to do responsible reading and look into all of these issues themselves. writing MM romance doesn't mean you include whatever you want without moral discernment or systemic considerations.
4392138782	Is it just me or did the book seem exactly same as the first one except for the beginning and a few changes😶. Also that seemed like a pretty normal relationship to me except one of them takes possessive to a new level and is very socially inept. Still, I liked the first book way more.And OMFG the comparison to Harry Potter😭😭😭almost ruined it for me forever. Thankfully there was only that one line.
6709083888	Seven psychopaths trained as vigilantes by their billionaire father shouldn’t work—but it does, and in the best way. Onley James’s writing is clever, funny, and action-packed. Making psychopaths feel wholesome is an art, and James does it better than almost anyone.The world is so easy to sink into, with lovable characters like August and Lucas, who balance each other perfectly. In all its absurdity, there’s something beautiful about finding the one person who quiets the noisiest parts of yourself.If you’ve ever wished your favorite crime procedural were gayer and had more spice, this might just be the series for you.
4113282909	"The psycho and the psychic. We're truly not fit for anybody but each other."This Mulvaney family is so cray cray and I love it. And I'm definitely shipping Aiden and Daddy Thomas.
4873925910	3.75 ⭐️ story🎧 4⭐️I actually enjoyed this one than the first book. August is kinda creepy dude! But he was also sweet and very possesive. This was kinda instalove but I think the author executed it really well! I dnf the first book because I’m expecting a lot from this author. But then I realized I only read one book from her so I don’t really know her style. A bookstagram friend told me that O.J books require some suspension of disbelief. Like most books with a psychology base, they have some accuracy with some creative liberties taken. She said its a typical onley james book.But if I can do that, maybe I could enjoy these series.And I did!Among other things, when we say a book is about psychopath we all expected it to be brutal, chaotic with a lot of blood bath! ( I know I did)But remember, there psychos were trained since their formative years. Their father drilled them into becoming more humane. Or atleast act like it. They live like ordinary excellent humans, they act like humans. They slipped here and there but you can see that what their father thought them was ingrave in their soul. And they love in a way that was possesive and sweet. Maybe thats typical Onley James type.I wish the sex a hotter though. I expected it to be more kinky or a bit brutal..because I think that’s the way the authors builds the characters up.
4207395995	Onley James fans don't need to be sold on this book. You'll be one-clicking regardless of what I put in this review. So this is aimed at those who are drawn in by the cover and blurb, both of which are on point. First - go read Unhinged. It sets up the Necessary Evils series, and while each book follows a different character, the Mulvaney family is prominently featured throughout. You'll be glad you did. Second - if gratuitous violence and psychopathic vigilantes upset you, this may not be the series for you - but it may be, because Onley treats these serious subjects so matter-of-factly that, for me anyway, they don't feel as graphic as they actually are, and it's rather refreshing, I think, to have characters who are actually, clearly, emphatically psychopaths, rather than being manipulative assholes. Psycho is as dark as Unhinged, though it has plenty of humor and snark, and the added excitement of Lucas, one the MCs, having paranormal abilities. Onley is known for bringing the heat, but she's outdone herself in this pairing. On a scale of 1-10, it's about a 25, in my opinion. I can't wait to read the rest of this unapologetically twisted series. Fortunately, Onley writes fast!
6974862136	4.5/5⭐️ 4/5🌶️ ——• 🖤I froth over a psychopath who can’t feel anything but does everything they can to love their person in their own way 🥵August and Lucas 🫶🏼”Now, tell me you love me.” August didn’t hesitate. “I love you.” Who was to say what love was to them? Maybe love to them was fighting and fucking and watching reruns of shows they didn’t like just because the other person did. Maybe love was Lucas letting August have the last slice of cheesecake or August always making sure Lucas took his meds and saw his therapist. Nobody got to dictate what their love looked like. So, when Lucas needed the words, August gave them freely.”🥹🥹This book was absolutely hilarious with August being so openly blunt, they honestly made the best freaking couple!!The storyline was good and easy to follow but the ending was a little vanilla, especially when we are dealing with these men. Despite that, it was a great read👏🏼
4505071304	Wow I was cringing so much. ☹️ I hope book 3 is better.
4700430683	I am very pleasantly surprised with this series! The humor is what gets me every time! I love how the family interacts with eachother, and who has never wanted someone entirely devoted to them who would burn the world down for them without a shred of remorse? Hypothetically speaking of course! I definitely think the 'signifi ant others' should form a support group or have a group chat for themselves!
5495529318	This review may contain spoilers, so fair warning, upon reading the review. Introduction Psycho is the second book in the Necessary Evils series. I absolutely couldn't put this one down at all!!! There is something about this author's writing that immediately pulls me into the story. These books are stalker romances, or at least that is the vibe that I am receiving so far. We shall see what the other books in the series are actually about. But so far it definitely has a strong stalker vibe. I would say that if you want to try out dark romance but one series that has plenty of humor, then these books are what you need to pick up and soon. I absolutely adored Psycho, maybe more than book one?? I am not sure which one so far I love more. But these two were so interesting and I really liked how the assassin was the sub in the bedroom, but not always so that was interesting. I also love that these are MM romances. Summary The story sets of with our brother "August" who is the genius of the brothers as he has the highest IQ but is also autistic. Then we have our other protoganist, who is a brilliant professor but also ex-FBI agent, Lucas who also happens to be on the run. August is determined to have Lucas and he knows that he is it for him. He doesn't understand what love is, but he understands he wants to keep Lucas for himself. At first its because Lucas is "Pretty" but August wants to get to the hidden layers. Lucas knows that he is in danger, and tries to put August off at first, because he knows he probably doesn't have long, but August will protect him no matter what...My Outlook This book was EVERYTHING! I absolutely adored it in so many ways. I think what I really enjoyed the most was seeing how this author implemented this here. I just loved this dynamic that we have in this one. And there is also some great BDSM being portrayed, August, I wouldn't say is a strict sub, probably closer to a switch when the situation calls for it. Its more to protect his partner than anything else but that scene when Lucas forces him to be his true self in the bedroom (SMOKIN and Brilliantly written) I think what draws me so easily into these books is the humor and charm with the mix of darker elements. Honestly normally Stalkers are fun to read but I can really see the appeal of these books and why so many readers have loved these so much!!! Because I am hooked on everything that combines these. Now I do want to warn those that haven't read much dark romance or don't like torture scenes, skip these scenes if gore details bother you. I just skim over these because torture stuff isn't always my thing lol but Onley James writes it well and what I love the most is that the couple in the book does it together as a team and its not just the one that does it all the time. My only complaint which didn't even affect my rating is the ending felt a bit rushed in comparison to the end of the first book. Overall View I found Psycho to be a brilliant story that captivated me from beginning to end and I am addicted to these and can't wait to delve deeper into the series!

4265965102	‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾☆ 3 stars ☆☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙ “The psycho and the psychic. We’re truly not fit for anybody but each other.” I absolutely adore the Mulvaney family. I didn’t like this one as much as the first, but I appreciated the torture scenes we didn’t get last book 💗I’m getting why these books are insta love. The Mulvaney brothers are psychopaths, therefore they don’t feel love and they become obsessed with their partners. Here Lucas resisted a bit more at the beginning at being insta love, but then realized there was no point. August was a total puppy in the beginning. And then he was sweet and then he was just fcking hot, and then romantic and ughhh I just loved him very much. The conflict was too fast for my liking. I knew they were gonna take her and I liked the planning, but the execution part was too damn fast!!! it felt anticlimactic. These books are hot, though. I love the balance between the sweet and the steaminess❤️‍🔥And I just wanna say, get you a man that can be sweet, horny and romantic while torturing and cutting another man’s nipple🥰🥰p.s. THE.

8052848419	Ця серія така миленька😄 не зважаючи на те, що вони всі вбивці і мають багато психічних порушень. Чомусь мені таки перша більше сподобалось, ця теж непогана але мені було скучно. Мені подобається як авторка швидко все розвиває, я вже думала там тижні пройшли а тут тільки 2-3 дні виявляється. Август діяв дуже швидко, сподобався Лукас, забираєм😄😄 Лукас навіть не мав права голосу. Але він таки правду казав якби до нього прийшов клієнт то він би сказав тікати з цих стосунків але якщо це стосується його і Августа тоді все добре😄😄❤️Август виявляється дуже миленький, читати книжки щоб зрозуміти Лукаса😍 ну це вааау, як він старався його зрозуміти, що він відчуває і питати Ноа поради 😍 ну такий вже хорошенький. Він тут в цій книзі класно розкрився. А Лукас мене дуже не вразив, хоча в нього такий класний дар.Так то книга дуже легка, швидко читається,хоча мені здалась скучноватою.
4591253452	Lucas laughed softly. “The psycho and the psychic. We’re truly not fit for anybody but each other. We’re stuck together.” August kissed his forehead. “That suits me just fine.” It really wasn't the book, it was me who couldn't get comfortable with it. My fault, I know..."Necessary Evils" is a mm romance series that follows a bunch of psychopaths. So, of course I knew it was bound to be dark before going into the book. And ot was. It was extremely dark, gore, triggering and uncomfortable. Normally very few things can work as triggers for me. But I haven't been in the right mind space for a while now. My mental health is not well, I have become really sensitive now a days. I don't why I still picked up this book. The dark, gore and disturbing themes made me super uncomfortable. I was feeling nauseated while reading the torture scenes (which were very descriptive btw). At the end, I skimmed those pages to save my sanity....
6782342757	oh august. i love him.
4161559570	It was fun, just like book 1. REALLY not a fan of the covers tho!I do like this one better than book 1. August is a dear. Not sure I care to read about Atticus next. The one I really want to read is about Thomas himself. Let's get some age-gap MM going!! And maybe Aiden. Don't care about the twins...
5544908874	☆ «Quizás el amor era que Lucas dejara que August se comiera la última rebanada de tarta de queso o que August siempre se asegurara de que Lucas tomara sus medicamentos y viera a su terapeuta. Tal vez el amor para ellos era pelear y follar y ver reposiciones de programas que no les gustaban solo porque a la otra persona le gustaba. Nadie pudo dictar cómo era su amor. Así que, cuando ambos se decían que se amaban no dudaban el uno del otro.»☆ En esta historia tenemos a August y a Lucas, ambos son maestros de una universidad, ambos esconden secretos y ambos se encuentran el uno al otro cuando más lo necesitaban. Lucas tiene el don de poder ver todo en la mente de las personas con solo tocarlas y al encontrarse por primera vez con August descubre que el sexi profesor es algo más que un académico; por supuesto que August en cuando pone sus ojos sobre Lucas se obsesiona con él, estando dispuesto a protegerlo y que todos sepan que ahora pertenece a August Mulvaney.☆ Una de las cosas que más me gustan de estos libros es que los hermanos psicopatas no solo matan porque si, sino que tienen un propósito y es eliminar a la basura de la sociedad, lo que el sistema de justicia no logra o no quiere tomar en sus propias manos, entonces ahí entran nuestros chicos. Aquí tenemos que ir descubriendo poco a poco los crímenes cometidos por un asesino en serie en contra de mujeres de las comunidades indígenas o barrios pobres, así como averiguar quién es y en donde se encuentra para poder aplicar la ley y justicia al estilo Mulvaney. Desde el principio nos dicen que uno de los culpables es un ex compañero de trabajo en el FBI de Lucas, pero lo que no esperan es encontrarse con toda una red de tortura por pedido de ciertas personas en la dark web.☆ A la par que se desarrollan y encajan las piezas del rompecabezas vemos como ambos protagonistas se van acercando y conociendo más poco a poco, tenemos harto sexo caliente y la presentación de Lucas como nuevo integrante a la familia Mulvaney, que siempre es divertido y entretenido estar con toda la manada de nuestros psicopatas. Me encanta que, aunque August este diagnósticado con autismo, con Lucas siempre se siente cómodo y no usa sus habituales audífonos porque le importa e interesa cada una de las palabras que salen de él, es sumamente inteligente y haría cualquier cosa por proteger a su hombre. Por su parte, Lucas también demuestra que se enamora completamente y que no importa lo que la sociedad diga acerca de lo que es el amor, sabe que cuando August le dice que lo ama, lo dice en serio.☆ Como siempre hay cosas que no me gustaron y es que la historia es muy lenta, se siente que es más sexo y poca trama, además de que en realidad no había gran misterio; el hecho de que ambos protagonistas decidan estar juntos desde las primeras páginas como si fuera un instalove también me desanimo un poco ya que no hay cabida para una construcción de la relación entre ambos sino que pasan directo a ser el todo del otro y no es muy mi estilo.
5454986198	A Bit Disappointed Storyline💥💥💥Character Development 🌻🌻🌻🌻Angst Level😰😰😰Chemistry🧪🧪🧪Steam 🥵🥵🥵Humor🤣🤣🤣🤣Overall⭐️⭐️⭐️Ugggh…I expected a bit more from this book. I really hate to give this a 3 star rating. While I still enjoyed this one, I didn’t enjoy it as Adam and Noah’s story. I found this story to follow the same formula as book 1. Instalove, psychopath immediately smitten with man that has dealt with some form of trauma and imminent danger. I really wish the plot would have went in a different direction from the first book. This is a 7 book series, so I’m hoping things switch up or else it’s gonna be difficult to get through all 7 books. 😔I really loved August. For a “psychopath” I found him to be really sweet and actually insanely adorable. The lengths he took to show Lucas he was for him was super cute. I loved all of his quirks and weirdness. There was so much more to the scary psychopath that tunes the world out with his headphones and pop diva tunes. Lucas…I wasn’t a huge fan of. I felt that his character was pretty bland. Outside of his clairvoyancy, there wasn’t much to him. I just couldn’t connect with his character. I really feel like the intent for the story was clear. But the execution, not so much. August and Lucas both needing to shield themselves from the world to decrease sensory overload due to their gifts. I feel like their chemistry and connection was pretty bland and fell flat. I found myself skimming a tad bit at times. This wasn’t a bad book, I still found myself enjoying it. The Mulvaney family is so much fun to read about. I look forward to book 3.
4749390057	This series has quickly become one of my favorite of all time and my go to comfort rereads. I haven’t revisited Lucas and August since the first time I read the book, but they’re just as cute now as they were then. I love the hot professors with a secret dark life trope. I also love the autism rep with August’s overstimulation explored through his decor and love of headphones. Lucas is so sweet and I love the epilogue exploring his confidence which he regains after/through the events of the book. Not to mention the hot, kinky sex (the later books even more so)!
5018010335	4.5 Awesome!TPAM BR 10/9/22https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...ZL Sept 2022
4652545477	I feel like I blacked out for the first half of the book and the rest of it already predictable but I'm here for the possessiveness of the mc so the plot don't really matter to me.
4209695845	You know what's more endearing than forehead kisses? Forehead kisses from autistic psychopaths who cannot love you and are incapable of reading social cues and a lot of integral feelings, that's what!I didn't think it could get better than or be so different from Adam's book but I'm so glad I was wrong. August and Lucas were just so damn great together! "Have you ever just looked at someone or something and thought, I want to keep it? Like, I want to protect him from the outside world but, at the same time, his helplessness and fear are so...intoxicating? I want him to be soft just for me." Lucas was definitely not helpless and neither was he the delicate flower his psychometry and past would make him out to be. "You still kill people and I'm still crazy." The humor and the tender moments worked so well in this book. It did nothing to detract from the seriousness of the situation and, thank goodness, was not forced and did not make me cringe! "Dating while psychic has too many pitfalls." "Dating while psycho comes with similar issues." These two had such amazing chemistry and despite the dark circumstances, the romance was just so knee-weakeningly good. For a psychopath, August was just so romantic and attentive and attuned to Lucas in a way that would make you question whether or not dating regular, non-psychopaths is even worth it. "This man had just said he was going to marry him like it was a foregone conclusion and it didn't scare him. It just made him...horny." Clearly I need to consult the DSM-V because I was too invested in this book and I may have enjoyed the crazy a little too much because I was definitely cheering on a family of psychopathic killers and their criminal counterparts. But it was too good! "The man was a dozen different people all rolled into one sexy, brainy package and Lucas' psychotherapist heart was there for it." I mean, what do you say to that except for, samesies? Because if a criminal with psychological issues were ever to corrupt a criminologist/psychotherapist/Criminal profiler/Ex FBI agent- it would be the gifted, sexy Professor August!I can hardly wait for the rest of the brothers' books because that preview of Atticus' story already has me sooo excited to get to know Jericho! And of course, Aiden has to explain why he's mad at Thomas...I mean, adopted at 17? Refuses to call him dad? Is angry and a little rebellious? Refuses to live at/close to home? Yes, if Onley is thinking of pairing Aiden x Thomas, I don't know if my morally gray spirit will mind👀
4233601002	August is the BEST psychopath! *****Rating: 5 starsSteam: 3 flamesGenre: MM / Dark / BDSMTriggers: YES*****And the psychopaths are back with a new mission and this one could put their entire organization at risk. August, a child genius with an eidetic memory, survives through reading, music, and killing. His day job as a renowned physics professor is going to put him directly in the path of Lucas Blackwell.Lucas, a former FBI agent, has been disgraced and hospitalized for his crazy ramblings about a fellow FBI agent being a serial killer. The reason he was locked away was he garnered this idea about the FBI Agent/serial killer, by touching the killer. You see, Lucas is clairvoyant although everyone thinks he is crazy. One day, August and Lucas bump into each other, and when August reaches for Lucas to help him up, Lucas see’s August for who he truly is, a murderer and now August has a problem. Someone knows his secret. Can he convince Lucas that everything is not always black and white? Or will Lucas find a way to bring him and his brothers to justice. I am going to be honest, I was cracking up during the first half of the book. August’s interactions with Lucas are so innocent and childlike for a murdering psychopath. When August doesn’t understand a problem, he reads a book. Now he is reading books on relationships and love languages in hopes he can woo Lucas. Yep, August has his sights set on Lucas now…and once these psychopaths lock onto a target, be it for a kill or romance, there is nothing that will stop them. This second book in the series is fast-paced, dark, deviant, depraved, and absolutely PERFECT! I loved August and Lucas’ road to revenge and romance. Getting to see Noah, Adam and the other brothers was a bonus, but August totally stole my depraved little heart. Once again their are triggers, references to human trafficking, rape, and murder. But, as with Unhinged, everyone will get exactly what they deserve in this book. I am totally looking forward to the next book in the series and will happily be reading all seven brothers stories! Atticus falls next and that is sure to be one heck of a ride. A definite recommendation from me! *** note: don’t forget to read the bonus epilogue. The link is at the end of the book. OMG! I was swooning hard.
6903378499	Rating: 4.90/5Spice: 3/5Another win in the series! Before this book, I never would’ve thought psychopaths could be so sweet and caring. 😚“Well, why did you answer the phone in the first place?” “Because it was you,” August said, as if the answer was obvious. “When your significant other calls, you answer.”When a psychopath has more emotional intelligence than your ex 😒😑I loved August and Lucas and their chemistry was great. Lucas’s clairvoyance brought a cool twist to their relationship and the whole story. And I was way more invested in the mystery and plot than in book 1.My only gripe is that I wish there had been more scenes with August submitting and the knife play. That’s what we were promised from the start, and I was pretty bummed when it didn’t happen. 😩 So, even though I want to give it 5 stars, I can’t. Overall, though, I really loved this one!Tropes/TriggersPsycho x psychic Possessive McKnife playFound family Family of vigilantes Mention of SA and torture of women
4410021191	I don’t know what Onley James has done to me, but I am a fully formed recruit to Dark Romance! You can give me a psychopathic killer who can’t show emotion, has a knife kink, and wants nothing more than to take care of his wounded bird of a love interest ANY DAY!!!August is described as being a sexier version of Daniel Radcliffe and I could NOT stop imagining him all covered in tattoos. Like…. Sexy much?!? Ideal man… maybe?!? I love how each of the brothers are giving me different forms of psycho, but are still cuddly bears, just without the emotional capacity to fall in actual love, while also still forming attachments. Why is that so hot to me?😂 Oh! And he’s also a Professor! 🤤🤤🤤Lucas is a former FBI agent, who also happens to have psychometry. They call him clairvoyant, but he can sense emotions or memories of the person who last touched an object. He saw something he shouldn’t have and when he tried to report it, he was sent to a 72 hour hold. Now he has a dangerous “stalker” and it isn’t even the psychotic sexy professor.I am loving these books and I can NOT wait to read the next one!!!!!!!!! 😍
4121331365	Amazing I was so looking forward to this book! And let me tell you, it did not disappoint! It actually blew all my expectations. IT WAS BETTER! We hace August, our genius psycho, and Lucas, our clairvoyant running from a monster. They were literally made to be together, there’s no other option. The steamy scenes were SPECTACULAR. Jesus, one of the hottest books of the year. Can’t wait for book 3!
4207053629	dark but also… funny?This series is so compelling. I couldn’t put either of the first two books down, and I’ve already preordered the third, because they’re just that good. I don’t know how the author manages to make an actual psychopath so endearing, but she does. There’s lots of heat and humor along with some of the darker moments dealing with bad guys. It might not be for everyone, but I’m sure here for it!
4232600556	5 Stars - Dark RomanceAugust is such an intriguing character and I thought it would be repetitive since all the characters in this series are psychopaths but they are all uniquely different.
5770800570	Psycho is the second instalment in Onley James's addictive Necessary Evils series. This book features August and Lucas, and overlaps with the epilogue of the first book, Unhinged. I think you technically could read these books as standalones, but there is interconnecting elements and a seemingly overarching storyline so I recommend starting from the first book and going in order!August Mulvaney is exceptional, and that's saying something in a family of psychopaths. By day, he's a brilliant professor that his students love but confuses his colleagues. By night, he's a ruthless, obsessive killer that helps right the wrongs of a failing justice system. Lucas Blackwell is restarting his life after a horrifying end to his career as an FBI agent where he used his gift of clairvoyance and profiling to put away criminals. After literally running into Professor Mulvaney, Lucas knows something's not quite right. It seems Lucas knows August's secret, and he also wants Lucas all to himself. This could go very poorly. Or maybe Lucas and August are everything they didn't realize they needed from one another. "August knew he wasn't explaining himself right. But he didn't know how to say he wanted to be the one who put Lucas together and took him apart. The one who could make him beg but also made him feel safe."This family of psychopaths really worms their way into your heart and live rent-free in your mind, with no complaints of course! Similarly to the first book (Adam and Noah), I had my concerns for Lucas going in. The characters also reference that August has autism on top of his psychopathy and attachment disorders, which makes his lack of social etiquette even clearer. Once again, this book shows that love looks how you want it to, and everyone else be damned. I love that and how the concept comes together for Lucas and August in their epilogue (and definitely ensure you check out the extended epilogue). I wasn't sure what to think when I read that Lucas has clairvoyant abilities, but I was so invested in how he used them throughout the book, and more importantly how August and his family accepted these talents. Lucas is his own version of broken and scared when we meet him, and August turns out to be just as protective and possessive as his brother was with Noah. Speaking of which, I lived for all the different glimpses we got of Adam and Noah in Psycho, and I'm looking forward to getting to experience all the couples from different viewpoints as the series continues! Onley James has such a unique way of blending storytelling with their psychiatric nursing experience, and throwing in some dark humor and hot as hell encounters! Can't wait for Atticus and Jericho!"Lucas's face went soft, his smile radiant. "That's the sweetest thing anybody's ever said to me after cutting off another man's nipple.""
4453726628	Well, my love for this series continues with August & Lucas. When I reviewed UNHINGED, I suggested reading this series if you're into the TV series, DEXTER. That's because the series follows adopted brothers who are all deemed sociopaths. Their father teaches believes their difficulty feeling emotion allows them to be vigilante-style killers, ridding society of the worst kind of people. Hence the series is named, NECESSARY EVILS. I devoured Book 1 & quickly started Book 2. PSYCHO has more of a CRIMINAL MINDS feel, with our very own Garcia/Calliope. Lucas is a former FBI agent & has the ability to sense emotions/relive the past through objects through clairvoyance. August is brilliant and instantly attracted to Lucas. Too bad they bump into each other and Lucas immediately knows August's secret - he's a stone-cold killer. Lucas is convinced another FBI agent is responsible for the disappearance of women and if he can trust him, August may be the perfect person to help.What to expect from reading Psycho by Onley James:Male /Male romanceLots of on the page sex scenesDark humor that makes me laugh out loudSuspense, tension and criminalsA dysfunctional and lovable family with sociopathsSultry love story
7596930085	4,0 💫 | Maldigo a mi yo del pasado por haberse saltado este libro wtf. Me encantó 💖💖💖. Como siempre, este libro fue igual de adictivo, entretenido y spicy qué todos los demás en la serie, cosa que amo. Onley James nunca cambies 🤌. Honestamente no creí que fuera a leerlos alguna vez, pero ahora que leí el segundo libro de la serie Jericho's Boys donde hubo una interacción entre August y Lucas me entraron muchísimas ganas de conocerlos jajaja.No esperaba que me gustaran tanto, pero acaban de entrar a mi top 2. Obvio que mis favs son Jericho y Atticus por lo que usaré este lectura de excusa he iré a releerlos 🤭.La escena extra fue verdaderamente DULCE, me encantó. Y lo de los audífonos so cuteeee 🤧💕.Ranking de Mulvaney:◽Atticus ◽August◽Archer ◽Adam◽ThomasRanking de sus chikistrikis:◽Jericho◽Mack◽Lucas◽Aiden◽Noah (tqm no te ofensas) (no leí a los gemelos y no pienso hacerlo. Los dejaré como personajes secundarios que me provocan mucha gracia y todos felices como perdices).

I wasn’t the biggest fan of Adam and Noah, but catching glimpses of this little freak kept me excited enough to finish the book. But this? This was so much fun. I fell even more in love with August, and never found myself wishing that things would just hurry along. It’s cute. Quirky. Dark and deadly. I really just had such a grand time.
