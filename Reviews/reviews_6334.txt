9773150	** spoiler alert ** It is a pity that people are told this is a science fiction book before they read it. I feel the least interesting thing about it is that it is science fiction. I mean this in much the same way that the least interesting thing one could say about 1984 is that it is science fiction. As a piece of literature I enjoyed it much more than Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake and even more than Huxley's Brave New World. The themes that make this book most interesting are to do with the social alienation of groups of people on the basis of inherited genetic characteristics. In fact, as a critique of racism this book is utterly brilliant. Those being racially alienated are genetically identical (they are in fact clones) to those attacking them.Plato believed those 'in the know' should tell lies to those 'who do not know' so as to protect them from the all too horrible truths about life. I have always hated this aspect of Plato, always finding it grotesque and frightening in its implications. Those implications are drawn out in all their disturbing horror here. This book has much to say about the nature of 'illness' and how those inflicted with an 'illness' use the scars of that illness as the badges of truly belonging to the group. So that those 'less advanced' in the ravages of the illness don't really know or really belong to the group. As a portrait of victims adopting to being victims it says much about us as humans - thoughtful readers may find it says far too much. I write this on World Aids Day.Ishiguro writes the most nightmarish novels I've ever read. In others, such as The Unconsoled or When We Were Orphans the nightmare feeling is due to the dreamlike oddity of the interconnection of events in the story. One reads these books in much the same way that one wakes from a disturbing dream, with feelings of disorientation and anxiety. Even though this is the most literal 'nightmare book' of his I have read - the world he creates being literally a nightmare, and made all the worse by being set in the recent past - it is a book totally lacking in that strange dreamlike quality so characteristic of these other novels. In this sense it seemed less of a nightmare than these others. If you struggled with these, you will not struggle with this in quite the same way.He also has fascinating and quite painful things to say about the nature of love and how love has a proper time, a time that may be lost or missed. As someone who has loved, lost and missed I found this particularly challenging. The relationship between sex and love and illness is perhaps something people may find simply too much - not because this is handled in any way that is too explicit, but because I do believe we like to think that sex, as a manifestation of love, has curative and redemptive powers. A book that questions this, questions something we hold very dear and some readers may find this too much to ask.This is also a book about betrayal. The betrayals we commit against those we love the most and yet that we barely can understand or explain after we have committed them - these are constant throughout the book. He is a writer all too aware of the human condition. The scene which gives the book its title is a wonderful example of the near impossibility of our being understood by others and yet our endless desire for just such an understanding.There is nothing easy about reading this book - although it is written in the simplest of prose. It has an honesty of feeling that brands one's soul.I loved this book and have thought about it a lot since I finished reading it and will think about it more. There is much more I would like to say, but there is no space. May we all be good carers before we complete.
125368951	Ah f**kin' British writers! My inclination to adore everyone from Evelyn Waugh to Charles Dickens, from Alex Garland to Zadie Smith seems very ingrained (VERY DEEP) inside me, primordial, & there must be SOME bloody reason why I find most English fiction so alluring. I think it has mostly to do with mood. It may linger deliciously...The best book I've read all year (though not including Graham Greene's "The Quiet American") is about a microsociety of students in a boarding school hybrid named Hailsham. While there they do rounds and rounds of arts and crafts and come of age together, grow up, & yet there is something so not right with their seclusion and it takes page upon page to discover why it is that they are there. It is horrific, it is bizarre, this secret is handled with so much craft that it is indeed this attribute that marks this outstanding (quite brutal) masterpiece apart from all others. There is an incredibly subtle mastery of several different genres here. Sci-fi meshes impeccably with allegory which is played out in the manner of a Gothic romance. Because the characters are trapped in all of this, the end result is (The Genre Supreme:) Tragedy. I feel so bad for Ruth, Tommy & especially for Kath, the wise but all-too-frail narrator, but at least their petition, which is the book's title, is true. This one is now on the list of all those I cannot let go or do without.
4016324714	I just...don't know how you take a book with a plotline as interesting and creepy and unique as this one and turn it into an unrelenting snoozefest, party of one.When I hear "the best novel of the decade," I expect brilliance.When I hear "now a major motion picture starring Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, and Keira Knightley," I expect excitement.When I hear "millions of copies sold, presumably, based on the number of Goodreads ratings there are," I expect memorable characters or writing or storytelling or SOMETHING.But I got nothing.I've put off writing this review for a month, which is kind of but not super unusual for me admittedly, because I do not remember a thing about it.And not really because I have forgotten the whole thing, but more because...well, what's to remember?Bottom line: If anyone is looking for a nice little one way getaway to snoozeville, I have the book for you!------------pre-reviewyes, the ending of this made me sad, but at the same time and in a much more pressing way this is maybe one of the most boring books i've ever read.review to come / 2ish stars------------tbr reviewi will read:1) every book that is called the best of the decade2) every book that was then adapted into a movie starring carey mulligan OR keira knightley OR andrew garfield that i can watch.so basically i'm reading this 4 times over.
13251321	It's very important, if you're intending to read this book, that you don't read any reviews or listen to any talk about it first. I had no idea what this book was about before I read it - and the blurb gives you a very different impression, actually - and so I slipped easily into a story that was as engrossing as it was revealing.If you know something about what to expect, though, I don't think you'll enjoy it nearly as much. It's a bit like an art installation that requires audience participation: you have to do your bit, too, to make it work, so it makes sense, so it tells the story it was meant to tell. Keep yourself in the dark, that's my advice. Because of this, there's no point in writing an actual review.
6205758440	this book was not AT ALL what i expected. from a writing standpoint, this is easily 5 stars. but overall, the story left something to be desired. i also didn’t find this to be as devastating as most people say it is. it’s objectively a sad story, but to me it was more disturbing than anything else.no one who recommends this book ever says what it’s actually about (also i rarely read synopses), so i had no idea that this is speculative fiction and not literary fiction. so to say that i was shocked when i got to some of the more sci-fi elements would be an understatement loll
150958569	DIALOGUE:Imagine a restaurant, London, mid-2003.Publisher: Hey, K, we need another novel and we need it quick.K: I know, I know.Publisher: Another “Remains of the Day”. Something Hollywood can turn into a hit.K: I’m working on it.Publisher: Any ideas?K: Well, I’ve been reading some Jonathan Swift.Publisher: Who?K: You know, “Gulliver’s Travels”.Publisher: Oh, yeah, Jack Black. It's in pre-production.K: Well, he had a modest proposal about how to stop the children of the poor being a burden…Publisher: I’m with you, yep, delinquents, sounds good.K: …he wanted to stop them being a burden to their parents…Publisher: Yep, with you.K: … and the Country.Publisher: Yep, a Thatcherite angle, I think it’s Maggie’s time again.K: Anyway, he had this idea that you could kill two birds with one stone…you could end the kids’ misery and the poverty of their parents at the same time…Publisher: Let me guess, you could eat them, ha ha.K: You’ve read it?Publisher: No… wait, you’re kidding me, aren’t you?K: No, that’s the whole point of the story.Publisher: What, eat your kids?K: No, not your own kids, other people’s kids.Publisher: How could anyone do it?K: He goes into that… stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled…Publisher: Yuck.K: He even talks about making them into a fricassee or a ragout.Publisher: It’s a bit out there, K.K: I was thinking of updating it a bit.Publisher: How would you do that?K: I was thinking I could tell the story from the point of view of a midwife who…Publisher: Someone who has to care for the kids?K: Yeah, until they turn 12 months or something...Publisher: Let me guess, then she hands them over to a child butcher or something?K: Yeah.Publisher: Look, I can see where you’re going with this, but it all sounds a bit grotesque.K: That’s the whole point. It’s an allegory for our times.Publisher: I just don’t know whether it’s got legs.K: Legs? You’re kidding me…it’s got every damned limb and organ you can think of.Publisher: I don’t want to think of it, I can just imagine the reviews. They’ll call it “The Remains of the Meat Tray”.K: Ha, I hadn’t thought of that, I was going to call it “The Remains of the Creche”.Publisher: It gets worse.K: No, honestly, I was thinking of “Never Let Me Grow”.Publisher: You mean, like…never let me grow up?K: Yeah.Publisher: Do you think you could turn the people into pigs or something, you know, like “Animal Farm”?K: I was sort of hooked on the idea of using people and narrating the story in a really dead pan voice…Publisher: I don’t know about dead pan, it sounds more frying pan to me.K: …If it’s dead pan, people won’t be able to tell whether it’s set in the future or the present. They won’t know how close to reality it is.Publisher: I just don’t know what I think about this eating babies stuff.K: But it’s like sci-fi, you can do anything in sci-fi.Publisher: Look, if we let you do this, they won’t be calling it sci-fi, they’ll be calling it sci-fry.K: If you let me do it, I guarantee we’ll be able to get Helen Mirren to play the midwife.Publisher: Who?K: Helen Mirren, you know, the Queen.Publisher: No, no. Look, if you can tweak it, you know, think about my idea for a second, set it on Animal Farm, make it about cloning pigs, so they can grow body parts for other pigs or something…K: I know, put some wizard animals in it and call it “Hogparts”?Publisher: Come on take me seriously, K, just clone it up and tone it down.K: I’ll think about it.Publisher: I’ll see if I can get Keira Knightley to voice one of the pigs. K: She’s hot.Publisher: You could call it “Never Let Me Go”.K: What does that mean?Publisher: It’s a song my mother used to play. Jane Monheit sang it.K: I could get used to it. Don’t know what I think about the name Monheit though. Publisher: It does sound a bit German, doesn't it?K: What would you think if I called her something more English in the book.Publisher: Like Judy Bridgewater?K: Who’s Judy Bridgewater?Publisher: It’s my mother’s maiden name.K: Sounds good to me.Publisher: Look, I normally like to respect an artist’s integrity, but hey, you’re the artist, so I guess that makes it OK.K: Do you think I could get to meet Keira Knightley?Publisher: I think so… look I’ve been thinking about it, maybe it’s not such a good idea to turn Keira Knightley into a pig.K: Sometimes you can’t really see the depth of your own characters, until you can imagine who’s going to play them.Publisher: So, no pigs?K: No pigs. I don’t mind the cloning bit though.Original Review: April 16, 2011CRITIQUE:Some More Serious ThoughtsI wrote the above dialogue before I even finished the book.I wanted to read the book before seeing the film, which I will probably do in the next week or so during the holidays.When I wrote the dialogue, I probably had about 50 pages to finish, but the dialogue had taken shape in my head, and I didn't want to risk losing it.There might have been a chance that it would be superseded by my final thoughts on the novel itself.I had high expectations that I would finally get to appreciate the novel more when I had finished it and absorbed the denouement.Unfortunately, it left me feeling dissatisfied.Narrative StyleI didn't find the narrative style appropriate or convincing.It is told in the first person, by way of recollection of three different periods of Kathy's life.The periods are discussed chronologically, although during each period, there are occasional allusions to each other period.There is a lot of internal detail about each period, what was going on in Kathy's head.Dialogue between the characters is infrequent and sparse.The novel is overwhelmingly an interior monologue.Occasionally, there are lapses or flaws in Kathy's memory that she self-consciously draws attention to.Part of me wanted to say to the author, "It's your story, just get it right, you can remember anything you like, because you're making it up anyway."But then I guess we have to differentiate between Ishiguro and Kathy.We have to expect some flaws in the glass, rather than a word and memory perfect narrative.Still I was never really confident who Kathy was talking to, it wasn't just an interior monologue, there were occasional mentions of a "you", a second person to whom she was talking.If you had sat down to tell this story to someone else, I think you could or would have told the story far more succinctly and selectively.The detail and the repetition of environment, atmosphere and mood bulk up the painting, but they don't add to the depth.Each new layer of paint is superimposed on the previous layer, so that while there might be a lot of paint on the canvas, it is physically, rather then metaphorically, deep.The Geometry of LoveSPOILER ALERTWhile Kathy, Ruth and Tommy live in an horrific environment (perhaps a metaphorical equivalent to a concentration camp), the novel deals with the quality of their humanity under these circumstances.The guardians might have been trying to work out (incidentally) whether they had souls, but ultimately what we learn is that the positive aspects of human nature can survive or prevail despite the circumstances.It's interesting that the characters' quest for love initially seemed to be motivated by a belief that it would postpone their donations and prolong their lives.While this belief turns out to be mistaken, Kathy discovers that love is worth seeking in its own right, regardless of any consequences or notions of cause and effect.Ruth promoted the belief in the life prolonging effect of love.In effect, Kathy acquiesced in it and never deliberately interfered in or disrupted the relationship between Ruth and Tommy.However, when she comes to the end of the story, perhaps she realises that she should have been less acquiescent and let herself express her love for Tommy.So ultimately, "Never Let Me Go" is a love story, a triangular one at that.Life is short, you just have to get on with it, you have to take your (true?) love wherever you can find it, even if someone else gets hurt in the process.When we pair up in love, there is always a chance that someone will miss out or get hurt.Three into two won't go.Perhaps, this is actually calculus rather than geometry, but you know what I mean.
2109039608	I had this book on my TBR shelf for years without realizing that it was essentially dystopian science fiction.The main character is a woman in her early thirties reflecting back on her life as a child at a private school in England. Kids in the school grew up in an isolated but almost idyllic setting; not knowing their parents but realizing somehow they were “special.” After finishing school they live together in small groups in cottages before heading out into the world on their own. The story is set in the late 1990s.From the very first page we learn something is not right just from the language. We read that they have become “carers” and “donors;” their teachers are called “guardians” and they know there are people out there called their “possible.” We also learn they can have sex but are incapable of having children and that after their third of fourth “donation” they have “completed.” So we catch on pretty quickly what life has in store for these kids. There are some genuine mysteries though. Why does the school seem obsessed with encouraging them to do creative work, giving them awards and collecting the best work to go to a gallery that they never see? Where does it go and who sees it and why?Much of the plot is built around a three-way love story between a boy and two girls at school. One of the girls is the main character. All three are good friends but the boy and one of the girls are a couple. (view spoiler)[ The girl in the couple is controlling and domineering and prevents the relationship between her boyfriend and the other girl from developing. Later in life a romantic relationship develops between the other girl (the young woman who is our main character) and the now-young man. In fact she becomes his “carer.” Is the love they develop better than it would have been years ago? Or is it too late and stale? (hide spoiler)] This quote tells us about the title: “Because maybe, in a way, we didn’t leave it [the school] behind nearly as much as we might once have thought. Because somewhere underneath, a part of us stayed like that: fearful of the world around us, and – no matter how much we despised ourselves for it – unable quite to let each other go.” I thought it was a good story; it kept my attention all the way through, although not quite as good as the author’s best-known work, Remains of the Day.Top photo from englishcottagevacation.comThe author from newyorker.com [Revised, pictures added, spoiler hidden 12/31/22]["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
1904620912	The thing I enjoy most about Ishiguro’s writing is the sheer level of depth he gets into his characters; he captures all the intensity of real emotions whether they are self-serving or destructive. His writing style is simple, plain even, but he builds up many layers within his storytelling to unleash the full symphony of conflicted feelings in powerful bursts.However, I saw none of his brilliance here. Indeed, for all his talent, I don’t think this novel was as effective as The Remains of the Day or even When We Were Orphans. For me. this is a lesser novel by a great writer. This is his most popular work, and his most critically acclaimed, and I think that’s only because of the particular themes he explores here. This is science-fiction, but I prefer the term pseudo-science fiction. It’s slightly futuristic, but the fictional elements are relatively comparable to what man can do today. Vivisection transplant is nothing new. Organ donors are nothing new. This book is very similar to the movie “The Island” (2005) where a select group of people have special clones bred for the singular purpose of providing them with replacement body parts. What I find interesting is how these two were released so close together. For me, such forms of artifice reflect the worries and concerns of that decade. Discussions over designer babies and animal rights issues (in regards to testing, transplants and cloning) were often in the media. If we look back to the Victorians, the elements in the literature reflected the concerns of the age. This is true for all literary movements; I just used this one for an example, but the point is I think this novel reflects an aspect of the time in which it was written. And for me that’s why I think it’s worthy of study, it's timely. But did I enjoy it? Not overly. Do I think it is a success artistically and dramatically? Not really. For me the novel continuously fails to deliver. The retrospective narrative remains detached from the happenings. Granted, the voice has lost all sense of hope and is looking back at a life of sorrow and incompleteness, but it just didn’t have a sense of life. You could say that’s because she is semi-human in the state imposed on her, but, for me, it was too despairing. And that’s coming from someone who counts Edgar Allan Poe amongst his favourite authors. The inability of the characters to question the situation also somewhat puzzled me. Surely, they must have had some glimpses of thought that considered their present situation an injustice? There was a lack of inquisitiveness into the morality of the situation. And this, when paired with their complete failure of recognising their own feelings about each other, made the narrative feel slightly incomplete. They didn’t seem to look beyond their own situation. As a reader, we make our own judgement calls, but where were theirs? A certain emotional immaturity, that bordered on the absurd, ran through the work. Overall, I can see why this book is so popular. But I don’t think it’s all that. Ishiguro’s other books are much more accomplished.Facebook| Twitter| Insta| Academia
5506613347	Sometimes I don't choose a book but it chooses me. Sounds weird?In the beginning, I don't understand and was a bit confused by the words such as donor, and carer.I may say this book is a bit slow, boring, and mundane but it is growing interesting when you continue discovering it.The imaginative or sci-fiction story of Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth makes me reminisce about my life and I am grateful that we can live in a free world. Remember, we never take the "free world" for granted. We must protect it. Sorry, a little bit of politics here. 😁So, in short, "Never Let Me Go" is a poignant and heart-wrenching tale that will leave you in tears, but with a few laughs along the way to lighten the mood.By the way, don't forget to watch the movie too.
1730625444	You know those irritating people who talk to children and old people as if they were babies, in a puerile, singsong voice?Well, those idiots sprang to mind as I endured the narrative voice of this glacially slow yawnfest of a novel.This is a book so plodding, so dreary and so pretentious that I gave up on it halfway through.With a less-than-pleased harrumph, I shoved it into a slot on my bookshelf alongside The Remains of the Day, which I'd bought at the same time, anticipating dual sublimity. So for the past few years there they both sat, on the bookcase equivalent of a naughty step, sulking like teenagers and glaring at me each time I passed. "Oh, get over yourselves!" I berated, turning them around so that only their pages were on show. Ha! That taught them a lesson they'll never forget!But right now, I'm giving The Remains of the Day its day in the sun. It's highly spoken of by numerous Goodreaders, so I'm hoping that Ishiguro can belatedly turn my frown upside down.As for Never Let Me Go, the only thing that I have in common with its improbable story line is that (view spoiler)[I carry an organ donor card in my wallet, though mine are only due to be harvested after my death. (hide spoiler)] : )I remember someone describing this as being somewhere between Kafka and Enid Blyton, which is most apt.Read this book by all means, but don't say that I didn't warn you.UPDATE: The Remains of the Day was a triumph, in my view! : )
74435381	I'm always excited when I run across a novel that is, so far as I can tell, essentially perfect. Never Let Me Go is one of those. There is not a single thing wrong with this book. Ishiguro is a master craftsman and it shows here.The novel's characterizations are pitch perfect. Its narrative flow reveals things in exactly the right order. Mystery is preserved until it no longer matters and then, under the light of revelation, we discover the mystery was never the thing that mattered. Ishiguro plays with the reader as he unfolds his exploration of what it means to live—but never does so unfairly or at the expense of his characters' right to dignity and reality (a right that he very much does grant his characters).Never Let Me Go is narrated from nearly a decade before its publication. As Kathy quietly reminisces from her vantage in the late 1990s, she gradually comes to explore a life fraught with meaning and purpose—and fraught simultaneously with that kind of superlative meaninglessness that Ecclesiastes bemoans in all of its somber weariness. Kathy is a caregiver to recuperating donors and relates her special pleasure in the few instances in which she had been able to offer care to those who had been students at the exclusive (and, as it turns out, much envied) Hailsham, where she herself grew up. Memories of Hailsham water a fertile delta of memories through which we gradually come to understand both Kathy and the world she has inherited—a world filled both with much light and much darkness.In other words, a world much like mine or yours. Still, Kathy's story is unique and it is in her own tale's peculiarities that our own is better revealed. Better explored.Some may be tempted to see Never Let Me Go as ethical question and admonishment to this generation of readers and to the one that follows us. Certainly, that is there, but only as mise-en-scène to the larger panorama of a woman's quest to discern her past, present, and future from a glut of memories (some of which are only mostly trustworthy or even trusted) and how that journey sheds light on questions more important than mere ethical concerns. In Never Let Me Go, Ishiguro continues to play as he has in past works with memory and perception and how memory is so often the primary defense against perspicacity, yet as his narrator is acutely aware of her own remolding of history through nostalgia and forgetfulness, we are assured that perspicuity is not his target here.No. I believe Never Let Me Go is much more a perfectly plotted meditation (and its style is itself quite meditative) on the human condition, the place of our own hands in shaping our destinies, and what it means to live. These could all be clichéd topics but Ishiguro approaches with such a vaguely detached sublimity that he breathes (through Kathy his narrator) a certain verdant spirit into these things. They are never treated as anything more than mundane, but it is precisely by that treatment that he gives his purpose such power and impact.

I liked the main characters, their backgrounds and everything but something was definitely lacking and I can't figure out what. Was it worth reading? - I don't know.

20852354	As a child, Kathy H. attended Hailsham, an elite boarding school where children were raised to be both healthy and artistic and taught to believe that both their health and creativity were essential to themselves and to the world they would one day enter. Now an adult, Kathy reflects back on her life. She charts the very slow progression of her growth, her friendships with fellow students Tommy and Ruth, and her knowledge, as she herself gradually began to learn about her role in the outside worldand what this role dictates about her identity. A combination of heavy introspection and soft-scifi, Never Let Me Go has a thought-provoking premise and is brilliantly written, but fails to reach its potential, spending all its time in excruciatingly slow buildup and none of it in impact, theory, or debate. Enjoyable, but somewhat empty, and so moderately recommended.This book's greatest strength is its writing style, but it is also one of the most irritating aspects. Kathy, the narrator, is intensely thoughtful and analytical, breaking down her personal history into eras, important moments, and developing themes. She walks the reader through the story of her life much in the way she lived it, slowly, very slowly, bringing to light her final realizations. In other words, there is a lot hidden in this book, and it takes the book's entire lengthliterally until the last fifteen pagesto reveal it all. In between are circuitous examples, where Kathy starts to talk about one event, goes back a bit to explain why the event was relevant, explains the event itself, and then goes on without having drawn a major conclusioninstead, she's just mapped another point on her gradual arc or argument. The resulting pace is excruciating, both artful, brilliantly thought-out and executed, and simply painful as the reader is lead along, disappointed, and lead along again. The book's pace bring the characters to life (although both Ruth and Tommy lack some dimension) and, with it, the life that they lived, through Hailsham and beyond. As such, it is the highlight of the book, worked like an artform, but it is also intensely irritating and makes the book (which actually reads quite quickly) seem longer than it is.There are a near-infinite number of issues, from the ethical to philosophical, that could be brought to question and debate in this book. The very premise almost begs themboth the science of the base culture and the purpose of Hailsham itself. Unfortunately, however, none of these topics are brought to issue in the text. Instead, the book is consumed by the very slow progression of the story, the creep towards the "twist" revelations of who the children are and what purpose they serve. When finally revealed, these revelations are not all that bignot because they lack the potential to be, but because they pale in comparison to the immense buildup that leads to them. The characters just barely exceed the gradual revelation of the book's premise and are largely just passive carriers of the story, and so the other various issues, the possible debates, never enter into the text. So when other reviewers talk about the questions this book raises, what they're really talking about is the potential for questionsand that is not the same thing. The burden of meaning for this book, everything that the reader could take away and continue to think about, rests entirely on the reader, who must pull out the themes and ask the questions himself, carry on the debates himself. The author shirks his responsibility, and the book suffers for it, failing to live up to its potential.My final complaint with this book is that the underlying concept seems, blandly, unrealistic. **SPOILERS** follow, so be warned: The fact that in the book's contemporary culture the clones are considered non-human despite looking, acting, and living like humans seems entirely impossible. Consider: Humans never viewed the first cloned animals as different than their original counterparts; indeed, we were amazed and drew attention to the fact that they were identical, that they were clones. So why would cloned humans be any different (especially that these clones pass in human society as normal and indistinguishable)? Outside of the huge wastefulness of cloning entire humans just to harvest their organs, the fact that the cloned humans were not considered humans seems unreal to me, no matter who the gene donors were, no matter what brief attempts Ishiguro (though Ms. Emily) makes to justify it. **END SPOILERS** This is the underlying basis of the book's conflict and plot, and so problems with this concept create problems throughout the book. They weaken the foundations, making it difficult to accept the book and, as a result, even more difficult to take on the work of finding and analyzing themes, which the author fails too do. In the end, Never Let Me Go has a thoughtful premise with heavy potential for thought, theory, and debate, and it is skillfully, even artfully written, but the book fails to live up to its potential: the author does not tackle his own themes, and no matter how interesting the premise, it is an unreasonable one. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I did, but I felt cheated at the end: the final product was surprisingly empty, with the burden of meaning placed entirely and unfairly upon the reader alone.
3176968345	Recitesc, așadar, Să nu mă părăsești. Mi se pare și acum o carte foarte bună, chiar dacă unii au găsit-o „terifiantă”. Nu e neapărat un SF, nu este nici o carte horror (cum au catalogat-o - cam rapid - cîțiva cronicari), deși e neliniștitoare. Este mai degrabă un roman trist, foarte trist. Cineva mi-a mărturisit că a plîns la sfîrșitul cărții. Îl înțeleg: „Iar acum eu mă aflu aici, în faţa tuturor acelor lucruri, şi dacă aştept suficient de mult, de dincolo de cîmp va apărea o siluetă micuţă, care va creşte pe măsură ce se va apropia, pînă cînd am să văd că e Tommy, iar el îmi va face cu mîna, poate chiar mă va striga. Fantezia mea nu a mers mai departe - n-am lăsat-o eu - şi, deşi lacrimile începuseră să mi se prelingă pe obraji, nu plîngeam în hohote şi nu îmi pierdusem complet cumpătul. Am aşteptat puţin, apoi m-am întors la maşină ca să pornesc mai departe, indiferent care era locul unde trebuia să ajung” (p.323).Faptul cel mai ciudat din romanul lui Ishiguro este că „donatorii-clone” sînt liberi. Dar ei își asumă condiția ca și cum ar fi o fatalitate. Ishiguro a scris un roman despre condiția umană (omul ca ființă înrobită) și despre fragilitatea iubirii, cînd îți accepți soarta fără un singur murmur...P. S. Pe o idee înrudită, Klara și soarele mi-a plăcut mult mai puțin...
2890367040	Kazuo Ishiguro tells us the story of a clique of students living in the congenial atmosphere of Hailsham, an English boarding school far away from the city. Is there something flagrant or collusion happening behind the consonant nature of this school? Are the students of Hailsham different in some sort of way? The author tries to tell it through the eyes of Kathy, who was a schoolgirl who leaves the school after she grows up into a young woman. How will the products of Hailsham face the stark realities of their future? This novel explores hope and hopelessness, love and betrayal simultaneously. The author is also trying to discuss the importance of ethics in science. This novel is a conglomeration of literary fiction, science fiction, and romantic fiction. What I learned from this book 1) What should we do if things are not going according to our plans in our life? If things are not going according to our wishes, we should try hard to get things back on track. Even after we try our best, if it is still not going to our wish; then, we should learn to let it go. "You have to accept that sometimes that's how things happen in this world. People's opinions, their feelings, they go one way, then the other. It just so happens you grew up at a certain point in this process." "I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast. And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it's just too much. The current's too strong. They've got to let go, drift apart." 2) The importance of solitude Everyone is so vocal about the problems of loneliness and how loneliness can lead to anxiety and depression. It is indeed an important topic that needs discussion. But most of us are forgetting about the importance of solitude. Solitude is also a vital ingredient to make a person sane, just like companionship. “The solitude, I've actually grown to quite like... I do like the feeling of getting into my little car, knowing for the next couple of hours I'll have only the roads, the big gray sky and my daydreams for company." 3) The purest form of Love The author tries to discuss love from multiple angles in this novel. If we try to read between the lines, we can see love from a different angle that we haven't seen anywhere else, which is unique, pristine in its purest form, and has the propensity to touch our hearts and bring tears to our eyes. “You say you’re sure? Sure that you're in love? How can you know it? You think love is so simple? ” My favourite three lines from this book "It was like when you make a move in chess and just as you take your finger off the piece, you see the mistake you've made, and there's this panic because you don't know yet the scale of disaster you've left yourself open to." "Memories, even your most precious ones, fade surprisingly quickly. But I don't go along with that. The memories I value most, I don't ever see them fading." “It might be just some trend that came and went," I said. "But for us, it’s our life.” What could have been better? The pace of this novel, especially in the initial part, was a little slow. This is one of those rare novels which slowly grows on you. Rating 5/5 This is a must-read book for all those who loves to read literary fiction.
2471012808	I have no words…that’s my review*sobs heavily*
1887761602	Um...I'm sorry but I just didn't like it. (Insert frowny face) A few times I thought "okay, here we go!" But then nope, nothing, nada. The majority of the book felt like an epilogue.
136430463	I finally finished reading this book. Finally - is the key word. At first I thought the problem was with me - too busy to read, but now that I've finished it, I realise that the book itself was the problem. I've never read any Kazuo Ishiguro's works before, but this book is just pure boredom.Now don't get me wrong, the idea, the story, the characters are amazing. But the writing itself is simply horribly tedious. Right after finishing the book I downloaded the movie based on it. It's one of those rare cases when the movie is way better than the book. Why? Because things actually happen in the movie, the movie made me think, made me ask questions, made me shed a few tears... while every time I picked up the book, my attention was hopelessly lost after a few pages. The book consists of endless descriptions, memories of the main character... those are described so plainly and senselessly that seem to be pointless, arise no emotions at all. I honestly got the impression at some point that Ishiguro was just filling up empty spaces to ensure that the book gets published.Hope I haven't offended anyone with this, but I'm used to expressing what I really think about books.I regret that I spent so much time on this book. I advise people not to repeat my mistake and (can't believe I'm saying this) just go and see the movie. It's really great.
3558424334	This book is scary. Not because it’s horror in the common sense of the word. But because it’s terrifying that we might reach a point in society where children and people are so violated and used. And worse, complying. This isn’t a happy book. There’s no rebellion. This is a harsh story from the perspective of someone so okay with how they’re regarded. Not because the characters are stupid but because this is what they’re told and raised to believe. I recommend this book especially to the fans of The Handmaid's Tale. The narration style is different from the usual but I didn’t mind it. Kathy’s voice was a bit detached telling her story but I believe it was all part of the book and how society shaped her. It was certainly different from anything I read recently. I’m also glad I didn’t consider reading it when I was younger because I would’ve appreciated it less.
3073773597	I’m not sure why... There is something languid and at the same time shadowy about Ishiguro’s prose that reminds me of Franz Schubert. Something at once elegant and tense, lyrical and anguished, crystalline and autumnal. In the end, I confess that this novel moved me deeply.It is not at once obvious what the story is about. It is composed in the form of a memoir, written by a young woman, Kathy H., who looks back on her experiences as a child and, later on, as a teenager in an outlying boarding school, somewhere in England. She recounts several episodes involving her closest friends, most of them around minute events: a hand brushing against another, some kids’ artwork, a stark warning against smoking, a lost music tape, a teacher weeping, a scratched elbow, some dirty magazines, how some of the students give each other a pat, some causal sex, some inappropriate comments, etc.Yet, underneath all these minutiae, the narrator lets us feel that there is always something unsaid, troubling and strange. In many ways, Ishiguro’s book also echoes Atwood’s The Handmaid's Tale and that feeling of confusion and unease, but with a softer, low-key tone. Each chapter is built around one of these tiny events going on in this crooked little world, so that the mystery and suspense slowly build up, but we will hardly know what dark secret lies beneath it all until practically the very ending of the novel. A devastating, revolting reveal which is exposed in an almost pensive, resigned yet hopeless manner. It all comes down to a tragic tale about destiny and what it means to be mortal. Something like an impromptu by Franz Schubert...
564410570	i love rereads. not only do i get to revisit favourite stories, but i also get to see how i have grown as a reader. and comparing my previous review to my current thoughts, man. i have done a lot of growing. the first time around, i solely focused on the sci-fi/dystopian aspects (i love how its set in an parallel universe) and the narration. this time, i found myself so much more invested in the characters themselves. i spent so much time thinking about their existence, their reasons to live, and how they navigated each day with that knowledge. it was a much more emotional and thought-provoking reread. not that i didnt enjoy this story the first time i read it, but i feel like i got a whole lot more out of it this time. which only shows me that my reading experiences have become more meaningful than they were years ago. and that is a rewarding feeling. ↠ 4 stars
1901365888	Still remains one of my all time favourites.
1415201745	The first note I want to make about this book is to clarify from the Publisher's Summary that it is not an "edge-of-your seat mystery." I wouldn't even factor the mystery element of this story into deciding whether or not you want to read it. The primary categorization I'd use is Dystopian. I must admit that when I picked it up, I was looking forward to a dark & mysterious tale, and that isn't altogether what I got from this book so I can't help but feel let down in some ways. I am hoping that by mentioning this point from the get go I can save someone else from that potential disappointment.Never Let Me Go is a sequence of memories, as told by 31-year-old Kath, about her time at an English private school, Hailsham. This book raises some interesting ideas about autonomy & morality, but I also found myself having some feelings about the modern meat industry. It's hard to explain the relevance of these themes without spoiling specific points of the story, but suffice it to say each theme is communicated with a subtlety that I think worked well for the book. But that being said, the most eerie thing about this book is how the characters being affected never rail against the system that's oppressing them. There's no "aha" moment, no rebellion, no outrage. There's no satisfaction of knowing that the system has been toppled & that things will change after the conclusion. There's a bit of hang wringing, some muttered disappointment, but most of all there is a quiet acceptance.The characters we often look up to in Dystopian tales are the ones who sacrifice life & limb to dismantle their society's flawed ideas about social justice. These are the characters we rally behind & support even when the odds seem insurmountable. Those aren't the characters you will find here. By the end, there isn't even an outright condemnation of the Dystopian set up. It's left up to the reader to decide how their own morality applies to the situation. That's what makes it so scary to read. One of things I really enjoyed is Ishiguro's writing style. His flow is graceful & the diary entry style language is very relatable. Often times it felt like I was listening to a close friend tell me about her life. However, there is a quirk about Kath's storytelling that got on my nerves a bit. It has to do with the way she repeatedly uses a certain phrasing structure in order to build up tension before she reveals a plot point. It's something along the lines of "...until what happened a couple weeks later" or "...until I said what I said next," after which she proceeds to explain the thing. This method may have been more powerful if I found Kath's individual stories as interesting or dramatic as that lead up suggests, but unfortunately I just didn't. In fact, I felt somewhat underwhelmed with the actual content of her memories. It's not to say that they were boring, I just never felt 100% engaged with Kath or with the development of her relationships. Ishiguro did well creating an ominous atmosphere & the overarching conflict was unique enough for me to need to see it through. But I never fell in love with this book. It was fine, but I'm looking forward to watching the film now that I've read the book. I believe a talented cast of actors with the proper direction could create a more compelling final product with this Dystopian idea.
794979580	Check out my list of Seven Science Fiction Novels to Expand (and Blow) Your Mind.…and this is why Kazuo Ishiguro won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Never Let Me Go is hauntingly beautiful and eerily disturbing.The novel begins at a boarding school somewhere in the English countryside. On the surface, it seems like it will be a standard coming of age novel in a school setting.But gradually we understand that something is not right at this school. Some of the teachers seem to pity the students. Some are even afraid of them. And why don’t they seem to have any families?I won’t give away any further details about the plot, as it’s best to go into this one cold. This will let you enjoy Ishiguro’s storytelling power, which is in peak form in Never Let Me Go.Everything in this book is so well done: the beautiful writing, the character development, the emotional impact on the reader, and the big questions it raises. Never Let Me Go is matched only by Ishiguro’s latest novel, Klara and the Sun, in terms of expertly written science fiction that will expand your mind. I highly recommend both.
2353385788	Sublime... simply sublime. 31 year old Kathy recounts her life, and those of her friends, from an entire childhood spent at a boarding school, to an adulthood spent as a carer -slowly, page by page, using Kathy as the narrator the shocking reality of the group's lives is revealed.I give this book all my bookish love, for the slowly revealed horror of the protagonists' existences, the harrowing lives they lead, and most of all for forever haunting me with this exquisite speculative fiction masterclass. How did Kazuo do it? He entwined beautiful and subtle underplayed romances with the horror of their lives - yet, on completion, I realised that these romances were profound, epic and essential to the story! What can I say, other than - Holey Hannah Montana, I am so Happy that I have further Kazuo Ishiguro books to read! 'Ate out of 12..
5702403697	Nie wiem czemu książki tego autora tak głęboko mnie dotykają, ale chyba w prostocie tkwi geniusz.
2197353926	My name is Glenn S., and I’ve been a reader now for several decades. That might sound like a long time, but it’s not, really. Certainly it’s not as long as it felt getting to the end of this book.Never Let Me Go? Believe me, I wanted to. Especially after reading yet another languorous passage about a minor squabble among students about who said what to whom or which of the half dozen interchangeable school teachers at Hailsham (Miss Lucy? Miss Emily? Miss Geraldine?) did what boring thing to the “collection,” or gave someone a sharp look, which would be revisited 10 chapters later so that you’d have to flip back to see what all the fuss was about in the first place.I apologize for that last sentence. It’s not very Mr. Kazuo. Mr. K. writes calm, meditative, Zen-like sentences that almost put you to sleep. His idea of tension is planting little clues at the end of chapters so you keep on reading. Here is an example:We started to walk back towards the main house then and I waited for her to explain what she meant, but she didn’t. I found out though over the next several days.(Seriously. That’s supposed to be a cliffhanger – what one kid meant when she said that thing!) Don’t get me wrong. Mr. Kazuo’s soothing prose worked really well in his Booker-winning masterpiece, The Remains Of The Day. But it’s also because the protagonist of that book, the unreliable narrator Stevens, was a fascinating figure who had lived a lot of life, even if that life had been largely unexamined. And the book also had the undercurrents of history – and our knowledge of the past – running through the prose.The narrator of this book, Kathy H., part of a quasi love triangle with fellow Hailsham students Ruth and Tommy, isn’t nearly as complex. But as she ages and reexamines things, she begins to understand more: about how the three of them grew up and what their destinies are in this vaguely dystopian world.Mr. Kazuo’s themes are clear: What is a soul? What makes up a life? In the end, isn’t it things like kindness and generosity that matter? Those themes are enough to raise my rating to a 3. But I still have some questions about the plot. (Stop here if you want to avoid spoilers.) Why didn’t the donors try to escape? It doesn’t seem like there was any patrolling of borders in this world. How exactly did the cloning program work? Could only the wealthy afford to receive clone-grown organs? If so, that would have been an intriguing comment about class. Were there other advances in technology besides the cloning? It would seem that world-building would have to be a part of writing a novel like this (see also The Handmaid’s Tale or even Ready Player One).I believe my time is up. I will now drink some mineral water and eat some biscuits, rest a bit, and hope that my next book is better.
216682471	I loved this novel not so much for its gothic darkness, but for the questions it raised. It seems chillingly plausible that any cruelty, carried on long enough, will be accepted as the norm by humanity-especially if it benefits the majority (like providing an endless supply of organs). We manage this by dehumanising the victims. India's untouchables and America's slaves are just two of the examples. Even when we, as "enlightened" human beings, look back in disgust at such historical injustices, shouldn't we ask ourselves the question: "Am I any different?" I constantly do, and am frightened by the answer sometimes...The writing of the novel is weak compared to "Remains of the Day", and the main plot device (art and literature providing evidence for the "soul") is rather trite, but Ishiguro must be congratulated in creating a future which is a dystopia only from the main protagonists' point of view, and drawing us into the same and making us feel the horror. The novel is science fiction in a sense, and gothic in another, but I would hesitate to include it under either category because ultimately it addresses the ephemeral nature of human existence from the viewpoint of a doomed character, and thus grows beyond any genre categorisation.I would recommend it wholeheartedly to any lover of serious literature.
295505122	Completely unforgettable. This is, and will remain, one of my favourite novels of all time.
26217320	** spoiler alert ** A major disappointment. Ishiguro starts with an interesting premise but makes very little out of it, and ends up with a limp, unsatisfying story.Some of the positive reviews about this book seem a little strained -- we're supposed to reflect on the similarity of our own "doomed" lives to those of the clones. But it doesn't really wash. There's never a sense that any of the characters are struggling with the dead-serious issues that make life worth living; they're herded from stage to stage like cattle, mooing articulately and chewing their cuds with a vague sense of malaise, but never actually taking their lives in hand. Their own impending fates don't seem to mobilize them into action, or concentrate their minds at all.So it's a frustrating read. Ishiguro's deliberately sketched this story in a low key way (which is cool to read), but there are way too many holes in the story and the drama just leaks out steadily. With few genuinely provocative ideas and a wispy narrative line, you hope for a climax that's going to pull it ll together. But when it arrives, it's a drippy and embarrassing affair, with much preaching and obviousness. Any impact the story might have had gets instantly diluted. Hate to sound harsh. But by the time the book ambled to a close, I felt like the characters might as well be carved up for their innards -- they didn't seem to be willing to take the risks necessary to have an actual life.
242082445	Never Let Me Go, Kazuo Ishiguro's Examination of Science and MoralityIt was a warm spring afternoon, late in the semester. The windows of Ten Hoor Hall were open. The swarms of honey bees could be heard, hard at work in white blooms bursting from the hedge of abelia that ran across the front of a concrete and brick neo-classical building that housed the history, philosophy, and speech departments on the Campus of the University of Alabama.That was the day I determined not to pursue my intended career as a teacher of history, the cause of more than one day of regret through many years. Dr. Robert Johnston was rushing to the close of the second semester session of Western Civilization. The day's lecture concerned the end of World War II. Behind me the sonorous snore of a campus athlete vibrated through my skull. At the base of the lecture hall, Dr. Johnston was emphatically explaining the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan. It was at that moment I decided to pursue another field of endeavor where those I sought to serve did not sleep through the performance of my service. My ego has shrunk by several sizes since that day. There are definitely those times when I wished my clientele would nap while I accomplished my job.But, even as I had decided to steer a different academic course, something happened to make me lean forward, watching Dr. Johnston's reaction to another student's question, who had dared interrupt his lecture. One simply didn't do that. Dr. Johnston was the flood of knowledge. Our job was simply to sit there as sponges and absorb the wisdom he imparted."Dr. Johnston?" A timid voice tremulously floated through the hall."And...What's that?" Johnston's prominent adam's apple bobbled above his regimental striped bow tie. It was blue, gold, with distinctly white diagonal lines dividing the broader bands of color. Dr. Johnston was retired United States Navy. His specialty was United States Naval History. Actually, he was a legend in the academic field."It's me, Dr. Johnston!""I see that. What is your question, young woman?" His dark eyes seemed to penetrate the petite speaker."I was just wondering?""Yes. Get on with it. Get on with it. Speak up, young woman. So the rest of this class that is awake can hear the discussion that grows from this interruption.""Sir, do you think it was morally right that President Truman made the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?"I watched Dr. Johnston's chest expand as he swallowed a mouthful of air. His lips pursed. His hands dropped from the lectern to his sides. His shoulders slumped. He appeared to grow smaller as his usual ramrod straight posture seemed to collapse upon itself. He appeared to be looking at his notes, but he wasn't. The answer wasn't in his notes.He raised one hand, fingers touching shirt front, tie, and eyeglass frame, as he formed his response."Morality. Was it moral? Was it right, in other words?" His words trailed off. His stare was at the exit doors to the hall. He was somewhere else. He was perfectly still until I noticed the slightest sway of movement. For Dr. Johnston was no longer in 1971, he had returned to September, 1945. Dr. Johnston had assumed his sea legs stance on the unsteady deck of a naval ship. "I was on a troopship, a transport, carrying hundreds...hundreds of American boys, some of them younger than any of you in this room. We were bound for Honshu. We were headed for the home islands of Japan when we heard the war was over. Over at last. I would never carry another mother's son to die on some God forsaken piece of dirt that had no strategic or tactical value. God, the Marines. The Marines. Peleliu, Tarawa, Iwo, Okinawa. Moral? Ask the dead. If you can find them, ask the living that were on those troop transports. I can't answer your question. Each of us has to answer it. This class is dismissed."Dr. Johnston's response is one I've heard from many sources on many issues regarding the morality of a particular decision of historical import. It is the ethical principle of utilitarianism. We can thank the likes of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill for the principle of the greatest happiness theory. It's been ages since Philosophy 101, but those names ring a distinct bell. Yet, I also think of another professor, this one of Law. Jay Murphy was my favorite professor, though he only taught me one course--Labor Law. Professor Murphy was a Buddhist. One day he had traffic blocked on University Boulevard, bent over, hands palm out, as he looked intently down at some small object on the asphalt. It was a caterpillar. The Buddhist professor was adamant that the caterpillar would get safely where it intended to go. Even the life of a bug was precious to him. After all, given time, that caterpillar turns into a butterfly. There are two sides to every question.So, that brings us to Kazuo Ishiguro and his acclaimed novel Never Let Me Go short listed for the Booker Prize in 2005. Turn the last page, and if you're not too stunned by the power of Ishiguro's words, you'll find that the author was born in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1954. Although it's impossible to know the origin of an author's work, unless he has directly addressed the subject, I had to wonder if this magnificent book was Ishiguro's response to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If not that, Ishiguro does directly raise the issue of the potential of science to cross over the boundaries of morality. Or, on its most simple level, Ishiguro simply decided to turn the genre of science fiction on its ear, showing what might be accomplished in an over laden field of books, many of which should never have seen the light of day.Ishiguro definitely surpasses that simple level. At the minimum, this is a novel that questions the morality of advancements in science and technology. At the optimum, it addresses the very issue of the use of weapons of mass destruction that in fact exist, though sometimes just can't seem to be found anywhere. Further commentary on the second war against Iraq ceases here.It is especially difficult to review a work of this magnitude without resorting to spoilers. Where necessary, the appropriate alerts will be posted.Ishiguro's plotting is deceptively simple, using the perspective of Kath H., a student at an exclusive boarding school, Hailsham. In three sections, spanning early student days to young adulthood, Kath tells of life at school, after graduation, and her career choice. Kath focuses on her continuing relationship with two fellow students, Tommy and Ruth.Hailsham is an environment especially suited to enhancing creativity in their students. Whether it be painting, music, drawing, poetry, or prose, students were encouraged to create works of art. Periodically a woman known to the children only as Madame, comes to Hailsham to select works of art which leads the children to believe their work is placed in a special gallery. To have one's work selected by Madame is a coveted honor. Additionally, the children participate in exchanges of one another's art, vying for what they consider to be the best.Kath's attention is called to Tommy because of his frequent outburst of temper. Tommy is targeted by other students for his lack of creativity and the fact they know every button to push to launch him into a fit of rage. Tommy confides in Kath, much to her discomfort, for being seen as his friend could affect her own relationship with her fellow students. But when Tommy's behavior gradually begins to change until he exhibits no further rages, he is no longer the target of bullies. There's no challenge anymore. Tommy provides no reaction other than to shrug and walk away from his would be tormentors. Ishiguro's portrayal of bullying is masterful. Ruth is the central figure around whom Kath and Tommy revolve. Ruth is a would be leader, a believer that each of them is special and that a special future awaits each of them because of their status as Hailsham students. Ruth is self-centered, selfish, manipulative, and a master at the art of triangulation.As Kath, Tommy and Ruth move into later adolescence, it is Ruth who will become Tommy's sexual partner, for reasons unrelated to love for Tommy. Kath's normal sexual urges are twisted by Ruth to be evidence of abnormality, and that Tommy, whom she uncouples from, would never view Kath as a partner because of what amounted to sleeping around. Tommy will only consider her a friend, not a mate.Ishiguro takes his title from an imaginary song, "Never Let Me Go," sung by an imaginary cabaret singer which is on a cassette tape Kath buys at one of the periodic sales held at the school, when the children are allowed to buy things with tokens earned from their creative work. In one instance that becomes central to the question of the nature of Hailsham, Kath dances to the song while holding a pillow against her, as if she were holding her own baby. She turns to find Madame standing in the doorway watching her. Tears stream from Madame's eyes. Madame rapidly turns and departs without explanation, a continuing mystery woman whose comings and goings at the school have no apparent reason to the children.The growing horror of the fate that awaits the children of Hailsham is created by the simple straightforward delivery of Ishiguro's chosen narrator, Kath. It grows readily apparent that something waits for each student in the future. Why do no parents ever visit at Hailsham? Why are the teachers called Guardians as opposed to teachers? Why is Hailsham located in a remote area of England with no visible traffic zipping back and forth?At Hailsham, the children are told their fate, but not in a manner which is understood. The management of Hailsham is a network of deceit, lies and manipulation. The children have no baseline of behavior outside the walls of the school to know otherwise. The language in which the Guardians address the children is reminiscent of Orwell's "double-speak" in 1984."Never Let Me Go" is the most appropriate title for the song Kath loves but does not understand. It is Ishiguro's perfect title for this compelling novel. For the forces that drive Hailsham have no intention of any of its students gain freedom. Ever.(view spoiler)[The secret of Hailsham is one of ultimate selfishness of which any society should be ashamed. No parents come to the school because each of the children is a clone. They are walking, living organ banks, raised to be donors for others. The identity of the recipient is unknown, although Kath and Tommy learn that it is a practice that is accepted by the populous of the UK. An entire nation has accepted the price of the lives of others on the premise that clones, in fact, are mere shadows of real people. The children of Hailsham were meant to be raised in the shadows. It's a fact that anonymity covers a multitude of sins. Isn't it easier to drop a bomb from an incredible height and never see the destruction on the ground, compared to hand to hand combat? It always has been. It always will. Now, a human sits at a controller, as if simply playing a video game, navigating an unmanned rocket bomb to its intended target. At quitting time, mission over, the gamer goes home to whatever life they live outside the office. Hailsham was actually an experiment to show that clones are as human as any child created from the collision of sperm and egg. That's what society doesn't want to know. (hide spoiler)]Each of us faces questions on a regular basis. Will we do something simply because we have the ability to do it? Or do we weigh the consequences of the possible against the cost of the act?I must return to that warm spring afternoon in 1971 as I listened to Dr. Johnson. My beloved Uncle celebrated his 21st birthday at Hickham Field. He never spoke of what he saw that day. He island hopped across the Pacific. He never spoke of what he saw. In September of 1945, he was on a troop ship headed to the home islands of Japan. I've often wondered if Dr. Johnson was an officer on board that transport.I think of Robert Oppenheimer on the morning of July 16, 1945, at the Trinity Test of the first explosion of the atomic bomb in a desolate area of New Mexico. Afterwards he said he thought of the words from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."With Never Let Me Go, Kazuo Ishiguro, a man born in Nagasaki, reminds us that any action, no matter the reason, has a price. The question is, "Is it worth it?" Each of us has to answer that question.For, Robert Johnston, Professor, Department of History, The University of Alabama; Jay Murphy, Professor of Law, The University of Alabama School of Law, Woodrow Gaskin Burke, beloved Uncle, teacher and friend, all of whom had to answer the question in his own way"
5406592943	Three stars for bringing me into the depressive mood. I mean, I've read his books before and got used to a permanent feeling of sadness and nostalgia, but this is a new level of phychological devastation.Behind a simple story of growing up in a boarding school are hidden search for the meaning of life, disturbing questions of love, friendship and what makes us humans. I watched the movie years ago, so the ending didn't strike me as surprise. Yet still it was heart-breaking.
2092009859	2 ½ stars. I’m kicking myself for going into this expecting a fast-paced novel I’d rocket through. Because this book may be post-apocalyptic and all depending on The Twist [which comes like a third of the way through, by the way] but it is certainly not fast-paced. Basically, even though I appreciated things about Never Let Me Go, my reading experience of this was 99% awful. I’ve split this review into several parts, but my overarching opinion falls into one category: this book has clever ideas, but they’re not the focus. Instead, Never Let Me Go becomes a long list of memories. There is such a thing as taking show, not tell, too far - it’s when what you’re showing is beginning to bore the reader. Listen, if there are three thousand reveals or a deep character arc running through the book, we’re fine, but there are approximately two reveals and a bunch of character memories that failed to make me feel attached. → the characters ← I want to say that I like the idea of Cathy’s character. She has been so torn down, so forced to be one thing that she has never considered being anything else or finding a different path in life. It is awful and horrifying. And yet, two things: one, she has no character voice, and two, the focus is not on developing Cathy. That is absolutely fine. Unless you’re me and literally only care about character development. → the romance ← I’m so sorry, but this book did an utterly awful job with character chemistry. Tommy and Cath… I’m sorry, I just didn’t believe it. (view spoiler)[After spending an entire book screwing around and being just friends, they decide they’ve been in love for years because his ex girlfriend tells him they are. And then they start having sex and it is described so goddamn clinically. (hide spoiler)] They clearly care about each other, but where’s the romantic side to this? I don’t even really attach to them as best friends. Neither of them are all that likable or even all that relatable. → the worldbuilding ← A good idea, but I really don’t think this works when we see nothing about the rest of the world. I had sort of hoped the world would get expanded, we’d see the true context of normalcy juxtaposed to what the leads go through, and it just does not happen. → the morality conflict ← It’s as if authors of 2005 think they can bring up a topic, offer zero new insight into said topic, and hope the audience thinks about the book in the future. Which, okay, I admit this strategy can work. If you’re attached to the characters enough to feel your heart break in tandem. I was not. → the audio format ← I think, in general, listening to an audiobook of a book like this was a mistake. This is a book that required my skimreading technique. If I had read this in physical copy, I am quite confident I would have turned pages in a rush, read the whole thing in two hours skipping half the sentences, and liked it quite a bit more - I’m sure some of my thoughts would be similar, but the few reveals could’ve bumped this to a three or four at least. But by the end of this book… I was just waiting for it to end. I could no longer connect to Cathy because the book just needed to end. And that’s something to know for the future - about my reading style and about this book.Oh well. I guess we can't win them all, right?Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube
1174559676	Overall boring and not really enjoyable. The entire thing is just so juvenile and pedestrian. Even Ishiguro's trademark amazing prose is completely absent from this work. You don't care for the characters who themselves are insults to cardboard cutouts. Definitely Ishiguro's worst book. The man who wrote "The Remains of the Day" and "The Unconsoled" is dead, this novel is but an afterthought in a bibliography of solid works.
4851149391	Went into this completely blind after only really seeing the hype behind it… what a heartbreaking surprise. 😭 So haunting and devastating, the mundanity in ruth’s delivery of their situation made it all the more eerie while still being so heartwrenching and beautiful. i’ll always appreciate a book that has a unique concept but knows when to keep from spiraling into a 400+ page brick of over-exposition. Just very sharp, engaging and emotional storytelling that dealt so well with truly complex characters in an unfathomable situation, I love how this was told.
2218156495	'When I watched you dancing that day, I saw something else. I saw a new world coming rapidly. More scientific, efficient, yes. More cures for the old sicknesses. Very good. But a harsh, cruel world. And I saw a little girl, her eyes tightly closed, holding to her breast the old kind world, one that she knew in her heart could not remain, and she was holding it and pleading, never to let her go. That is what I saw. It wasn’t really you, what you were doing, I know that. But I saw you and it broke my heart. And I’ve never forgotten.’This was quite an upsetting and bleak book. It was utterly compelling and simultaneously awful. It will stay with me for a long time. My next book will need to be rousing and cheerful..

Насправді, мені було страшно, і не за персонажів, а за себе, бо це перша антиутопія яка стала такою близькою, що здавалося все почнеться найближчим часом. Книга з безліччю етичних і моральних питань, але яка далеко виходить за їх межі і просто перевертає твій світ! І так, переклад та оформлення прекрасні.
118827467	Somtimes sad is ok. If you are looking for something "Ok sad", might I recommend Sad Keanu. See it is sad, but kind of funny and people can have fun and have had fun for quite sometime. Sad Keanu in a boat Sad Keanu watching football and my personal favourite Sad Keanu with panda. With "Never Let Me Go" there is no fun to be had here,none. Not only is it sad and depressing as shit, it is also cold. It is set in England which goes without saying...damp(the worst kind of cold). The teachers are cold, Ruth is cold, the doctors, the nurses, us as a society,COLD.Like the friggen North Pole. This is a really well written book, I added an extra star because I am acknowledging the writing, its the suicidal thoughts afterwards that are killing the star rating here and I was not looking for rainbows and unicorns, but when I finished this I just thought "God Damn I am so sad now" So I want to be very clear I found this DE-PRESS-ING.
1993022323	This book is on my all,time top ten list. It left my heart broken and my mind racing. I actually assigned it to my graduate students because I really needed to talk to so,embody about it.
106337332	This book absolutely should have won the Hugo award for 2006. It wasn't nominated. Why? Because it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize? Because the author's other novels aren't science fiction? I don't know. But it is definitely the most significant, disturbing, haunting - and enjoyable - recent SF novel that I have read.In an alternate-reality England of the 1990s, a woman named Kathy reminisces about her childhood at a school called Hailsham. Her experiences, at first, are those that might seem normal – both the joys and travails – to anyone familiar with British boarding schools. And of course, Kathy does perceive her experiences as having been "normal," because, like everyone, she sees her past only in the context of her own experiences. But, as we quickly realize, from our perspective, Kathy's life is not normal at all. She, and all the students at Hailsham, are clones created solely for the purpose of organ donation.What's exceptional about this book it how Ishiguro created a tense book, with a creeping sensation of growing horror, solely through the voice and perceptions of Kathy – who, although intelligent and creative, is essentially a passive character, a product of lifelong conditioning and training to accept her fate as inevitable duty.Nearly everything is told to the reader "between the lines" – The characters themselves are naiively unaware of the dreadful pathos of their lives. We never even really see the "villains" in this society (although the reader is led to think of questions of bioethics and what people in our own reality are also willing to do - people in this world do already die because others want their healthy organs).The title works as a metaphor for the whole book, in a way – if we asked Kathy what "Never Let Me Go" means, she would tell you it was the title of a song on a secondhand tape that she listened to (and misunderstood) as a girl – but as readers, we can see that it refers to the creation of a situation where, even without guards or electrified fences, human beings are trapped so deeply by their own selves that the concept of fleeing a dreadful end (which they do realize is dreadful) doesn't once even occur to them.It is clear that it has occurred to Ishiguro, however, when he gives us a scene where children are discussing prison camps with electrified fences, and the guardians are explicitly uncomfortable. The fences around these people are not electrified, nor tangible, but they are just as real - and they continue to exist even when physical 'freedom' is granted.

(آره بیاین بگین ایشی گورو به خاطر این کتاب نوبل نگرفت، می‌دونم) می‌خوام بگم ایشی گورو بزرگ‌تر از دهن و قلمش نوشته. این کتاب با باقی کتاب‌های یانگ ادالت چه فرقی داره؟ چپوندن دغدغۀ انسانی و برچسبِ ساینس فیکشن؟ یه نفر بیاد بگه چرا این کتاب ساینس فیکشنه تا باهاش مفصل بحث کنم که نیست یا جیغ بزنم فرار کنم تا یه مدت در هیچ جامعه‌ای ظاهر نشم. :)) و گودریدز جنایت بزرگی کرده که اینو ساینس فیکشن حساب کرده. اینکه شما از انسان‌های آزمایشگاهی حرف بزنی داستانت ساینس فیکشن نمی‌شه. چرا اینو گرفتین دست‌تون؟ آدم فکر می‌کنه هیچی از ساینس فیکشن نمی‌دونین. اینجا یه آقا پوریایی دیدم گفته ساینس فیکشن دونستن این کتاب مثل این می‌مونه که بگی 1984 هم ساینس فیکشنه، و همین‌قدر خنده‌داره. فکر نکنیم برای ارزشمند کردن یه کتاب باید یه برچسب ادبی روش بزنیم. کار باید خودش معرف باشه، و این نیست. یه فکت علمی به من نشون بدین تا ساکت شم. اینطوری باشه هرکسی می‌تونه ساینس فیکشن بنویسه.ایشی گورو و این کتاب مشخصاً زیادی تحویل گرفته شدن. کلاً شما عشق و جوونا و یه فضای غریب و ترسناک و سانتیمانتالیسم رو بچپون توی داستان، اگه کتابت نفروخت بیا یقۀ منو بگیر. می‌خوای ایشی گورو باش یا هرکی دیگه. من می‌تونم با این کتاب از ایشی گورو بیزار بشم. می‌گم چرا، بالاتر هم کمی گفتم. از دلایل دیگه‌م اینه که این کتاب به لحاظ تکنیکی واقعاً شاهکاره، و ایشی گورو انگار اینو می‌دونسته. این رفت و برگشت‌ها، کاشت‌های دقیق داستان، همۀ اینا رو با یه آسوده‌خاطری و اعتمادبه‌نفسی گذاشته که ما فکر می‌کنیم داریم یه داستان عالی می‌خونیم. بله منم مثل خیلی‌های دیگه سرنوشت بچه‌ها رو پیش‌بینی می‌کردم ولی این نه غمگینم کرد نه خوشحالم. منزجرم کرد. ایشی گورو بدون هیچ پستی و بلندی‌ای این کار رو نوشته. هیچ خروج از ریلی نداریم. خروج از ریل در سطح ایده رخ داده و نویسنده اینقد بهش اطمینان داشته که پیش برده‌ش. بسیار پرطمطراق. بسیار خودنما. بسیار نشون‌ندادنی! من بارها حین خوندن حس می‌کردم حتی راوی هم انگار خسته شده از بس حرف زده، همه‌چی به ما گفته شد. الان می‌فهمم چرا آرمینا می‌گه من از راوی اول شخص خوشم نمی‌آد چون انگار داره همه‌چیو توضیح می‌ده. وقتی اینو گفت با خودم گفتم نه بابا، چه نامردی. همۀ اول شخص‌ها که اینطوری نیستن. و دقیقاً باید کتابی رو بخونم که اول شخصش همین‌طوریه! :)) بسیار حراف، بدون نشون دادن. اینقد نشون نمی‌ده که من هیچ تصویری از شخصیت‌ها و محیط اون مدرسه بیمارستان یا هرکوفتی هست ندارم. می‌خوام بدونم چطور با این کتاب ارتباط برقرار کردین وقتی اینقد بدون تصویر بوده. برای من سرنوشت شخصیت‌ها اصلاً مهم نبود. نویسنده حداقل اینقد عقل داشته که خیلی عامه‌پسندطور نکنه داستانو و جزییات عاشقانۀ کلیشه‌ای نذاره، ولی برای من لوس بود کلاً رابطۀ شخصیت‌ها و رفتارهاشون. من خودم نوجوون بوده‌م. من خودم مسائل عاطفی رو تجربه کرده‌م. داستان برای من یه سخنرانی‌ای بود که انگار همه قبلش داد زده بودن این سخنرانی خیلی مهم و جدیه، حواس‌تون باشه. و من تا ته گوشش دادم تا یارو از سکو رفت پایین. نفهمیدم چرا مهم بود. نفهمیدم چرا جدی بود. یه سری کلمه پرت شدن توی صورتم و مچاله شدم زیرِ بارِ اهمیت زیادی برای این شخص و سخنرانیش.چون کانیا گفته مجموعه داستانش خیلی خوبه و بازم کانیا یا یه بدبخت دیگه‌ای بم گفته غول مدفونش خیلی خوبه، می‌خوام اونا رم بخونم و خیلی از ایشی گورو بدم نیاد. اگه دوستام نمی‌گفتن بدم می‌اومد ولی. ایشی گورو بهتر بود کارهاش همون مایۀ بازماندۀ روز داشته باشن تا این حرفا. دربارۀ ترجمه هم بگم من مال غبرایی رو خوندم و اومدم کلی اینجا و جاهای دیگه خوندم که چقد ترجمۀ سمی خوب نبوده بندۀ خدا. ولی بذارین بگم ترجمۀ غبرایی هم... نه اینکه بد باشه، ولی بر نمایشیِ بودنِ داستان افزوده. به مصنوعی بودن و باورناپذیر بودنش. اولاً نثر داستان بعضاً دچار کلماتی می‌شه که آدم فکر می‌کنه داره بالزاک می‌خونه مثلاً. حس یه داستان 1990 طور رو به آدم نمی‌داد. مورد دوم که باعث میشد دربرابر کتاب خیلی مقاومت کنم، اسمش بود. هرگز ترکم مکن؟! ینی هیشکی پیدا نشد بگه این اسم مناسب نیست آقای غبرایی جان؟ من از شما ترجمه‌های خیلی خوبی خوندم و همین باعث می‌شه بیشتر زورم بگیره اتفاقاً. خوبه این اسم از یه ترانه هم گرفته شده، نه شعر که بگی چون شعره اینطوری ترجمه شده. هرگز ترکم مکن دیگه چه کوفتیه.
204666391	Some titles that come to mind when I think of dystopia include 1984 and The Hunger Games, both of which are fantastic books. The mention of dystopia always triggers certain scenes to play in my head: big explosions, rebellious uprisings, and underground brain-washings. Never Let Me Go is nothing like that, yet it's just as powerful.The novel is about Kathy, a thirty-one year old woman who reflects on growing up with her friends Ruth and Tommy at Hailsham, a private school for special children. I hesitate to give away too many details because almost the entire plot was spoiled for me. Still, knowing about the story beforehand won't decrease one's enjoyment of the book - it's not the climax that makes it great, but Kazuo's delivery of information through his wonderful writing.Despite Kathy's detachment as a narrator, her quiet voice (ha, quiet voice. get it?) resonated with me. Her lack of anger, or simply any emotion broke my heart. I wanted to give her a good shaking and scream "see that boy? Go love him properly!" or "don't you know how badly you've been treated? You don't deserve that! Do something about it!"... but, I couldn't. And the fact that the characters couldn't do anything about their predicaments either saddened me tremendously.So to summarize this sloppy review: stunningly well-written, achingly melancholy.*cross-posted from my blog, the quiet voice.

7077320917	Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go is a captivating story that lingers in your mind long after you’ve finished reading. Set in an alternate version of England, the book follows Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, three friends growing up at a seemingly idyllic boarding school called Hailsham. At first, their lives seem ordinary, but as the story unfolds, you slowly uncover the unsettling truth about their purpose. Ishiguro writes with a delicate and emotional touch, weaving themes of friendship, love, loss, and morality into a narrative that’s both captivating and heartbreaking.This book would appeal to readers who enjoy thought-provoking novels that combine emotional depth with subtle suspense. Fans of dystopian fiction like The Giver or The Hunger Games will appreciate the ethical questions raised by the story, while those who love tales of the discovery of relationships and identity will connect with the characters’ struggles. It’s the kind of book that makes you think about what it means to live a meaningful life and how far society should go in the name of progress. If you enjoy novels that challenge your perspective while tugging at your heartstrings, Never Let Me Go is a must-read. -Allison X. (Teen Volunteer)Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro is a dystopia set in an institution similar to an orphanage with children, but as you continue reading the novel, you realize that this institution is quite odd, and the children in it are unlike others. The more you read the book, the harder it is to put it down as all you want is answers, what is this place? Who are these kids? And what makes them so different? This book had me hooked and I read the whole novel within two days, just looking to see what happens and more importantly why. If you are interested in other dystopias such as The Giver and Fahrenheit 451, then I suggest you add this book as the next book on your to be read list. -Sara K., SPL Teen Volunteer.
1882486507	I did as requested and didn't read any of the reviews before tackling this book.I liked the idea, of a tranquil boarding school with strange rituals and secrets hiding its true purpose.The writing itself was a bit tough going, kind of repetitive in certain instances i.e. "this reminds me of the time I was by the oak tree talking to Ruth"....."This is why the conversation by the oak tree was so important"...."anyway let me tell you about the story by the oak tree." See - pretty tedious.But I pushed on because I was really hoping all these hints would lead to some big reveal or some great twist. But unfortunately I found there was no great surprise, I'd more or less worked out what the schools purpose was and I found myself finishing the book with no real satisfaction.It was a great concept, but I feel so much more could have been done with it, the entire story just fell a bit flat for me. This might be because I'd had such high hopes to begin with - note to self never go into a book with too much expectation as it just makes the disappointment worse.I might still try another of Ishiguro's books though just to see if it’s universal or just this particular novel.
8049707307	Wow, just wow. I had no idea really what the novel was about before reading it. I'd read the description on the back of the book so was expecting something completely different. I mean, the description is correct. But it's so much moreI love how nothing is really explained to you. There's no explaining the science of the book and at no point does Kazuo Ishiguro hold your hand and explain it all to you. You meet these characters and then little nuggets of information are given to you. It's a little confusing at the beginning and then it just becomes so beautiful. It's a book about love and family. And parentage. It's a book about "what does it mean to be human?" It's also about accepting your fate. I'm glad I went in blind as this novel absolutely blew me away. It's pretty much a perfect novel. I can't think of a single sentence that I would have changed. It's a masterpiece and I heartily recommend it
2080741549	First, I loathe the scenario when serious literary authors write science fiction. Though in their hands it's always Speculative fiction. Almost universally, one has to then hear the hosannas of the mainstream critics hailing this work as if others haven't been writing in this genre for years.So I admit a bias, but this book's awfulness goes far beyond that.It's simply unbelievable. The fact that these people live in the world and somehow remain utterly oblivious to their situation well into their 30's. That they undergo what they undergo, and do so willingly, and yet are free to move about the country with nary a thought of just checking out is imbecilic.More damningly, It's inhuman.Ishiguro's gives the characters a fantasy about deferrals and love but somehow never gives them the idea of freedom or rebellion, even though they study art and literature voluminously.Never Let Me Go is the worst kind of sci-fi bc it take one idea and looks at it under a microscope, forgoing how this one idea is going to effect the rest of the world, but in Ishiguro's defense he never examines the rest of the world. He can't bc his asinine idea would fall apart.Real world example. Gutenberg creates printing press. Books become available to the masses. The Bible can be read by many instead of a few. Martin Luther decides his reading of the Bible is closer to God's truth than the Papists. People are stirred up by this interpretation and then many leaflets that are put out in defense of the failed monk. Wars ensue - the Enlightenment occurs.In Ishiguro's world, Gutenberg makes the printing press and all that happens is people devote their lives to printing books. End of story.The book is barely two characters and one is so naive that she quickly becomes tiring, but then again the author needs her to be child-like bc anyone would start asking a whole lot of questions long before any get asked.
34631131	** spoiler alert ** I was quite surprised at this book. That it was a Booker prize candidate was a shock. It has a very been-there, done-that feel. See The Giver, by Lois Lowry, The Island, a film of recent vintage in which the subject matter is very close indeed to the underlying concept here. In a closed, prep-school-type setting, a group of young people interact with themselves and their teachers and guardians. It takes no time at all to figure out what their role is, and in fact the ease of that made me wonder if this was not originally meant to be a young adult book. It could be except for some sexuality towards the latter parts of the book. I was amazed at the overall lack of curiosity of Ishiguro’s characters. While this may reflect the extant reality of people sheepishly going along with whatever nonsense is handed out by the powers of the day, it makes for questionable fiction. One character, a queen-bee sort named Ruth, shows that flare for knowledge, mixed in with her rather massive character flaws. Kathy is our narrator, an every-girl, eager to gain the attention of the exciting Ruth, kind to the bumbling, victimized Tommy. There are a few mysteries as the characters age. What is the Gallery? Why are some teachers afraid of them? Why do these children so passively accept that they were born, cloned, so that they could be a source for organ donation? It all seems ok with them. Doesn’t anyone try to escape? The outside world is as characterless as the world of the characters’ institutional lives. Weird. I was greatly disappointed in this, by the author of Remains of the Day. So we know he has better stuff in him. This was extremely derivative, almost cribbed in some ways. Been there-done that. This is what happens when you let your grad students write your books for you. There is no need to go there or do that again here.

24625379	In "Never Let Me Go," a fictional story focusing on three classmates from a unique boarding school, author Kazuo Ishiguro deals with questions of loss and mortality that each of must eventually confront. As we get older, as we lose our friends and family, as the environment around us changes and things once familiar to us disappear or become unfamiliar, as we cling to our memories of how things used to be, how do we come to accept the fact that our lives are finite and attach some meaning to our limited existence? These are questions that the narrator of "Never Let Me Go," Kathy H. copes with as she recounts the disjointed memories that comprise her life. Sorting through these memories, she finds comfort in her friends and her career, eventually coming to terms with the meaning of her life and her ultimate fate.Reflecting upon her life, Kathy devotes most of her time to thinking about her friends from Hailsham, a secluded boarding school where she grew up. Because contact with outsiders at Hailsham is limited, one of the school’s big events is the quarterly Exchange, where students are given tokens they can use to buy other students’ artwork. As this is the students’ only way of accumulating material possessions, they grow dependent on each other for their "personal treasures" and learn to value others’ work, forging unique bonds with one another. Kathy’s two best friends are Ruth, an extroverted leader at the school, and Tommy, a shy introvert who gets bullied due to his lack of creativity and inability to produce substantial work. While they depend on each other throughout their time at Hailsham, like a lot of friends they drift apart after leaving the school. Looking back at the petty argument that led to the group’s break, Kathy comments, "It never occurred to me that our lives, until then so closely interwoven, could unravel and separate over a thing like that." Kathy regrets the loss of her friends, but doesn’t do anything about it until she hears that Hailsham is closing: "[I]t started to dawn on me, I suppose, that a lot of things I’d always assumed I’d plenty of time to get around to doing, I might now have to act on pretty soon or else let them go forever." Realizing that her time is limited, Kathy decides what is important to her – what she doesn’t want to let go of – and reconnects with her old friends, Ruth and Tommy. In addition to her friends, Kathy’s career has a special meaning in her life. Kathy begins the book by identifying herself as a "carer." Although a lot of carers "are just going through the motions waiting for the day they’re told to stop," Kathy enjoys her work, the long drives and the solitude, and she knows she is good at what she does. As a carer, she helps look after patients, assisting as they recover from "donations" and keeping them calm. She knows that she is a good carer, which is important to her: "[I]t means a lot to me, being able to do my work well." However, when she becomes Tommy’s carer, he questions the meaning of her work, asking her if she really considers her job to be important since all of her patients are going to "complete," or die, anyway. Kathy responds, "Of course, it’s important. A good carer makes a big difference." When reflecting upon her life, Kathy decides not only that her friends are important to her, but she also considers her job important, believing she makes a difference by helping others.However, as the book begins, Kathy only has eight months left as a carer, and then she will begin the last phase of her life. Initially, Kathy does not accept this fate, hoping to get a "deferral." When the headmaster of Hailsham tells her a deferral is not possible – Kathy cannot escape her ultimate fate any more than the rest of us can – Kathy wonders what the purpose of her life has been: "Why did we do all of that work in the first place? Why train us, encourage us, make us produce all of that? If we’re just going to give donations anyway, then die, why all those lessons? Why all those books and discussions?" In fact, one of the Hailsham teachers, Miss Lucy, had made this same argument when they were children, believing it was more important that they know their ultimate fate than worry about creating artwork and developing their sense of culture: "If you’re to have decent lives, you have to know who you are and what lies ahead of you." But this is not true, the Hailsham headmaster counters, addressing Kathy and Tommy: "Look at you both now! I’m so proud to see you both. You built your lives on what we gave you. You wouldn’t be who you are today if we’d not protected you." Ultimately, Kathy comes to agree with the Hailsham approach. When she meets a patient who did not go to Hailsham, but wants to hear all about her time there so that he can replace his own memories with Kathy’s, Kathy realizes "just how lucky we’d been." Without being warned what lay ahead – as Miss Lucy had wanted – Kathy had been free to live her own life; even if it was messy, it was hers. As the novel concludes, Kathy drives to Norfolk, where she had shared her happiest memories with Tommy: "I imagined this was the spot where everything I’d ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was standing in front of it." Instead of hanging on to those things and people she has lost, Kathy realizes that this is as far as her fantasy can go: "I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, and drove off to wherever it was I was supposed to be." Like most of us, Kathy knows her life is limited, and the best we can do is go about our everyday lives, doing what we are supposed to do. She will never let go of her memories of what she has lost, but she has accepted her fate. Though her life hasn’t been perfect, Kathy, reflecting upon her memories, finds that her life has been meaningful – having had close friends, an important job, and an idyllic childhood, she considers herself "lucky." But has she, in fact, led a decent life? Has her life been purposeful and meaningful? These are universal questions we may all ask of ourselves – how to accept our own mortality and assign purpose to the limited life we have been given. However, these big questions of how to deal with loss and mortality also become a source of frustration and disappointment for readers because, while "Never Let Me Go" builds these questions up, it never seems to fully resolve or answer them. Fortunately, though, it does provide some clues. One of the recurring items of the book relates to a song Kathy plays as a child called "Never Let Me Go." What makes the song special for Kathy is that she assigns her own meaning to the lyrics; instead of listening to the actual words, she imagines her own version of the song: "Even at the time, I realized this couldn’t be right, that this interpretation didn’t fit with the rest of the lyrics. But that wasn’t an issue with me. The song was about what I said." At one point, when Kathy is dancing to the song in her mind, Madame, a Hailsham leader, catches her and starts sobbing. Later Madame confesses that, when she saw Kathy that day, she imagined Kathy was holding onto the old world, a "kind world," which was being replaced by a "harsh, cruel world," but now Madame realizes her interpretation was wrong: "It wasn’t really you, what you were doing." Soon after Madame catches her playing the tape, the tape is lost, her friend Ruth tries to replace it, and later, with Tommy’s help, Kathy finds another copy of the tape. The symbolic implications are clear: just as she assigns her own meaning to the song, Kathy assigns her own meaning to life. Sometimes she may be lost, sometimes others like Tommy may help her, and sometimes others like Madame may assign a different meaning to her life than she does, but Kathy is the final author of her life. While others may deem her life meaningless, she herself is content, if not happy. "Never Let Me Go" may not provide a universal answer for some of the big questions it poses about loss and mortality, but the ultimate message seems to be one of hope: as the authors of our own lives, it is up to each of us to take what we are given and make the most of it.
95767887	This book - a "Man Booker Prize' finalist - has gotten good reviews so I had high expectations. The book is narrated by a young woman named Kathy. Kathy has a job as a "carer" (a sort of nurse) for special people called "donors."Kathy is telling the story of her life beginning when she was a student at an exclusive British boarding school called the Hailsham School. Kathy and her friends - Ruth, Tommy, Grace and others - seem to exhibit the usual kid behaviors. They form cliques, join clubs, play games, tease each other, have fights, and so on. The kids also go to classes taught by teachers called "guardians" and have their best artwork and poems collected by a periodic visitor called "Madame." In a lot of ways Hailsham seems more or less like a normal boarding school. It isn't however. The kids never seem to leave the school at all and we soon learn that they have no parents and are being groomed to be "donors" - which is just what you think it is. When the kids are grown they are expected to give away their body organs.Though the premise of the book is intriguing the story moves along excruciatingly slowly. Moreover, it's hard to identify with the characters who are, for the most part, not particularly likable. I really hated Ruth, who was a bitch, a liar, a manipulator, and a thief. Even the "nicer" characters though, like Kathy and Tommy, don't inspire me to care about them very much.As Kathy's story continues we see that the students finish their studies at the Hailsham School as teenagers and then move to "cottages" for a couple of years or so. By now the students are less sheltered and go out and about. They also engage in typical young adult behavior with a lot of hooking up and sex. After a couple of years or so in the cottages the students generally start their jobs as "carers," after being carers for a while they become "donors."I kept expecting the author to explain more about what was going on in the story: These kids seem to be clones but where did they come from? Who got the organs (or were they for some kind of research)? Why did the kids go along with this program? Why were the students so casual about death and sex? I never got the answers though.Though the author explores an interesting concept, the story just doesn't come together for me. You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/
4095514442	I listened to the audiobook of Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro. It was narrated by Rosalyn Landon who did an outstanding job of reading this book. Never Let Me Go was Kazuo Ishiguro’s sixth book. Although I enjoyed The Remains of the Day a bit more than this book, I still felt that this book was beautifully written and very thought provoking. My favorite book, though, was Klara and the Sun. Never Let Me Go was character driven with a very unusual and complex plot. There was a darkness to this book. I found it to be quite engrossing but its secrets and discoveries were revealed quite slowly throughout the course of the book. It touched upon my emotions in a variety of ways. Sometimes I was justifiably horrified by what had been revealed and at other times I felt good for what the characters were finally able to understand and accept. Never Let Me Go focused on the innocence and trust of young children, the knowledge young adults acquired and accepted and the acceptance and understanding of loss in later years of life. Once there was a special private school called Halisham that was located in the English countryside. The children who attended Halisham were always told that they were special. They were protected and sheltered from the outside world. There were very specific rules that the children had to follow and obey. Kathy H. was the protagonist and narrator of this book. She had been a student at Halisham but was now an alumni and thirty-one years old and a carer. Throughout the book, Kathy H., recounted her childhood memories and experiences at Halisham and how she only wanted to discover everything she could about the school and the people who ran it. Kathy H. finally succeeded in putting the pieces of the puzzle together about the place and school where she spent her entire childhood. The only thing was, that by the time she did it, it was almost too late to do anything about it. She discovered that all the rules and information that were passed down to the students by those in charge of the school had been lies. The children that attended Halisham had accepted and believed everything that they had been told. Perhaps the most important discovery Kathy H. made, though, was that Tommy, one of her friends during her years at Halisham, had actually always been her true love. Even though Kathy H. discovered this and finally acted upon this, it had been camouflaged for the longest time in the love triangle between Tommy, Ruth and herself. Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro was about the controversial act of cloning, the donation of human organs in a most unconventional way and love. It was about how certain behaviors could be justified for the greater good of mankind and advances in science. Never Let Me Go explored how certain people just accepted their fate and did not protest about how they were treated even when they were taken advantage of or treated unjustly. Kazuo Ishiguro has an exceptional way of writing about controversial subjects and he has a way of giving his readers a look into how these things might look in the future. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it very highly.
864166	** spoiler alert ** Set in a late 1990s England, Ishiguro places us in an uncomfortably realistic, sci-fi scenario where cloning is normative and routine. We follow the lives of Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, students at Hailsham, a picturesque boarding school. Only about halfway into the novel is the nature of this society completely revealed, when we find that the students are clones, living as normal humans until their organs are needed. Fortunately, the story never directly questions societal ethics of cloning. Doing so, even slightly, would have changed the tone to a political bent, shredding the tender story. And although he doesn't question cloning, he does, however, lead the reader to an underlying answer while maintaining a tight reign over the actual storyline. Ishiguro broaches many topics, such as societal detachment and the struggle of a minority class, but its his focus on the aching to belong, an experience that, I venture to guess, most people feel or have felt at some point, that gives us real emotions filtered, only mildly, through prose.Kathy is one of few students raised at Hailsham, where the caretakers focus on creative outlets; we discover later that the art is being preserved as possible evidence of students' humanity. Oddly enough, the caretakers miss the student's self awareness and emotional maturations, arguably the most human of all traits.Through Kathy H., we see that the students are capable of ranging emotions, from sadness and forgiveness to lust and curiosity. She excels as a "carer" because she interacts with the dying on a personal level, interprets their moods, and calms them. As a human-like force, she doesn't embrace the horrific outcome of her life and list towards death like many of her peers, she focuses on her friends, repairing old mistakes and forming stronger bonds.In spite of the sci-fi setting, the unique traits of Ishiguro's narratives, such as a languorous flow and inherent subtlety, allow him to slip rather significant items into the story without any grandiose epiphanies. You feel as though you're like sitting with a friend, listening to recalled events, some familiar and some new. After reading the last chapter, I honestly didn't know how to feel. Tapped out emotionally, I just desperately needed a hug. It's a rare occasion that instead of reading a novel, I experience it; a testament to Ishiguro's skill in crafting a story, not just words.
3776992981	I am a bit angry at this book. It was a waste of my time. Boring for most of the entire story. A nap would have been more freshingSlow paced! I kept thinking to myself, It has to get better, just read a few more pages. No, it never did. Like a good boy, I pushed onwards and finished this boring book. When the twist at the end came, I literally slammed the book down in a deeer depth of frustration. Never, ever recommend
2148224929	I read this book when it was first released and really loved it. I haven't finished an Ishiguro novel in years so it was really a delight to come back to it. I had forgotten basically everything except the basic premise of the book and I was so utterly wrapped up in it: his delicate prose, his eccentric narrator, the sadness that permeates the book but never seems to be fully felt. Ishiguro is, of course, a master of deep yet restrained emotion, but I had forgotten it in this book. I believe that when this book got relatively popular that my memory filled in the gaps I couldn't remember from my experience with it with assumptions about what it must be like. And of course it isn't like that at all.Read #3 Update: I can't say I recommend reading this book while the world is burning down. Instead of it feeling sad, as it did in my prior two reads, I found that the book became not about the kind of nostalgia I'd read in it earlier but about futility. A futility that Kathy doesn't even realize. A futility and passivity that she has taken on to survive and oh boy, thinking about the way your brain shuts down to get through horrifying things, that's a lot to take on in our current moment.
3547556435	I knew nothing about this book before reading it, and I recommend everyone doing the same. There are so many childish comments in the review section that make awful summary of this book.Just read it, and you will know why Kazuo Ishiguro won the Nobel Prize in Literature even if you don’t like the book.
