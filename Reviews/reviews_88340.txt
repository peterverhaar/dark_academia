1761667749	An anthology of longing Because I love you (you see, I do love you, you dimwit, my love engulfs you the way the sea loves a tiny pebble on its bed-and may I be the pebble with you, heaven permitting) I love the whole world and that includes your left shoulder-no, the right one was first and so I'll kiss it whenever I want to (and whenever you're kind enough to pull down your blouse a little) and that also includes your left shoulder and your face above me in the forest and your face below me in the forest and my resting on your almost naked breast. And that's why you're right in saying we were already one and I'm not afraid of this; on the contrary, it is my only happiness and my only pride and I don't at all restrict it to the forest. (Josef Sudek)When Milena Jesenskà , a Czech journalist and writer asked Franz Kafka for permission to translate his short story The Stoker (later published as the first chapter of Amerika) into Czech, she would not just become Kafka’s first translator, but also the addressee of a flood of enthralling and increasingly passionate letters - 149 letters and postcards, 140 written during 10 months, sometimes several times a day, from March to December 1920, the last ones between 1921 and 1923, a few months before Kafka’s death from TB on 24th June 1924 . Kafka’s letters, entrusted by Milena to Willy Haas, a common acquaintance, subsisted, unlike Milena’s letters to Kafka, which are presumed lost. Soon the correspondence alters into an consuming epistolary relationship when it deepens from a sharing of a profound mutual empathy (Her poverty. The unfaithfulness of her husband. Her loneliness. His fear. His illness. His fiancée), into a mutual baring of the soul and a long distance intimacy which brings Kafka despair, torment, bliss, sleeplessness as well as uttermost happiness: 'In their entirety as well as in almost every line, your letters are the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me.' (Alain Fleischer, Franz II ( Homage to Kafka))Writing one another several times a day, he most of the time in German, she in Czech, the criss-crossing of letters brought Kafka, exhausted by his illness and insomnia, on the verge of collapse. Torn by the ‘constant trepidation’ brought by her letters, he asked her to stop writing while at the same time begging for her letters: Yesterday I advised you not to write me every day, I still hold the same opinion today and it would be very good for both of us, and so I repeat my advice today even more emphatically- only please, Milena, don't listen to me, and write me every day anyway, it can even be very brief, briefer than today's letters, just 2 lines, just one, just one word, but if I had to go without them I would suffer terribly. (July 20, 1920).Both fascinated by and recoiling from Milena’s blistering personality and vivacity, Kafka writes to Max Brod his insomnia becoming unbearable because of his correspondence with her – ‘she is a living fire, of a kind I have never seen before’. According to Brod’s Franz Kafka: A Biography, Kafka held Milena in high esteem as a writer, comparing her psychological meditations and reportages on life in Vienna, books, fashion, meditations to the letters and travelogues of Theodor Fontane; observing the deplorable state of Kafka waiting in the office for a letter of Milena to arrive, terribly exalted, undermining his already weak health, he visits Kafka at the office to help him get through the long hours waiting for another letter or telegram of Milena. ‘But whenever these other letters come, Milena, even if they are basically more auspicious than the first ones (although on account of my weakness it takes me days to penetrate to their happiness)-these letters which begin with exclamations (and after all, I am so far away), and which end with I don't know what terrible things, then, Milena, I literally start to shake as if under an alarm bell; I am unable to read them and naturally I read them anyway, the way an animal dying of thirst drinks, and with that comes fear and more fear; I look for a piece of furniture to crawl under; trembling, totally unaware of the world, I pray you might fly back out of the window the way you came storming in inside your letter. After all, I can't keep a storm in my room. .And so we get swept away in a gruelling, paradoxical dance of push--pull relationship dynamics and inertia, a continuous veering between detachment and attachment, a relationship simultaneously intensifying and alienating partly because of the distance. Often packed in one letter, we find tender expressions of the desire to bridge the distance in a scorching longing for closeness (’I am so happy to breathe again with you so near. It is impossible to understand how my breast could expand and contract enough to breathe this air, it’ s impossible to understand how you can be far away. I kept wanting to hear a different sentence than you did, this one ‘you’re mine’. And why that one in particular? It doesn’t even mean love, just nearness and night.’) and distorted evading of the threat of bodily presence by pushing away and disheartening the woman haunting him and depriving him of his sleep: ’If you become involved with me, you will be throwing yourself into the abyss.’We see Kafka hiding behind his fear, his illness, his work, his demons in order not to meet Milena, Milena pressing him to meet, until eventually the relationship agrounds in despondency, and they must face there will not be a common future, never. During the frantic phase of exchanging letters, Kafka and Milena met in person only twice, four days in Vienna in June 1920, and one day in Gmünd, on the Austrian-Czech border, in August 1920. As the relationship proved without prospect, Milena not willing to leave her husband to come to live with Kafka in Prague, Kafka broke off the relationship, the letters continuing, less frequent, again more formal in tone, the time following. While Kafka later, on December 2, 1921 will write in his diary ‘Always Milena, or maybe not Milena, but a principle, a light in the darkness’, more darkness and despair creep into the letters: ‘I don’t believe the funny letters anymore. I almost said: I don’t believe any letters anymore, even the most beautiful ones always contain a worm’. (September 4, 1920)‘No one sings as purely as those who inhabit the deepest hell – what we take to be the song of angels is their song’. (August 26, 1920)‘It’s unfair to laugh at the lead singer in the opera who sings an aria while lying on the stage, mortally wounded. We lie on the ground and sing for years’. (September 1920)Numerous passages recount on Kafka’s notorious ‘fear’, a fear like a living animal caging Kafka, ranging far beyond the well-known fear of intimacy, commitment and being tied down. A fear that, as well as Milena’s marriage to Ernst Pollak, will at last come between them: 'Perhaps the logical conclusion is that we’re both married, you in Vienna, I to my fear in Prague ((July 21, 1920).' From these letters Kafka emerges not solely as an anxious and restless insomniac man on the edge, but as well as a witty, loving and playful human being bestowing his epistolary companion with endearing tenderness and affection, showing concern about her weal and woe, her health, her friendships, her – like his – equally difficult relationship with her father, her work, while at the same time exploring his own murky depths, ensuing in an enigmatic amalgamation of transparency and obfuscation, a blending of self-disclosure of his psyche as well as a delirious evocation of a ghostly inner world of delusions. 'Moreover, perhaps it isn’t love when I say you are what I love the most – you are the knife I turn inside myself, this is love.' 'The easy possibility of writing letters-from a purely theoretical point of view-must have brought wrack and ruin to the souls of the world. Writing letters is actually an intercourse with ghosts and by no means just with the ghost of the addressee but also with one's own ghost, which secretly evolves inside the letter one is writing or even in a whole series of letters, where one letter corroborates another and can refer to it as witness. How did people ever get the idea they could communicate with one another by letter! One can think about someone far away and one can hold on to someone nearby; everything else is beyond human power. Writing letters, on the other hand, means exposing oneself to the ghosts, who are greedily waiting precisely for that. Written kisses never arrive at their destination; the ghosts drink them up along the way. It is this ample nourishment which enables them to multiply so enormously. People sense this and struggle against it; in order to eliminate as much of the ghosts' power as possible and to attain a natural intercourse, a tranquility of soul, they have invented trains, cars, aeroplanes-but nothing helps anymore: These are evidently inventions devised at the moment of crashing. The opposing side is so much calmer and stronger; after the postal system, the ghosts invented the telegraph, the telephone, the wireless. They will not starve, but we will perish.' While apparently revealing in many respects, the letters mostly left me only more mystified on Kafka’s personality for which the epithet ‘convoluted’ maybe would be an understatement (if a Freudian reading of the Letters to Milena would take your fancy, try Kafka’s Letters to Milena and the Question of the Body by Shadi Neimneh). As I read both The trial and The Castle aeons ago, the connections between these intimate musings and his fictional work - like Felice Bauer is, according to Elias Canetti, central to the plot of The Trial, Milena – and her husband Ernst Pollak– will appear in The Castle – remain for me features still to explore, (maybe in a next life).Reading this was an overwhelming experience. Bemused by their fulgurant intensity, I couldn’t read this ardent and often painful letters but slowly, in spells, lost in the brilliant beauty of the sentences, their unexpected lyricism and tenderness, the sensuous and horrifying poetry of certain fragments. ‘And now my best regards after all – what does it matter if they collapse at your garden gate; perhaps your strength will be all the greater.’ On Christmas Day 1923, half a year before his death Kafka ended his correspondence to Milena with these last words. Arrested by the Gestapo for active resistance to Nazi occupation, Milena Jesenskà died in Ravensbrück on 17th May 1944, 47 years old.

Aren’t our eyes made to be torn out, and our hearts for the same purpose? At the same time it’s really not that bad; that’s an exaggeration and a lie, everything is exaggeration, the only truth is longing. But even the truth of longing is not so much its own truth; it’s really an expression for everything else, which is a lie. This sounds crazy and distorted, but it’s true. Moreover, perhaps it isn’t love when I say you are what I love the most - you are the knife I turn inside myself, this is love. This, my dear, is love.” Milena Jesenská was born in Prague, Austria-Hungary. In 1918 she married Ernst Pollak, a Jewish intellectual and literary critic whom she met in Prague's literary circles, and moved with him to Vienna. The marriage, which allegedly caused her to break off relations with her father for several years, was an unhappy one. In 1919 she discovered a short story (The Stoker) by Prague writer Franz Kafka, and wrote him to ask for permission to translate it from German to Czech. The letter launched an intense and increasingly passionate correspondence. Jesenská and Kafka met twice: they spent four days in Vienna together and later a day in Gmünd. Eventually Kafka broke off the relationship, partly because Jesenská was unable to leave her husband, and their almost daily communication ceased abruptly in November 1920. They meant so much to each other, however, that they did exchange a few more letters in 1922 and 1923 (and Kafka turned over to Jesenská his diaries at the end of his life). Jesenská's translation of The Stoker was a first translation of Kafka's writings into Czech (and as a matter of fact, into any foreign language); later she translated two other short stories by Kafka and also texts by Hermann Broch, Franz Werfel, Upton Sinclair, and many others. Jaroslav Dohal, the name given for the translator of the Czech edition of Kafka's short-story "Reflections for Gentlemen-Jockeys", is most likely a pseudonym for Jesenská. "The easy possibility of writing letters must have brought wrack and ruin to the souls of the world. Writing letters is actually an intercourse with ghosts, and by no means just the ghost of the addressee but also with one's own ghost, which secretly evolves inside the letter one is writing." The words in these letters are a haunting testament of longing and agony. The intense emotions that produced the ghostly poetry of Kafka's words are well documented here. This particular edition of Letters to Milena contains material previously omitted because of its extreme sensitivity. Also among the extended contents are:- Milena Jesenská's Letters to Max Brod- Four Essays by Milena Jesenská: 'Vienna', 'Letters of Notable People', 'A Dream', and 'The Devil at the Hearth'- Milena Jesenská's Obituary for Franz KafkaKafka died of laryngeal tuberculosis on 3 June 1924, aged 40, in a sanatorium in Kierling just outside Vienna.Arrested by the Gestapo for active resistance to Nazi occupation, Milena Jesenskà died in Ravensbrück on 17th May 1944, 47 years old.
7858656538	There are loves that were never meant to share a house, a table, a bed, or the routines of everyday life. They remind us that intimacy and connection can live in the spaces between words — never become real in the way we expect. But what does it mean to love from a distance? What remains afterward? What was once passion and love is now memory, an attempt at self-protection and resignation. Intense, contradictory, lyrical, and profoundly human, these letters disturbed me beyond my strength.Milena was the woman Kafka loved and needed. It was one of the greatest epistolary loves the world has ever known. He loved intensely, but with fear. Milena loved courageously, but with boundaries. Their universe knew no limits. He was in Prague, she in Vienna. So close, yet so far—they met only twice.Kafka was the anti-hero in love, and Milena, both mother and muse. Kafka exposed himself radically; Milena offered everything he felt he had never received. She did not judge him—she was the woman he had always waited for. Their letters replaced their bodies. They were opened, read, reread, and handled like kisses arriving by post. The experience of reading them was almost physical, and their meetings were awaited with both fear and longing.Each letter is a risk /charged with fear. There is the fear of loss, the need to give meaning even to what makes no sense—because everything is part of love.Kafka lived for his beloved and thanks her for having once stopped beside him and taken his hand. He, too, loved to hold her hand and look into her eyes—never speaking of the future again, only of the present. The letters are consumed to the last drop. The letters leave the lovers ten times stronger—and ten times thirstier. These letters didn’t just move me — they stayed forever.

6852744758	This book is everything I wanted to say but never could, until now.“It’s a long time since I wrote to you, Frau Milena, and even today I’m writing only as the result of an incident. Actually, I don’t have to apologize for my not writing, you know after all how I hate letters. All the misfortune of my life—I don’t wish to complain, but to make a generally instructive remark—derives, one could say, from letters or from the possibility of writing letters. People have hardly ever deceived me, but letters always—and as a matter of fact not only those of other people, but my own. In my case this is a special misfortune of which I won’t say more, but at the same time also a general one. The easy possibility of letter-writing must—seen merely theoretically—have brought into the world a terrible disintegration of souls. It is, in fact, an intercourse with ghosts, and not only with the ghost of the recipient but also with one’s own ghost which develops between the lines of the letter one is writing and even more so in a series of letters where one letter corroborates the other and can refer to it as a witness. How on earth did anyone get the idea that people can communicate with one another by letter! Of a distant person one can think, and of a person who is near one can catch hold—all else goes beyond human strength. Writing letters, however, means to denude oneself before the ghosts, something for which they greedily wait. Written kisses don’t reach their destination, rather they are drunk on the way by the ghosts. It is on this ample nourishment that they multiply so enormously. Humanity senses this and fights against it and in order to eliminate as far as possible the ghostly element between people and to create a natural communication, the peace of souls, it has invented the railway, the motor car, the aeroplane. But it’s no longer any good, these are evidently inventions being made at the moment of crashing. The opposing side is so much calmer and stronger; after the postal service it has invented the telegraph, the telephone, the radiograph. The ghosts won’t starve, but we will perish.”
201398307	« E dire che in fondo non amo te, ma piuttosto la mia esistenza che tu mi hai donata. »Nella primavera del 1920, la scrittrice boema Milena Jesenská legge i primi racconti di Kafka e gli scrive per chiedere di poterli tradurre in lingua ceca. Questo è l’inizio di un’appassionata corrispondenza che continuerà fino al 1923. La relazione fu per gran parte condotta attraverso lettere e la loro storia d’amore non ebbe mai un vero futuro. Fu Kafka a porre fine alla relazione. Dopo la sua morte, nel 1924, Milena scrisse in ricordo di lui « condannato a guardare il mondo con una chiarezza così accecante, lo trovò insopportabile e ne morì. »Nell’approcciarci a un’opera così fortemente auto-biografica come un carteggio, bisogna munirsi di occhiali e cappellino. Occhiali, per saper porre la giusta distanza tra sé e Franz e sempre ricordarsi, ‘tu non sei lui, lui è lui, tu non vuoi e non devi essere lui’. Cappellino, per proteggere la testa dai raggi ultravioletti della partecipazione emotiva, ‘tu non provi quello che provano loro, quello che provano loro lo provavano loro, perché sono persone che veramente hanno amato e si sono scritte’. Il rischio di ustione era alto: lo avevo già corso e ci ero sprofondata dentro con ‘Che tu sia per me il coltello’, che di questo è figlio e parricida. « E forse non è vero amore se dico che tu mi sei la cosa più cara; amore è il fatto che tu sei per me il coltello col quale frugo dentro me stesso ». Non volevo essere Franz e Milena come son stata Yair e Myriam, perché Yair e Myriam sono pur sempre creature di finzione, nelle quali è legittimo immedesimarsi, ma pretendere di capire le ragioni di Franz e le ragioni di Milena, pretendere di sentire quel che sentono loro è un delirio di onnipotenza e, come se non bastasse, è impossibile. La prova fondamentale del fatto che Franz e Milena si amassero consiste in questo: che si capivano. Pur utilizzando un mezzo imperfetto, un mezzo senza corpo come sono le parole, Franz e Milena si capivano, e questo è straordinario. Il lettore, invece, non capisce nulla, le date, le abbreviazioni, i sottointesi lo stordiscono. Vorrebbe entrare nella pagina e continuamente se ne sente respinto. Si chiede, ‘ma come poteva la povera Milena cavarci qualcosa da tutta questa confusione? come riusciva a sbrogliare il groviglio? che grimaldello usava?’. L’amore, usava l’amore, quell’amore che, una volta raggiunto un certo grado di intesa e di condivisione, necessita di mezzi di espressione così minimi, così fiacchi, da essere del tutto incomprensibili a un ascoltatore esterno. Franz e Milena si capivano perché pensavano alla stessa cosa, sempre alla stessa cosa, e pensavano alla stessa cosa perché amavano e, amandosi, erano l’uno e l’altra insieme. « Ieri ho sognato di te. Non ricordo più quasi i singoli fatti, so soltanto che di continuo ci trasformavamo l’uno nell’altro, io ero tu, tu eri io ». In una delle prime lettere, Franz definisce con un’immagine straordinaria il suo rapporto con Milena: « Credo, Milena, che noi due abbiamo una particolarità in comune: siamo tanto timidi e ansiosi, quasi ogni lettera è diversa, quasi ciascuna si spaventa della precedente, e, più ancora, della risposta. Lei non lo è per natura, lo si vede facilmente, e io, forse, nemmeno io lo sono per natura, ma ciò è quasi diventato natura, e si dilegua soltanto nella disperazione, tutt’al più nell’ira, e, da non dimenticare, nell’angoscia. Talora ho l’impressione che abbiamo una camera con due porte, l’una di fronte all’altra, e ognuno stringe la maniglia di una porta e basta un batter di ciglia dell’uno perché l’altro sia già dietro la sua porta e basta che il primo dica una sola parola, il secondo ha già certamente chiuso la porta dietro di sé e non si fa più vedere. Egli riaprirà, sì, la porta, perché si tratta di una camera che forse non si può lasciare. Se non fosse esattamente come il secondo, il primo starebbe tranquillo, preferirebbe, in apparenza, non guardare neanche verso il secondo, metterebbe lentamente in ordine la camera, quasi fosse una camera come qualunque altra, ma invece fa esattamente la stessa cosa presso la sua porta, talvolta persino tutti e due sono di là dalle porte e la bella camera è vuota. »È un’immagine spiazzante sulle prime. Ci si interroga su che cosa voglia dire. Ci ho pensato un po’ su e credo che voglia dire questo: una relazione come quella tra Franz e Milena è una versione raffinata del gioco del nascondino o del ‘uno, due, tre, stella!’. Per ogni passo avanti, se ne fanno dieci indietro. Per ogni ardore esposto, ce ne sono cento altri soffocati. Tuttavia, nonostante sia pieno di fastidi, nonostante metta in crisi l’uno e l’altra, il gioco non si può lasciare, va giocato tutto fino in fondo, finché uno dei due non fa ‘tana!’ o non arriva a toccare il muro gridando ‘stella!’. È un gioco sfibrante, perché il bambino non si allontana dal suo nascondiglio per paura di essere scoperto; viceversa, l’altro bambino non può allontanarsi dalla tana per non lasciarla sguarnita. Se non capitano incidenti nel mezzo, è un gioco che tende infinitamente a continuare. Il perché di queste oscillazioni tra il desiderio e il pudore va cercato nella personalità di Kafka. Franz è afflitto da un senso di colpa atavico, quasi razziale (l’ebreo che è in lui ruggisce a ogni cantone), che lo previene nei rapporti con l’altro, costringendolo a interagire a un livello sempre di inferiorità e di lordura. « Milena, non si tratta di questo, tu non sei per me una signora, sei una fanciulla, non ho mai visto nessuna che fosse tanto fanciulla, non oserò porgerti la mano, fanciulla, la mano sudicia, convulsa, unghiuta, incerta e tremula, cocente e fredda ». Per questo io non credo che da parte di Franz ci fosse della viltà, della paura per Milena, l’orrore del passo, il baratro sullo scalino, ma semplicemente una consapevolezza esasperata delle proprie mancanze, gonfiate dalla sua coscienza fino a essere l’unico orizzonte possibile. Non è che Kafka non allunghi la gamba per fare il passo: è che, nel suo masochismo ingenuo, pensa di non averla neanche una gamba. Ma la gamba ce l’ha e Milena la vede e noi sentiamo gli strattoni che dà, i pizzichi sul polpaccio, li sentiamo anche se di Milena non leggiamo nulla. Niente, tranne qualche inciso ingrato, incastonato nelle lettere di risposta. Milena, nella sua generosità di donna, vede, pazienta e sa. E soffre. E anche il lettore soffre e vorrebbe strillare e strattonare le sbarre della gabbia arrugginita che Franz s’è costruito intorno, ma c’è poco da macchinare: le difese sono tutte alzate, il nemico (il salvatore) non passerà. L’affievolirsi e poi lo spegnersi del carteggio è una naturale conseguenza derivata dalle premesse. Nella tortura auto-inflittasi e inflitta a Milena, Franz è un esecutore implacabile, logico, spietato, mai una deviazione dal regolamento. ‘Ho deciso che non posso essere felice? Così sia. Non posso essere felice neanche se la felicità mi sta a tre centimetri dalle dita. Ho deciso che felice non posso esserlo, se lo fossi tradirei me stesso, se tradisco me stesso sono perduto per sempre. E allora perché venir meno alla coerenza allungando le dita? Resti pure dove sta, questa felicità. Io non me la merito.’ È così terribile che viene voglia di fuggire. E fuggire bisogna. E cercare l’aria aperta. E respirare a pieni polmoni quel cielo pieno di possibilità che nessuno dovrebbe mai negare a se stesso. A che vale? La vita ci punisce tutti i giorni e tutti i giorni ci premia. Risparmiamo a noi stessi altre punizioni, ma non risparmiamoci mai altri premi. Post-scriptum: per dovere di cronaca, Franz e Milena si incontrarono più volte, sia nel sogno sia nella realtà. Cosa accadde durante questi incontri al lettore è lasciato soltanto immaginare. Se ne parla in più missive, ma mai in modo esplicito. Dopotutto, quel che accadde è affar loro, lo ricordavano bene, se lo ricordavano a vicenda. Non c’era davvero bisogno di darne una descrizione. Non sembra che questi incontri abbiano mai nociuto alla letterarietà della loro corrispondenza né che li abbiano in qualche modo disaffezionati. Semmai, tutto il contrario.
3192628398	Dear Franz,I hope you’ve finally found contentment wherever you are unlike when you were in this appalling world. It rather astounds me to read your letters to your love, Milena because they are the most private correspondence possible that I almost feel ashamed of having read them now. It’s as if getting to know a man beyond his grave so I felt morally bankrupt when I was done. The vulnerability with which you describe your feelings towards an obscure lover is not something that’s seeking empathetic eyes, but schlepping the preeminent essence of what we all possess: Insecurities.Oh, how valiantly you wear them, communicate them with utmost diligence and sincerity, I couldn’t help but fall in love at an instant!I had my first encounter with you when I accidentally stumbled upon one of your short stories, In The Penal Colony. The eerie of the story had me cracking my head over gathering all information about why you wrote what you wrote which still remains a mystery of sorts.The letters, the letters, Franz, they aren’t the most romantic ones but definitely real, so real that one cannot fail to feel your concern and the long-distance intimacy for your irreproachable lover. Oh, I understand the art and challenge of writing letters is as tiresome as beautiful. Words can be cruel, can be highly misunderstood, especially in letters that might get delayed or lost in transit. With each passing day along the timeline I could only grow fonder and feel a petulant non-satiable love with numerous uncertainties. My dear Franz, you were right, anyone who has loved this much is nothing short of selfish, and that is alright, there’s nothing like altruistic love. After all, only a desperate one knows how to give all the love and yearns for it in the same magnitudes in return.I left all my judgements in anticipation of the replies from the other side and also, because I know what it takes to love in distance. Wait manifests deep hunger but that turns a meal to a feast. Waiting comes with its rewards, that might be true but you sure know the crippling frustration of it, so I now wait for a letter which I know would never arrive.with love,a fellow yearning human

6183618883	https://kansasbooks.blogspot.com/2024..."¡A quién se le habrá ocurrido pensar que la gente podía relacionarse por correspondencia! Se puede pensar en una persona lejana y se puede tocar a una persona cercana, todo lo demás supera las fuerzas humanas. Pero escribir cartas significa desnudarse delante de espectros, cosa que ellos esperan ansiosos.”Me gusta el género epistolar aunque confieso que a veces se convierte en una lectura demasiado absorbente y cansada porque si se trata de cartas entre escritores, que es lo que me gusta, casi siempre hay un intento por mi parte por querer saber más sobre estos autores, leer entre lineas en caso de que anden mareando la perdiz con información innecesaria y doméstica sobre el día a día y a veces se convierte en una experiencia algo frustrante. No es éste el caso; Cartas a Milena me ha parecido una delicia por todo todo lo que estas cartas revelan sobre Kafka. Si alguien de verdad quiere saber más sobre este escritor, desde un lado completamente humano, yo le recomendaría estas cartas, siempre. Kafka, con la excusa de haber encontrado en Milena Jesenska a una persona que le entiende de verdad y con la que conecta desde el primer minuto, se desnuda emocionalmente en el sentido más íntimo sobre todo en lo que se refiere a esos miedos que arrastraba consigo como una cruz. Al final del libro hay unas cartas de la misma Milena dirigidas a Max Brod, en la que queda perfectamente patente, lo bien que ella llegó a conocerle en tan solo estos dos años de intercambio epistolar:“La cosa, no cabe duda, se presenta de la siguiente manera: todos, a lo que parece, somos capaces de vivir porque alguna vez nos refugiamos en la mentira, en la ceguera, en el entusiasmo, en el optimismo, en una convicción, en el pesimismo, o en lo que quiera que sea. Pero él nunca se ha refugiado en un asilo protector, en ninguno. Es absolutamente incapaz de de mentir, como es incapaz de emborracharse. Carece del menor refugio, no tiene techo. Por eso está a merced de todo aquello de lo que nosotros estamos resguardados. Es como un hombre desnudo entre gente vestida. Y ni siquiera es verdad todo lo que dice, todo lo que es y lo que vive. Es un modo de ser perfectamente determinado, que existe por sí mismo, despojado de todos los ingredientes que podrían ayudarle a configurar su vida: en la belleza o en la miseria, da igual."Franz Kafka y Milena Jesenska se conocen en 1920, él tenia 36 años y ya había sido diagnosticado por la enfermedad pulmonar que le llevó a la muerte unos pocos años después, en 1924. Conoció a Milena, que tenía 23 años y estaba casada en un matrimonio dependiente y problemático y casi desde un primer momento ella detectó en él al genio. La relación entre ellos comienza por el interés que se tomó ella en traducir al checo algunos de sus cuentos, y a partir de aquí, él en Praga y ella en Viena, con la excusa de estas traducciones, se establece uno de esos vinculos repentinos e inesperados. En una novela que leí hace poco de Fumiko Hayashi, se decía que uno no podía renegar de ciertos encuentros que eran como señales. Me acordé de esta cita porque realmente lo que ocurrió entre Milena y Kafka fue eso, y ellos supieron reconocerlo. “Allí en el andén, hubo un fenómeno que nunca había visto antes: luz del sol que no oscurece por una nube sino por sí sola. ¿Qué más voy a decir? La garganta no obedece, las manos no obedecen." La relación de esta serie de cartas empieza intercambiando impresiones sobre sus trabajos respectivos y poco a poco Kafka se fue revelando ante ella mostrándole sus sentimientos, sus miedos y sus pensamientos más íntimos, tanto que cuando él murió, ella tenía sus diarios. Kafka escribía sus cartas en alemán, mientras que Milena escribía la mayoría de las suyas en su lengua materna, el checo, así que estos textos lingüisticamente hablando son de una riqueza exquisita:“Entiendo el checo, por supuesto. Ya he querido preguntarle varias veces por qué no me escribe alguna vez en checo. Desde luego no porque usted no domine el alemán. Casi siempre lo maneja admirablemente, y cuando alguna vez no lo domina, el alemán se doblega ante usted por propia voluntad, eso es entonces lo más grato; eso, un alemán no se atreve a esperarlo de su idioma; no se atreve a escribir de un modo tan personal. Pero yo quería leer el checo que usted escribe porque es parte de usted, porque solo en él está Milena toda ella (la traducción lo confirma). Así que en checo, por favor.”La única pega que le pondría a estas cartas vendría de la parte de que solo tenemos el punto de vista de Kafka en lo que se refiere a su relación con Milena, porque las cartas de ella no se han conservado, sin embargo, se detecta por las cartas de Kafka el tipo de mujer que era Milena Jesenska: de personalidad desbordante y temperamento siempre vivo, periodista, traductora y escritora, que vivía en un conflictivo matrimonio con otro escritor que le causaba un enorme dolor y a la vez una enorme dependencia, que Kafka supo comprender desde el primer momento “Sí, hablar de tí con gente desconocida sí que puedo, y eso es también un placer exquisito.”. Yo diría que cada una de estas cartas son perfectas por lo que detectamos de él, sin esconderse, un auténtico muestrario del Kafka más íntimo, y la evolución desde la relación más comercial hablando de sus trabajos, pasando por lo que se fue convirtiendo en un vínculo de amistad hasta mostrar los sentimientos profundos que ambos se inspiraban, convierten esta "Cartas a Milena" en una maravilla. Kafka se expone “amor es que tú seas para mí el cuchillo con el que escarbo en mi interior” pero al mismo tiempo que lo hace, también está exponiendo sus miedos más profundos."Mi relación contigo sí la conozco. La conozco, en la medida en que no pertenece al terreno inabarcable del miedo, pero tu relación conmigo no la conozco, toda ella pertenece al miedo. Tú no me conoces tampoco, Milena, lo repito."[…]"Este cruce de cartas tiene que terminar, Milena, nos está volviendo locos, uno no sabe lo que ha escrito, ni a lo que tiene que responder, y, como quiera que sea, siempre está uno temblando. Tú checo lo entiendo muy bien, oigo también la risa, pero en tus cartas me muevo entre la palabra y la risa, luego solo oigo la palabra y por lo demás, todo mi ser no es sino miedo."Las primeras cartas comienzan dirigiéndose a ella como Señora Milena, y poco a poco, llegado un punto se dirige a ella como Milena, con una calidez que traspasa las páginas para finalmente acabar dirigiéndose a ella en las últimas cartas, de nuevo como Señora Milena. Las cartas se habían interrumpido abruptamente tras casi dos años de intercambio y cuando vuelven a retomar el contacto es ya desde una distancia, como la del inicio, pero quizás es en esta distancia, donde estuviera la verdadera esencia de la relación de ambos. No conozco mucho más de la vida de Kafka salvo lo habitual, no he leído ninguna biografía, pero yo diría que en estas cartas se nos muestra sin disfraces, con el lujo además de que a través de ellas el lector puede participar de la experiencia de ver cómo consiguieron establecer este vínculo estos dos, igual el secreto estuviera en que Milena Jesenska independientemente de su vida personal, estaba a la altura de este hombre frágil y fuerte al mismo tiempo. Una delicia. Suyo K."Sobre todo tenía tu telegrama en el bolsillo y con él se caminaba de un modo distinto. Por ejemplo, se acerca uno al puente, al Cechbrücke, saca el telegrama y lo lee (siempre es nuevo; cuando uno ha absorbido todo su contenido, el papel está vacío; pero una vez en el bolsillo, queda reescrito al momento)."♫♫♫ Six Page Letter - John Lee Hooker ♫♫♫

Iniziato mentre stavo ultimando la tesi di laurea, non riuscivo a dare la giusta attenzione a questo libro, tant’è che ho dovuto metterlo da parte e lasciarlo sul comodino per più di un anno. Quando ho finalmente deciso di riaprirlo, è stato come se lo leggessi per la prima volta. Ho pianto con Kafka, ho sofferto, mi sono immedesimata nel suo dolore e nei rari momenti di felicità, quando sapeva che avrebbe incontrato la sua amatissima Milena. Sono una raccolta di lettere che contengono le più intime confessioni di uno scrittore con il quale la vita non è stata clemente; ma è proprio da tutto questo dolore che sono nate tutte le opere che noi ben conosciamo.

4203472663	YouTube kitap kanalımda Milena'ya Mektuplar kitabını okumadan ölebilirsiniz dedim : youtu.be/FLNbCSjFh2I"Nasıl yani?! Bir Kafka kitabı ve 10 üzerinden 4 puan mı verilmiş? Ama iyi de bu nasıl mümkün olabilir ki?" diye soruyorsanız bu incelemeyi sonuna kadar okumayı unutmayın. Sonuna kadar okumayan bir sabah kendisini yatağında kocaman bir böceğe dönüşmüş olarak bulsun...Şimdi bu kitap öyle bir kitap ki, Kafka neredeyse her mektubun başında "Ah Milena, vah Milena" diye sayıkladığında aklıma sürekli Batman'in Robin'e attığı tokat geldi. Yani tam olarak şöyle: i.ibb.co/dfp740J/ahah1.jpg Gerçekten Kafka'nın artık biraz susmasını, Milena'yı darlamamasını ve kendi kurgularına bakmasını istediğim bu kitapta elbette harika cümleler de yok değil. Fakat çok muhtemel ki, 20.yy'daki Prag'da Tinder uygulaması henüz icat edilmediği için ve Kafka'nın da yalnızlık başına vurduğu için bu konuda birilerini darlama ihtiyacını Milena'ya yolladığı mektuplar üzerinden sağlamış gibi görünüyor. Bu kitapta Kafka o kadar sıkıntılı ve saplantılı bir aşk biçiminin içinde bulunuyor ki, bir süre sonra yurtdışındaki Posta ve Telgraf Teşkilatı'na gizlice sızıp Kafka'nın mektuplarının Milena'ya ulaşmasını engellemek istediğim bile oldu. Hatta şu alıntıyı örnek vermem yeterli bile olabilir bu sıkıntılı aşkı size özetleyebilmek için:"Ben bütün zamanımı ve bütün zamanımdan bin kat fazlasını ve daha da iyisi, dünya üzerinde var olan bütün zamanları senin için kullanmak istiyorum; seni düşünmek, senin içinde nefes almak için." [s. 111]BRUHH. Kendi görüşüme göre ne bütün zamanımı ne de bütün zamanımdan bin kat fazlasını, hatta ve hatta dünya üzerinde var olan bütün zamanları hak edecek bir insan bu dünya üzerinde yok. Çünkü Yusuf Atılgan'a göre de "Aylak Adam'ın aradığı gerçek sevgi bu dünyada yoktur"Eh peki hadi birisini bulduk diyelim, o zaman da evli olan bir kadına karşı bunları demezsin be Kafka... Yani bütün sosyal medya platformlarında hesap açıp da evli bekar fark etmeden her kadına yürüyen bir manyak tiplemesi gibi bir şey geliyor gözüme şu anda bu kitaba ve içindeki mektuplara baktığım zaman. "Sana da ne mesajlar geliyordur şimdi" temalı merakların katilisin be Kafka...Bu kitabın tek taraflı bir mektup süreci içermesinin sebebi muhtemelen Milena'nın Kafka'yı bir sosyopat olarak görmesi ve keşke mail'ın icat edildiği çağda yaşasaydım diye düşünmesinden dolayı olabilir. Eğer ki Kafka ve Milena şu an çağımızda yaşasaydı, Milena ilk fırsatta Kafka'nın mail'ını spam olarak işaretler ve e-posta listesindeki aboneliğini sonlandırırdı.Sonuç olarak evet, bu bir Kafka kitabı ve hatta ben de profil fotoğrafımda uzun zamandır Kafka'yı taşıyorum. Onun irrasyonel görüşlerini ve çağ hakkında yazdığı çıkmazları artık okumaktan öte içselleştirmiş ve kendi benliğimin uzantısına katmış biriyim. Fakat yine de, Kafka'nın mektuplarındansa kesinlikle kurgu kitaplarını tercih ederim diyen biriyim aynı zamanda. Dava'daki arayış sürecini ve bilinmeyenin peşinden gidilişi; Şato'daki görünen hedefe bir türlü ulaşamayış sürecini; Dönüşüm'deki yabancılaşmayı ve toplumun soyutlanmış insanlara karşı kayıtsız kalışını; öykülerinde ölüm, yaşam ve birey sorgulamalarını okumayı daha çok tercih ediyorum Kafka'nın. Bu incelemeyi sonuna kadar okuyup yarın sabah uyandığınızda kendinizi yatağınızda kocaman bir böceğe dönüşmüş olarak bulmamayı tercih ettiniz, umarım siz de bir gün yazdığınız mektuplarla bir insanı bu kitapta olduğu gibi darlamazsınız.
3674002901	“I am constantly trying to communicate something incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell about something I only feel in my bones and which can only be experienced in those bones. Basically it is nothing other than this fear we have so often talked about, but fear spread to everything, fear of the greatest as of the smallest, fear, paralyzing fear of pronouncing a word, although this fear may not only be fear but also a longing for something greater than all that is fearful.”Kafka is so dear to me.What i can't express,kafka expressed it before i was born. What i feel so intense even in my bones,Kafka felt it long ago. And through these letters between Kafka and his lover Milena i got the opportunity to look beyond the writer Kafka and into the abyss of the human Kafka. At the end of this book,Milena questioned in one of her essay why we try to understand an artist apart from his work? She explained it herself that we,humans are never satisfied with a work of art,we try to understand the art behind that artist,we endlessly strive to fathom the fact why that particular artists could discover that particular art; thus we create a fantasy of how a great writer should look and behave...but in reality most of the time they are like every ordinary person,even more unclear or suppressed than any ordinary person. This same intention gets in play when we start to read this book. As these are letters about Kafka's personal affair and life,we subconsciously sometimes feel insecure and exited at the same time as we get know him deep down,as well as his anxiety, loneliness,depression etc. Though we can only understand the depth of Kafka and Milena's relationship through letters only,yet there is no chance that you won't be surprise to feel the strange and profound structure of that relationship. How deeply a person can understand another person! Yet there are some things which can't be explained and this is the reason of Kafka's mental agony,maybe even the reason behind his greatest work.

Sarebbe stato stupendo leggere anche le lettere di Milena a Kafka..L’ho trovato affascinante poichè all’inizio del libro si denota un Kafka molto delicato anche nel farle i complimenti, senza osare troppo. “[..] bene, allora sono io in collera con Lei per questo punto, è bene che in un angolo del cuore ci sia pronta per Lei un po di collera.”Metà libro frasi stupende piene d’amore, di poesia, immaginazione.Verso la fine, quando realizza che non ci potrà essere nessun futuro tra i due, chiede di non scriverle più; sentirsi sempre fa male e lo destabilizza. “[..]e sarà bene che non parliamo mai più dell’avvenire ma soltanto del presente.”“[..] ora è molto meglio non scriversi ogni giorno; tu in segreto l’hai capito prima di me. Le lettere quotidiane indeboliscono invece di rinforzare; prima bevevo la lettera fino in fondo e nello stesso tempo acquistavo dieci volte più forza e dieci volte più sete. Adesso invece la situazione è molto seria, adesso leggendo la lettera mi mordo le labbra e niente è sicuro come questo leggero dolore nelle tempie.”Per arrivare verso la fine delle lettere che la chiama «Signora Milena» prendendo distanze.Grazie a questo libro ho potuto conoscere una sfaccettatura nuova di Kafka. Confermo nel dire che se fosse vivo, mi starebbe un sacco simpatico!

Kapıyı tekrar açacak, çünkü bu belkide insanın terk edemediği bir oda. ilki ikincisine bu kadar benzemese, sakin olsa, ötekine bakmıyormuş gibi davransa, odayı sanki herhangi bir odaymış gibi yavaş yavaş düzene sokacak, ama bunun yerine, o da kapısının orada aynı şeyi yapıyor, hatta bazen ikisi de kapılarının arkasına saklanıyorlar ve güzelim oda bomboş kalıyor. işte bu yüzden, üzücü yanlış anlamalar ortaya çıkıyor." 52"İnsan, Milena, sizin yüzünüzü avuçları arasına almalı ve dosdoğru gözlerinizin içine bakmalı ki, karşınızdakinin gözlerinde kendinizi görüp o andan itibaren o yazdıklarınızı değil yazmak, düşünemeyecek hale gelesiniz." 56"Yine de sizi özlediğimi söylesem yalan olur; bu olup olabilecek en eksiksiz en acı verici büyü: Buradasınız, tıpkı benim gibi, hatta benden fazla; benim olduğum yerde siz de varsınız, üstelik benden daha fazla varsınız." 57"Sanki bir hafta boyunca hiç ara vermeden bir taşa çivi çakmakla görevlendirilmişim gibi; üstelik işçi de, çivi de bizzat benim. Milena!" 58"Bu kadar soru yeter, ne güzel bilinçaltında uyuyorlardı, neden gün ışığına çıkarılsınlar? Hepsi karanlık ve acı dolu; insanı da öyle yapıyorlar." 60"Bunun sizi benden soğutmasına izin vermeyin. Sadece rüyalarda bu kadar tekinsizim."66"Üçüncü bir yolda ilerlemek istiyorum: sana ya da ona değil, yalnızlığa çıkan yolda." 67"Nasıl bu mektupla fırtına gibi içeri girdiysen, aynı şekilde pencereden uçup gitmek istemen için dua ediyorum." 71"Biliyor musun Milena, ona gittiğinde, büyük bir adım atarak bulunduğun zeminden aşağı inmiş oldun, bana geldiğindeyse boşluğa atlıyorsun." 72"Bir ay önce daha iyi bir insan değil miydim? senin için endişeleniyordum (yine de ancak içten içe), hastalığını biliyordum, şimdiyse hiçbir şey kalmadı, şimdi sadece kendi hastalığım ve sağlığımı düşünüyorum ve aslında ikisi de, ilki de ikincisi de, sensin."73"Dünyada benim ihtiyaç duyduğum kadar sabır var mı Milena?" 89"Bugün Milena, Milena, Milena–başka bir şey yazmayacağım. Hayır yazacağım. Bugün Milena, sadece telaş, yorgunluk ve yokluğun var (ama sonuncusu yarın da olacak). Tamamen iyileşmemekte haksız mıyım? Haksız mıyım Milena? (Sen yoksul yatağında haklı bir nedenle derin bir uykudayken ve yavaş yavaş, farkında bile olmadan sağdan sola, dudaklarıma doğru dönerken, sol kulağına söylüyorum bunları.)" 91"...kulağımda bir ses çınlıyor: 'O artık yanında değil", buna karşılık gökyüzünde bir yerlerde daha güçlü bir başka ses var ve o da şöyle çınlıyor: "Seni terk etmeyecek"; ama işte zayıf ses kulağımın dibinde." 94"Bunu kıskançlıktan söylemiyorum Milena, kıskanç değilim. Ya dünya çok küçük ya da biz çok büyüğüz, ne olursa olsun onu tamamen dolduruyoruz. Kimi kıskanacağım ki?" 102"...bazen bana öyle geliyor ki, birlikte yaşamak yerine, ölmek üzere mutlu mesut yan yana uzanacağız. Fakat ne olacaksa senin yanında olacak." 119"Mesela, neden odanda duran ve senin koltukta ya da çalışma masasının başında oturuşunu, uzanışını, uyuyuşunu seyreden mutlu dolap değilim?" 123"Sana neredeyse yalvariyorum, gelme! Bırak, birgün çok gerektiğinde gelmeni istersem hemen geleceğin umuduyla yasayayim; ama şimdi gelme nasıl olsa geri dönmek zorunda kalacaksın." 132"...bir kez olsun bana kendimden kurtulup derin bir nedes alma zevkini tattır." 138"...tek istediğim, yüzümü kucağına koymak, başımın üzerinde dolaşan elini hissetmek ve sonsuza dek öyle kalmak..." 140"Hayır, hep gülmedim. Bavul taşıman konusunda söyleyecek söz bulamıyorum, buna inanamıyorum, inandığımda gözümde canlandıramıyorum, canlandırdığımdaysa 'pazar günkü' kadar güzelsin." 146"Böylece büsbütün koptuk birbirimizden Milena ve görünüşe bakılırsa, bütün gücüyle tek bir ortak isteğimiz var: senin burada olman ve yüzünün benimkine olabildiğince yakın durması." 150"...ama sen zavallı, tatlı Milena, suçluluk duygusuyla ne kadar çok işi yükleniyorsun, seni eğilmiş çalışırken görüyorum, boynun çıplak, arkanda duruyorum, farkında değilsin -lütfen dudaklarımı ensende hissettiğin zaman korkma, niyetim öpmek değildi, bu sadece çaresizlik içindeki aşk-..." 166"Hem ben ayrıca 55 kilo 400 gramım! El ele tutuşsak, nasıl uçup gidebilirim? Peki ya ikimiz birden uçup gitsek ne olur ki?" 168"...belki de bütün bunlar yalnızca, sarılmak için bulunmuşş az çok iyi bir bahane." 179"...ne olursa olsun zaten yoldayız, kalkıp gitmenin ötesinde bir şey gelmiyor elimizden." 181"Üstelik -bir akşam, her şeyin mümkün olduğunu, sadece seni kaybetmemin mümkün olmadığını yazmıştın-" 190"Bütün dünyayı seviyorum, senin sol omzun da dahil buna, hayır, önce sağ omzundu ve o yüzden onu canım istedikçe öpüyorum (sen de bluzunun o kısmını açacak kadar iyisin.) ve sol omzun da buna dahil." 200"Kirliyim ben Milena, sonsuz kirli, o yüzden temizlik konusunda böylesine yaygara ediyorum. Hiç kimse cehennemin dibindekiler kadar temiz şarkı söyleyemez; meleklerin söylediğini sandığımız şarkı, aslında onlarınkidir." 224"Sana bir keresinde bahsettiğim hiçlik rüzgarına kapıldım" 254"...insan bazen erken kalktığında gerçeğin hemen yatağın yanı başında olduğuna inanır: üzerinde birkaç solmuş çiçekle bir mezar, açık, içine almaya hazır." 255"İnsan kendi eksikliğine katlanmak zorundadır, her an için; oysa iki kişilik eksikliğe katlanmak zorunda değildir." 257"...sadece gece onun için savaşır ama zaten gece her şey için savaşır." 264"...çok iyi tanıdığımız, yokluğunu çok hissettiğimiz ve o yüzden en güzel adlarla çağırdığımız birini arıyorduk ama cevap gelmiyordu, nasıl cevap gelebilirdi ki, orada değildi, ufukta bile görünmüyordu." 268"...yaşamaya bir süre daha devam etmeye karar veriyor, en azından bir öğle sonrası boyunca..." 279"...ben 'kendi bahçe parmaklığımın üstünden'bakmıştım, yalnızca ellerimle onun tepesine tutunmuş, sonra da yara bere içinde ellerle gerisingeri düşmüştüm." 282"Umudun olmadığını söylüyorsun ama benden tamamen kurtulmak gibi bir umudun var." 290"Bazen-rüyada değil- şöyle bir şey canlandırıyorum gözümde: Saçların yüzünü örtmüş, onları ikiye ayırıyor, sağdan ve soldan arkaya atıyorum. Yüzün ortaya çıkıyor, elimi alnında ve şakaklarında gezdiriyor ve yüzünü ellerimin arasında tutuyorum." 292"...neticede sabırlı olmak mecburiyetindesiniz, bu tomurcuk yavaş yavaş açar ve tomurcuk olmasının tek nedeni, kapalı olana tomurcuk denmesi." 304

2829307024	كتابة الرسائل لحظات من تلاقي الأطياف ، فهي استحضار لطيف المتلقي و طيف المرسل ليتجسدا في كلمات الرسالة . و قراءة الرسائل لا تقل قدسية عن كتابتها ، فأنت حين تقرأ تستحضر أرواح من هاموا بين السطور و غرقوا في الدواة و الحروف ، الذين تآلفوا على الورق و خبأوا أنبل القصص في تلك الظروف البريدية .يكتب كافكا : منذ سنوات لم أخاطب روحاً ، و فيه يختزل حاجة إنسان قلق .. منعزل .. ضعيف إلى من يؤنس وحشته و يودع فيه خلاصة سنوات من الوحدة و اليأس و الخوف الدائم .و شخصية عميقة و حالمة ككافكا ، عانت من وحدة نفسية و قلق كبير من سوء الفهم ، أبقته في توق محموم إلى الانسجام الفكري ومساحة التفهم التي أغدقته به ميلينا ، فهو يكتب لها : ساعديني ميلينا ، حاولي فهمي أكثر مما تعبر الكلمات .أنا أحدّث نفسي من خلالك . مجرد أن أكتب لك يهدأ عقلي . و كان لكلمات ميلينا الأثر الكبير في حياة كافكا ، فقد وجد فيها الهدوء و السكون الذي ابتغاه ، و القوة التي تمنحه الحياة و تمده بالقدرة على اجتياز أيامه ، حتى وصف الرسائل بأنها تُنزل المطر على رأسه المحترق ، و كتب لها أيضاً : شكراً لك على تلك الكلمات التي تدخل مجرى دمي فوراً .و بعد شوط من الرسائل يظهر جلياً تعلق كافكا بميلينا ، و هو ما كان حتمياً لإنسان حساس تخبط أعواماً في عزلته ثم عثر على من يدق قوقعته و يبث النور في حياته البائسة ، فيدوّن كافكا بأسلوب عذب و مرهف تعلّقه بميلينا و ولعه بها : المرء لا يستطيع الحياة من دون خفقان قلبه ، فكيف لقلبي أن يخفق و أنت بعيدةً عنه ! لا يمكن للعقل أن يستوعب كيف يمكن لك أن تكوني بمثل هذا البعد ! للأسف ، الحياة لم تكن كريمة مع كافكا ، فالشرارة التي اندلعت في صندوق البريد انطفأت في حياة الواقع ، و بين زواج ميلينا و مرض كافكا عاد الخوف و القلق يرتعان في حياة كافكا و عمّ اليأس مراسلاته ، فكان معزولاً ، بعيداّ كل البعد عن السلام ، تتقاذفه الخواطر ، و ما انفك يهجو البعد و يرثي اللقاء و يستسلم للخوف أيما استسلام ، فيكتب : يا ليتك كنت هنا الآن ، فأنا لا أحد لي ، لا أحد عدا الخوف .يبني المرء حياته على شخص واحد و لهذا يبدأ الخوف ، ليس الأمر و كأنني أخافك ، لكن الخوف من هلاك الحياة التي آملها معك .أشعر بجسدي خائفاً و كأنه يزحف إلى أعلى الحائط بعيداً عن هذه المقاييس التي تشكل العالم . تنتهي حياة كافكا و ينتهي معها هذا التخاطب الروحي ، و بسبب اتلافه لرسائل ميلينا نفقد الكثير من تسلسل الأفكار و جمال المراسلة و يبقى لنا فقط ما خطته ميلينا بعد موت كافكا ، فوضعت النقطة الأخيرة و كأنها تضع شاهدة قبر على ما أحيته الحروف و دُفن على آخر سطور الرسائل : توفي قبل أمس كافكا ، قلة هم من يعرفونه لأنه كان منعزلاً ، حكيمًا يهاب الحياة ، كان خجولاً وطيّباً ، لكن الكتب التي كتبها قاسية و موجعة ، هو أحكم من أن يعيش ، و أضعف من أن يقاوم ، لكن ضعفه هو ضعف أولئك المرهفين العاجزين عن مواجهة الخوف و سوء الفهم .

7039660913	As Milena herself says in her essay "Letters of Notable People": "We do not expect any art from letters; we expect something human." And these letters are so painfully human. There is a deep yearning I felt with the knowledge that we only have half of this correspondence. A piece of this pain is abated, while another piece is deepened with the appendices: letters from Milena to Max Brod, four of Milena's essays as discussed in the letters, and Franz Kafka's obituary, written by Milena. The appendix gives a glimpse into the woman that Milena was, specifically in regard to Franz, and adds some clarity to an already clear picture of the love they shared, though it was rarely in person. Love, in it's purest form, is not something that has a prerequisite. There were things both of them wanted that neither of them could give the other, however that did not stop them for having infinite love and affection towards the other. They respected each other's wishes and loved with as much time as they had. Something about that is especially beautiful. That understanding, that lack of blame towards the other, that "I will love you anyways, in whatever capacity our situations allow." It is infinitely more potent because it withstands so much stress. And I suppose it is infinitely more tragic too, but hopefully in another life... This is known pretty widely as a book of yearning, and a very large part of it is so exquisitely that. However there is another part of this, that is just as raw and is where that yearning stems from. In Milena Jesenská, Kafka was understood fully for maybe the first time in his life. Is there anything as powerful as that? Is there any connection that reigns stronger? Between the yearning, there is something sacred. There is Kafka laying himself bare to someone he fully trusts and believes has the capability to fully understand him. Likewise, when reading Milena's letters to Max Brod about Kafka, we see her love, but, most importantly, we see her raw essence and, after only having a picture of her through Kafka's words, it is potent to see her own words. Kafka is one of my top two most relatable authors, and the way he delves into alienation and isolation through metaphor is what makes him share that top spot with Lispector. I would probably feel more inclined to psychoanalyze why that is (as I have done with Lispector), but Kafka has one very important thing in common with me: our birthdays. So I will just choose to push aside that in depth analysis of both me and a long dead author who I'm probably projecting onto and say that all people born on July 3rd are just built like this. [Congratulations on your constant feeling of a wall between you and the rest of the world if you are also a July 3rd baby, you deserve it!] It is clear that Kafka's tendency towards solitude gave him incredibly deep insights about himself, allowing him to view himself through a lens that, while his distinct feeling of otherness and alienation from the rest of the world does kind of teeter on self-hatred, his remarks feel like that of a third-party observer. While these remarks do give insights on his works, the vulnerable comments he shares with Milena, those where he is truly yearning for someone to understand his soul fully and believes, even if just for a foolish second, that he will find some kind of almost-salvation in her understanding. It is no wonder she was his first translator. These letters are a nonfiction tragedy and the realization of that bubbled up quite quickly near the end. The crux of them not being together is that Milena does not leave her husband, who she is eternally unhappy with and who constantly cheats on her (yes, she's also cheating, only with one person, but the number isn't what matters-this was to even the playing field, not indite one) and Kafka is trapped by fear and his illness. Very early on, Milena writes to Max with 100% certainty that Franz will die from his Tuberculosis because his nature is fundamentally against that of the world and he cannot adapt. I would call this tragically poetic and prophetic, however a specter of John Green is standing behind me, shaking Everything is Tuberculosis, so the logical science-y side of me will overrule the creative mystical side. That being said, the truth is that Kafka was dying of Tuberculosis when he met Milena. He survived 3 more years but he was dying. And one has to wonder how much of Milena's unwillingness to leave her husband was because of her absolute certainty that Franz would die soon. And how much of Kafka's self-abasement was due to the knowledge that, if she left her successful husband he, who had such a difficult time existing tangibly in the world, would not be fully capable of providing what she needed and then would eventually die, leaving her. So, while the love story is perhaps tragic, it is also perhaps significantly less so than it could have been because they both allowed themselves to feel the love they had for each other, even if their "marriages" (Milena's real, Franz's to fear) separated them physically. Milena "the only thing I could say was that next to you everything else--even if it hasn't changed in itself--disappears and turns to nothing." "Either the world is so tiny or else we are so gigantic; in any case we fill it completely. Of whom should I be jealous?" "You have a certain peculiarity--I believe it comes from deep inside your being, and someone else is at fault if it isn't always effective--which I have never seen in anyone else, and which I can't even imagine, although I have found it in you. It is your inability to make other people suffer. Not out of pity, but just because you can't." "Incidentally, I have such faith in you concerning this that I don't even want any miracles to occur; I calmly entrust you to the forest, lake, and to the food, you who are miraculous by nature, violated and inviolable." "And that's why you're right in saying we were already one and I'm not afraid of this; on the contrary, it is my only happiness and my only pride and I don't at all restrict it to the forest." "Fortunately no congratulations are necessary, just a thank you for being on this Earth, where I wouldn't have even begun to expect you might be found." "I keep wanting to hear a different sentence than you did, this one: 'You're mine.' And why that one in particular? It doesn't even mean love, just nearness and night." "... that I am living for you, that I am allowed to do so, and that, in this way, I am beginning to thank you for the fact that you once stopped beside me and gave me your hand." "And of course it's blasphemous to build so much on another person, and that's why the fear starts to converge around the foundation, but it's not so much the fear about you as the fear that such constructions are dared at all. And that's also why your lovely human face has so much of the divine (although it was probably already there to begin with.)" "You were so good, I crouched down beside you as if it were my right, I laid my face in your hand, I was so happy, so proud, so free, so mighty, so much at home, again and again: so much at home--but in essence I remained a mere animal, just part of the forest, living in the open only by your grace. I was reading my destiny inside your eyes without knowing it (since I had forgotten everything)." " 'If only I could take her with me!' and the counterthought: 'But can there be any darkness where she resides?' " "Moreover, perhaps it isn't love when I say you are what I love the most--you are the knife I turn inside myself, this is love." "I'm not saying goodbye. There isn't any goodbye, unless gravity, which is lying in wait for me, pulls me down entirely. But how could it, since you are alive." internal "You aren't tired at all, just restless, just afraid of taking one step on this Earth teeming with pitfalls, which is why you always keep both feet in the air at once, you aren't tired, just afraid of the terrible fatigue which will follow this terrible restlessness and which may--at best--be visualized as sitting in the garden of the insane asylum behind Karlsplatz, staring into space like an idiot." "Sometimes I feel as though I had lead weights so heavy they're bound to pull me down into the deepest sea in a minute, and anyone who wanted to grab me or even 'save' me would just let me go, not out of weakness or even desperation, but simply out of sheer annoyance." "Everybody is so eternally alive, truly immortal, perhaps not in the direction of true immortality, but down to the depths of their immediate life. I'm so afraid of them." "I had been looking 'over my fence,' holding myself up with just my hands, and then I fell back down, my hands completely lacerated. There must be other shared possibilities, the world is full of possibilities, only I still don't know what they are." "Not one second of calm has been granted me; nothing has been granted me, everything must be earned, not only the present and future, but the past as well--something which is, perhaps, given every human being--this too much be earned, and this probably entails the hardest work of all." "It's a little as if instead of just having to wash up, comb one's hair, etc.; before every walk--which is already difficult enough--a person is constantly missing everything he needs to take with him, and so each time he has to sew his clothes, make his boots, manufacture his hat, cut his walking stick, etc. Of course it's impossible to do all of that well; it may hold up for a few blocks, but then suddenly, at the Graben, for example, everything falls apart and he's left standing there naked with rags and pieces. ... I'm not saying such a man is lost, not at all, but he is lost the minute he goes to the Graben where he is a disgrace to himself and the world." "I keep trying to convey something which cannot be conveyed, to explain something which cannot be explained, something in my bones, which can only be experienced in these same bones." "This is neither my defect nor one of other people. It's just that I belong in the quietest quiet, that's what's right for me." "I once envied someone very much because he was loved, well cared-for, guarded by reason and strength, and because he lay peacefully under flowers. I'm always quick to envy." "And now my 'best regards' after all--what does it matter if they collapse at your garden gate; perhaps your strength will be all the greater." external "everything is exaggeration, the only truth is longing, which cannot be exaggerated." "Perhaps their strength to love consists solely in their ability to be loved." "One can think about someone far away and one can hold on to someone nearby; everything else is beyond human power." Milena Letters to Brod "No, this whole world is and remains a riddle to him. A mystical secret. Something he cannot attain and something he holds in high regard, with a moving, pure naïveté, because it is 'good at business.' " "But he [Franz] has never fled to any refuge, not one. He is absolutely incapable of lying, just as he is incapable of getting drunk. He lacks even the smallest refuge; he has no shelter. That is why he is exposed to everything we are protected from. He is like a naked man among the dressed. Everything he is, says, and lives cannot even be called truth; actually, it is predetermined being, being in and of itself, being with nothing added that might allow him to distort his picture of the world--whether into beauty or distress. And his asceticism is completely unheroic--hence all the greater and loftier. All 'heroism' is lying and cowardice. This is not someone who chooses asceticism as a means to an end; here is a man who is forced to be ascetic because of his terrible clairvoyance, his purity and inability to compromise." "I have, however, an insuppressible longing, a maniacal longing for a completely different life than the one I am leading now or ever will lead, a longing for a life with a child, for a life that would be very close to the earth. And this is what probably won out over everything else inside me, over love, over my love of taking flight, over my admiration, and one again over love." "I know he isn't resisting life, just this type of life." Letters of Notable People "Of course there was a Hamlet before Shakespeare and a Myshkin before Dostoyevsky, and the earth was turning before Galileo, and there was electricity before Galvani. But the world didn't know that; the world was unaware of electricity and went without it. It didn't count on it and didn't suppose it existed. Just like it didn't know a Hamlet before Shakespeare or an Onegin before Pushkin. That is the artist's possession: his exclusive worldview. His ability to see something for the first time, to see something new." "But as long as we are not quite so perfect, as long as the statement alone does not suffice for faith and understanding, as long as we must place our fingers in the wounds, like Thomas, we have the right to convince ourselves the wounds exist, and that they are deep." The Devil at the Hearth "Or do you really think a home is something else and serves purposes other than protecting, protecting, and once again protecting people from the world and mainly from their own inner reflection?" "I think it would be much more difficult to promise what can be kept, and then live up to such a promise. All fantastic talk from the depths of one's soul is only an excuse; it won't survive the first truly difficult situation that demands simply that people act with human decency." "There are two ways to live: you can either accept your fate, make up your mind and cope with it, get to know your fate and bind yourself to its good sides and bad, to happiness and unhappiness, bravely, honestly, without bargaining, generously and humbly. Or you can seek your fate: but the search will not only consume your strength, time, illusions, instinct, and any proper, benevolent blindness; it will also consume your self-esteem. You will become poorer and poorer, because what lies ahead is always worse than what you had. Besides, seeking requires faith, and faith may require more strength than life." Milena's Obituary for Kafka "They [Kafka's works] are full of dry scorn and the sensitive perspective of a man who saw the world so clearly that he couldn't bear it, a man who was bound to die since he refused to make concessions or take refuge, as others do, in various fallacies of reason, or the unconscious--even the noble ones." "All of his books paint the horror of secret misunderstandings, of innocent guilt between people. He was an artist and a man of such anxious conscious the could hear even when others, def, felt themselves secure."

3380363285	Oh dear god! What do I say about this book? I can't seem to find the right words! Its just so so beautiful that it makes you want to smile, laugh and cry at the same time. The book could have gotten boring easily, but it didn't! That's the beauty of Kafka's writing. Plus, his letters and feelings are so raw and beautiful. Letters that resonated with me, letters which touched me, letters in which he has bared his soul, letters written in prose but feels like poetry. Finally, some quotes for you -You are the knife I turn inside myself; that is love. That, my dear, is love.Sometimes I have the feeling that we're in one room with two opposite doors and each of us holds the handle of one door, one of us flicks an eyelash and the other is already behind his door, and now the first one has but to utter a word ad immediately the second one has closed his door behind him and can no longer be seen. He's sure to open the door again for it's a room which perhaps one cannot leave. If only the first one were not precisely like the second, if he were calm, if he would only pretend not to look at the other, if he slowly set the room in order as though it were a room like any other; but instead he does exactly the same as the other at his door, sometimes even both are behind the doors and the the beautiful room is empty.And don't demand any sincerity from me, Milena. No one can demand it from me more than I myself and yet many things elude me, I'm sure, perhaps everything eludes me.I am constantly trying to communicate something incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell about something I only feel in my bones and which can only be experienced in those bones. Basically it is nothing other than this fear we have so often talked about, but fear spread to everything, fear of the greatest as of the smallest, fear, paralyzing fear of pronouncing a word, although this fear may not only be fear but also a longing for something greater than all that is fearful.I’m thinking only of my illness and my health, though both, the first as well as the second, are you.

7240033235	Dragostea prin ochii lui Kafka este una tumultuoasă, egoistă și profundă, marcată, desigur, de spaimele specifice autorului și de ipohondria sa, care stă la baza multora dintre scrierile sale, inclusiv a "Metamorfozei" (așa cum am aflat din acest articol, pe care îl recomand: https://aeon.co/essays/the-role-of-hy...). "[...] nici nu te iubesc totuși, ci mai degrabă îmi iubesc existența pe care tu mi-ai dăruit-o."Așa se poate rezuma dragostea lui Kafka pentru Milena, traducătoarea sa.
5219380495	I give it 5 stars because I love reading letters and this collection is one of my most favorite! But I believe that this (and this type of writings) is not for everyone so you might want to check with yourself first if you enjoy reading letters that you have no business doing so (or perhaps writing letters yourself?). Like yes I love it, would definitely love to hype you to read it as well but, yea, I don’t think it’s for everyone.

1523930778	“Hacía mucho que no le escribía, Frau Milena, y hoy mismo sólo le escribo por casualidad. No hay necesidad de que me disculpe por mi silencio, usted sabe cómo odio las cartas. Toda la desdicha de mi vida proviene, si se quiere, de las cartas o de la posibilidad de escribirlas. Y con esto no me quiero quejar, sino formular una observación instructiva. Muy pocas veces me ha engañado una persona; las cartas siempre me engañan. Y no sólo las de otros, sino también las mías. […] ¡A quién se le ocurrió que la gente puede mantener relaciones por correspondencia! Uno puede pensar en una persona ausente y puede tocar a una persona presente; todo lo demás supera las fuerzas humanas. Pero escribir cartas significa desnudarse ante los fantasmas, cosa que ellos aguardan con avidez. Los besos escritos no llegan a destino, son bebidos por los fantasmas en el camino. Y esa abundante alimentación hace que los fantasmas se multipliquen en forma tan desmesurada.”En Le feu follet, Alain Leroy confiesa que su desesperación existencial proviene de la incapacidad de establecer un contacto real con el mundo y los otros.“No les quiero, nunca he podido quererlos. No puedo extender mis manos, no puedo tocar, no puedo asir” dice. “Me hubiera gustado tanto ser amado, que creo que amo.”Por ese motivo decide poner fin a su vida. Para Leroy, la idea de amar es más verdadera que la presencia material de las cosas, más real que el objeto amado.Cuando Milena Jesenská descubre los escritos de Kafka, decide traducirlos al checo. Él, aplacado por ese acto de comprensión, le corresponde con un universo epistolar de confidencias en el que ambos se cobijan: literatura. Es todo lo que puede dar.“La lluvia, que ha durado dos días y una noche, acaba de cesar, probablemente sólo de modo provisional; sin embargo es un acontecimiento digno de celebrarse, y yo lo celebro escribiéndole.”Sabe que quien le lee no sólo le comprende, sino que le compadece. Sabe por tanto que puede hablar empleando el mismo idioma con el que ve y siente. Encuentra un lugar perfecto para depositar sus sueños.“El día es cortísimo; con usted y luego con algunas cosas sin importancia, ya se ha pasado y se ha terminado. Apenas queda un ratito para escribir a la Milena verdadera, porque la aún más verdadera ha estado aquí todo el día, en la habitación, en el balcón, en las nubes.”“Qué fácil será la vida cuando estemos juntos —¡cómo escribo sobre ello, idiota de mí!”¿Cómo entender que Kafka y Milena, pese a su complicidad hipnótica y a escribirse a corazón abierto durante años, sólo compartieron cuatro días en Viena, y unas pocas horas en Gmünd, semanas después? Su relación nunca llegó a materializarse fuera del papel.La negativa de Milena a dejar a su marido, Ernst Pollack, pese a sus continuas infidelidades, se considera uno de los posibles motivos, y es el que ella misma se achaca en una postrera carta dirigida a Max Brod. Sin embargo es Franz quien, a partir del encuentro en Viena, —al cual, paradójicamente, se refiere como uno de los momentos más felices de su vida— encuentra infinitos impedimentos para verse de nuevo.Kafka, como había ocurrido con Felice, no concibe unificar el mundo real y el imaginario. Las constantes referencias a un miedo que le impide avanzar —surgidas tras el encuentro de Viena— no son más que un símbolo a través del cual presenta esta imposibilidad, y describen su alma quebrándose ante la mera idea de entregarse. En ese miedo, ella es causa y remedio, pues paradójicamente necesita que siga estando al otro lado de sus cartas, como fantasma que evocar.“Hay una sola cosa, Milena, que no puedo soportar sin tu explícita ayuda: el «miedo», para eso soy demasiado débil, ni siquiera puedo abarcar con la vista ese monstruo que me arrastra en sus aguas”“Las cartas tuyas más bonitas (y eso ya es mucho decir, porque en su conjunto son, casi línea por línea, lo más hermoso que me ha ocurrido en mi vida) son aquellas en las que das la razón a mi «miedo» y al mismo tiempo tratas de explicar que no debo tenerlo. Porque yo también, aunque a veces parezca ser un defensor sobornado de mi «miedo», probablemente, en lo más hondo, le doy la razón, es incluso una parte de mí y quizá sea lo mejor que tengo. Y como es lo mejor, quizás sea lo único que tú amas. Porque, fuera de eso, ¿qué puede haber en mí digno de ser amado? Eso, sin embargo, sí lo es.”El miedo de Kafka es la realidad, los otros, el abandono de la propia existencia, la cual constituye refugio y tortura. Es la pesadilla de confrontar el ideal con lo tangible. “Y sin embargo no es a ti a quien amo, sino que es más, amo mi existencia que me ha sido regalada a través de ti”Perdedor de todas las batallas, pues su naturaleza era la de la redención, su miedo nace de percibirse a sí mismo con el “pequeño y ruin” papel de espectador con que se describe Andrea en Nada, de Carmen Laforet. Ese de los que nacen para mirar la vida y acaso soñarla, pero jamás para vivirla. El de los miserables, las cucarachas que han de vivir escondidas y solo salir a la oscuridad para no ser pisoteadas. Milena, quien tal vez lo llegase a conocer más profundamente que ninguna otra persona, lo describe así:“Yo sé hasta la última fibra qué es su miedo. Existió ya siempre en él, antes de conocerme. He conocido su miedo antes de conocerle a él. Y, entendiéndolo, me he acorazado contra ese miedo. En los cuatro días en los que Frank estuvo conmigo, lo perdió. Nos burlamos de él. Sé con seguridad que ningún sanatorio conseguirá curarle. Nunca recobrará la salud, Max, mientras siga teniendo ese miedo. Y ningún fortalecimiento psíquico puede hacerle superar ese miedo, porque el miedo impide el fortalecimiento. Ese miedo se refiere no sólo a mí sino a todo lo que vive sin pudor, también, por ejemplo, a la carne. La carne está demasiado al descubierto, no soporta verla. Así pues, eso es lo que entonces conseguí eliminar. Cuando sentía ese miedo, me miraba a los ojos, esperábamos un poco, como si no consiguiéramos respirar o como si nos dolieran los pies, y al cabo de un rato había pasado. No había que hacer el menor esfuerzo, todo era sencillo y claro[…]O en sus propias palabras:“Por mis propios medios no puedo seguir el camino que quiero seguir, es más: ni siquiera puedo querer seguirlo, sólo puedo quedarme quieto, no puedo querer otra cosa y tampoco quiero otra cosa.”En Le feu follet, Leroy renuncia al recuerdo de un paraíso que únicamente ha existido en su imaginación, y aun así le hiere de forma insoportable. Si Kafka renunció al amor de Milena, la mujer a la que más quiso, y la única capaz de comprenderle en plenitud, fue por nunca lograr ser, por poder tan solo imaginarse. Al menos tus sueños viven en tinta y nunca los olvidaremos, Franz.

Από την άλλη, όλα δύσκολα μου φαίνονται αυτές τις ημέρες. Μου πήρε καιρό να το τελειώσω, το χαζοδιαβάζω έναν χρόνο τώρα. Δεν μου είναι σαφές εάν έχει γίνει κάποια παρέμβαση στη μετάφραση του 1986 που κρατάω στα χέρια μου, εικάζω πως όχι.Από τη μια είναι ένα έξοχο παράδειγμα, στο βλακώδες πράγμα που συχνά λέω, πως εάν σε ερωτευτεί ένας κλέφτης, θα κλέψει για ‘σενα και εάν σε ερωτευτεί ένας ποιητής θα γίνεις ποίημα – θέλοντας να αποδείξω πως η αγάπη είναι σπουδαία, αλλά περισσότερο έρχεται να αναδείξει μια δύναμη που ήδη υπάρχει εντός κάποιου – έτσι κι εδώ.Όταν επιμένουμε να λέμε κάτι Καφκικό, από τη δυσλειτουργία εντός air fryer μέχρι τα διαδικαστικά στην εφορία, συχνά εννοούμε και τα παράλογα κλειστοφοβικά όνειρα – εφιάλτες – στα οποία είμαστε το απεχθές σκαθάρι, απομονωμένο, ανάποδο, να πασχίζει να βρει τη θέση του ενώ κουνιαρίζεται στην πλάτη του ενώ βλέπει τις ποδηλατικές ασκήσεις των ποδιών του να σκίζουν τον αέρα.Τα γράμματα είναι γεμάτα από τα απαίσια όνειρα που συχνά τροφοδοτούσαν τα κείμενά του. Φοβισμένα, μοναχικά, σε σημεία φουσκωμένα από ανομολόγητες ελπίδες αγάπης. Καρέκλες κήπου, ποτήρια με γάλα, επιθετική φύση που σκαρφαλώνει μέχρι το μπαλκόνι – μπαλκόνι ποιανού; Παραδοχές απουσίες, εξίσου θανατηφόρες με την πιθανότητα συντροφιάς – αποκλεισμένος στο βάρβαρο μεταίχμιο της μεταξύ τους μετάφρασης.«Ούτε είναι ακριβώς αγάπη άμα λέω πως μου είσαι ακριβαγάπητη. Αγάπη είναι ότι είσαι το μαχαίρι που στρίβω μέσα μου.»
4065815788	Söylenecek çok şey var, ama benim için en önemlisi şu: bu kitaba dair sağda solda “büyük bir aşk kitabı” denmesine itiraz ediyorum. Aşk meselesi benim için ikincil hatta üçüncül, dördüncül planda oldu diyebilirim. Bu kitapta aşk var mı, var; Milena’nın Kafka’ya duyduğunun aşkın bir çeşidi olduğunu seziyorum, Kafka’nın Milena’ya duyduğu aşk mıdır peki? Ondan emin olamadım. Ama sonuçta bence bu önemsiz: aşk, bu iki insanın kendileriyle ve dünyayla kurdukları ilişkiyi zenginleştirmek, didiklemek, kurcalamak, çözümlemek (ve bazen de karmaşıklaştırmak) için araçsallaştırdığı bir şey gibi geldi bana. Ve aklıma Attila İlhan’ın şu çok sevdiğim satırları geldi: “Hayatta kimse kimseyi anlayamaz, kimse kimsenin yerini tutamaz; aşk dediğimiz, ya vahim bir yanlış anlaşılmadır, ya kötü bir hayal kurma tarzı: iki kişinin ikisi de, öbürünün yerine hayal kurmaya kalkıştığından, sukut-u hayaller eksik olmaz! Sen dediğime kulak ver; kendimizden başkasını sevemiyoruz; sevdiğimiz, şahsiyetimizin dışlaştırılmış, bir başkasının üzerinde somutlaştırılmış hayali; o başkası da kendisini üçüncü bir şahıs üzerinde dışlaştırır, somutlaştırır: arada ahenk kurulamaz, nasıl kurulsun, sevdiğimizle sandığımız farklı!” Neyse, sonuçta naçizane tavsiyem, bu kitabı aşk meselesinden çıkarıp okumak gerektiği olacak. O zaman çok fazla, çok fazla şey bulmak mümkün içinde. Korkuya dair, insan olmaya dair, üretmeye dair. Kendimizle kurduğumuz ve kuramadığımız ilişkilere dair. Son not: Milena’nın Max Brod’a yazdığı birkaç mektup bile enfesti. Keşke Kafka’ya yazdıkları da kalsaymış da okuyabilseymişiz, besbelli ki olağanüstü bir kadınmış kendisi.
2990406328	** spoiler alert ** Ikinci Kafka okuyusum...Franz Kafka'nin olene kadar sevdigi Milena'ya yazdigi mektuplari okuyoruz. Korkusunu, düşüncelerini ve hayata insanlara karsi degisik bakis acılarını; yeri geldiginde amacsizligini yeri geldiginde isine saygısını zevkle okuduğumu bundan sonra ne yazacağını merak ederek drvam ettigimi soyleyebilirim. Biraz karmasik gelmedi değil ama roman ilerledikce alisiyorsunuz.Sadece Kafka'nin kendiside itiraf ettigi gibi Milena'yi biraz kucumsemesini, siradan biri gibi gostermesini, sevgileriyle sira disi olduklarını dusundugum icin garip geldi. Sonundaki ekte Milena'nin Max'a Kafka'yi sormak icin yazdigi mektuplar ne kadar ince düşünceli (hastaligin sebebinin kendisi degilde kendisine olan sevgisi ve tabi ki her kadina ) ne kadar iyi bir gozlemci (korkusunun gecemeyecegi ne yapilirsa fayda etmeyecegi) ve ona olan sevgisinin bile bir faydasi olmayacaginin farkinda olmasi cok ilginc. Yine ekteki kendi yazilarini okuyunca incelikli zekasi bence buyuleyici diyebilirim.Romani okuyacaklara onerim ekteki Milena'nin yazilarini Kafka'nin bahsettigi siralarda okunmasini butunsellik açısından tavsiye ederim.
1846120415	Una joya de la literatura. Un viaje hacia la verdad. Kafka se presenta como un hombre torturado, preocupado, enamorado, enfermo y con mucho miedo. Necesita escribir a Milena, a quien ama, a pesar de haberla visto sólo cuatro días seguidos y otro más. Las cartas de Milena Jesenskà a Kafka desaparecieron. Milena estaba casada. Kafka murió a los 39 años debido a su enfermedad pulmonar (tuberculosis) y Milena falleció en un campo de concentración. Es la suya una historia de amor verdadero, que se palpa en cada carta. «Y que sólo sería una enfermedad que pasa pronto y te deja en mejor estado de salud que antes y te permite levantarte con todas tus fuerzas, mientras que yo algún día, pronto y espero que sin ruido ni dolor, desapareceré bajo la tierra. Eso no es lo que me atormenta sino la idea de que te pongas enferma lejos de mí». Sublime, brillante, magnífico. Lo recomiendo totalmente a los amantes de este genio checo y a los que disfruten de la literatura en mayúsculas.
5803930494	I could not finish this. The idea was there, but without Milena’s responses I couldn’t get behind their relationship or understand it as much as I would want to. I feel without her replies the idea of the book is odd. It felt like I was reading a diary when I desperately wanted it to feel like I was truly reading their letters. I also wonder about how they both would feel with Kafka’s insight into their relationship being published like this.

1567755712	** spoiler alert ** Kafka'nın aşkı Milena'ya mektuplarını okurken, 10 kilo patlıcan 5 milyon amcam aşk kokmuyordu. Kafka'nın Milena'ya aşkını nasıl zamana yayarak anlattığını merak ededururken, 10 kilo patlıcan 5 milyon amcamın merak edilecek hiçbir aşkı yoktu. Belki şu vakit uyuyanlar küfrediyordu. Haşaa ben yapmam öyle bir şey, anca Kafka'nın aşkını patlıcan gibi kurutma transına bırakırım kendimi şöyle.Anneden bir ses:-Aşağıya in de patlıcan al, kurutalım.Gidip adama an ve an bana yaptıklarını anlatma fırsatı doğmuştu artık, mutluydum...Ama bir an vazgeçtim.Kafka'ya döndüğümde yüzüne "farkında mısın aldatıldığının" deme isteği uyandı içimde. Milena şu sıralar pek rastladığım kadın profilinin aynıydı gözümde. Evli olmasına rağmen başka bir erkeği kendine hayran bırakmış, bu hayran olma halini de almış sarmış sarmalamış kopartmıyor bedeninden.Kadınların kendilerine aşık olduğunu ya da hoşlandığını anladığı erkekleri ellerinde oynatma oyunları pek bir bilindiktir. İnsan denen varlığın hiçbiri alet edilmemeli bu tür oyunlara. Nasıl bir doyum alırlar bundan anlatamam. Erkek peşinde koştukça, onun için bir şeyler yapmaya çalıştıkça zora koşarlar durumu. Böylesi insan profili bizim ülkemizde lise çağında çokça çizilebilir. Huy edinenlerinki ömür boyu devam eder.Erkek doğası itibariyle duygularını en çok belli eden olmak zorundadır. Bunu bilen kadın kişisi farkında olmasına rağmen zora koşandır. Unutmamak gerekilen şey o dur ki, kadınlar aptal değildir. Aptalmış gibi davranmayı çok ama çok iyi bilir.Milena'ya dönecek olursak, evlidir. Ama ısrarla Kafka'nın hakimi olma yolunda gidip gelir. Henüz kitap bitmedi belki ama sonunu tahmin dahi etmek istemiyorum.Kendini paralayan bir erkek.Sırılsıklam aşık bir erkek.Ve ne yardan ne serden vazgeçen bir kadın.Üstelik dönem dönem Kafka'ya aşık olduğunu bile düşündürüyor kadın!Bu aşk mıdır?Hayır?Sık rastlaşmak mümkün:Akla gelenler:Genç Werther'in acıları.Kolera Günlerinde aşk.Jules et Jim.Salomé'dir ki, evet Nietzsche!.....Sadece filmler ve kitaplar değil. Bunu siz de biliyorsunuz...İşin garip yanı böylesi kadınlar kimseye aşık değildirler. Daha evvel Jules et Jim'de yaptığım yorum gibi:Sadece ve sadece kendilerine aşıktırlar. Bırakın böylelerini bir kenara. Kalsınlar yalnız. Süründürün tepkisizliğinizle. Bakın neler oluyor.. Ama tavsiyem odur ki:İzleyin bu manzarayı doyasıya....İzlemeyenleri de biz izleyelim; onlara bu aşkın yazdırdığı romanlarda, filmlerde, şarkılarda...___Bütün bunları 2008'de böyle düşünüyorken bugün söyleyeceğim şey ise şu: Biz ne Milena'nın sesini duyduk, ne de Salome'un.. Erk sistem sadece kendi acılarının tanınmasını ve kadınların hep ikinci planda kalmasını çok çok iyi bildi.
1811641736	Letters - being as personal as they are - provide the greatest insights into the inner workings of Kafka's brilliant mind and the toll that love (among every other emotion) had on on his health, and which eventually led him to dying in a sanatorium in 1924. His letters to Milena were perhaps his highest expression of his love for her, yet still led to torment:'When I write to you there's no question of sleep either before or after; when I don't write to you I sleep at most a very superficial sleep of an hour or two at a time. When I don't write I'm just tired, sad, heavy; when I do write I'm torn to pieces by restlessness and fear'.He still had time for his typically wry, morbid humour:'You know Milena, when you went to him (her husband of the time) you took a large step down from your level, but if you come to me you'll leap into the abyss'.As the letters progress, you can feel Kafka's love for her - and spiritual connection with her- palpably grow. He even shares with her his idea for a prototype of the torture device used in one of his famous shorts In the Penal Colony. I wonder how women would react to that in this day and age!His was a romanticism steeped in pain, a curse that made him feel excessively but also as a result develop into one of the most precise scribes of human emotion that ever picked up a pen. 'I won't say good-bye. It is no good-bye, unless it be that the gravity lying in wait pulls me down completely. But how could it do this so long as you are alive'His suffering was our gain.
2606847617	إن هذا الكتاب أولاً تحتاج لقرائته بعض الموسيقى الهادئة ومصباحٍ ذا إضائة ضعيفة .. تحتاج لأن تستشعر ليس فقط المشاعر الكامنة فى ثنايا كلمات كافكا، لكن أن تستشعر الجو العام، هذه المناطق شديدة البرودة ، مكاتب البريد ، شغف فض الرسائل والرد عليها .. هذا أفضل بكثير من واقعنا السريع المتهالك، لن تضاهى متعة التحدث على الهواتف شيئ بجانب متعة ارسال الرسائل والشوق الحار فى انتظارها .. لكن سيكون بديعاًً هذا الكتاب أكثر لو وُُجد فيه رسائل ميلينا المفقودة، حيث أن هناك رسائل وأطراف حديث مقطوعة لا تفهم عن ماذا يتحدث، فالأحداث فى الكتاب صعبة الفهم لعدم المعرفة الكامنه وراء هذا الكلام، لكن العواطف الشديدة والمولعة التى يكنها كافكا الى ميلينا، والمشاعر الدونية التى يكنّها كافكا لنفسه، هى مشاعر تستشفها بسهولة واضحة..

1913554960	I've always loved Kafka and he's always been my favorite. And after finishing this book, I've grown such empathy toward him. Kafka, who had struggled so much during his life, who was paralyzed by fear, anxiety and guilt, who never understood the world with all the lies and filthy secrets everyone hides that made him so confused and anxious all the time, who always felt inferior to everyone when he was in fact the purest of all, and still, he kept trying to be strong, stayed pure and never intended to hurt a soul. Those were the most amazing, touching and painful letters I have ever read. I had my heartbroken in each and every time he mentioned the word "fear" and I enjoyed reading the whole book till I reached Milena's obituary for him and it brought me to tears cause I understood his fear, shared his anxiety and found a friend and comfort in him that one could never find in a living soul.
1632862243	Segunda correspondencia que leo de Franz Kafka —la primera carta a su padre —. En 1919 Milena Jesenská comienza a leer cuentos de Franz, y en 1920 le escribe al auto para traducir sus obras en checo, y es así como se produce una extensa y apasionada de ir y venir de cartas que solo durará hasta 1923, debido que Kafka se estaba extinguiendo como la flama de una vela, estaba muriéndose de Tuberculosis.Finalmente Franz Kafka muere el 3 de Junio de 1924 a los 40 años, por su parte Milena escribe en Viena una nota fúnebre un diario de Praga donde dice "tímido, retraído, suave y amable, visionario, demasiado sabio para vivir, demasiado débil para luchar, de los que se someten al vencedor y acaban por avergonzarlo".Las cartas de Kafka para Milena están llena de sentimiento arduo de amor, un amor imposible que nunca llegó a ser algo más.Citas: http://hechaensilencio.blogspot.com.a...
1590968799	reading letters is a new experience for me.the book contains only franz's side because Milena requested her letters to be burned,so reading one sided conversations is a bit strange you have to speculate the other half of the conversation.his letters alone are very beautiful.an excellent work of art, they show his emotions and his not so organized pattern of thinking.they are insightful and sometimes funny.the letters from Milena to Max explain a lot about her and about Franz and their tricky relationship.

I've felt like a peeping Tom - reading intimate diaries does not let me feel this bad, but intimate letters - love letters, it is like probing into the author soul without his permission. Yes, of course, there are things to learn about his life, his opinions, but is it worth it? I'm sorry, Kafka, for this indiscretion :(

7556899903	„Jak to pięknie, że otrzymałem Pani list i teraz muszę Jej odpowiedzieć - mimo niewyspanej głowy. Nie wiem, co mógłbym napisać, błądzę tylko pomiędzy wierszami w świetle Pani oczu i w oddechu Pani ust, niczym w atmosferze pięknego, szczęśliwego dnia, który nie przestaje być szczęśliwy i piękny, choć głowa jest chora i zmęczona i choć w poniedziałek odjeżdżam przez Monachium”. Na ten niefajny czas mocno polecam wam zanurzenie się w „Listach do Mileny” Franza Kafki. Jego czułość i liryczność, która z nich wypływa pomoże choć na chwilę ukoić nerwy i emocje, które funduje nam obecna sytuacja polityczna i społeczna. Mimo tego, że tło historyczne okresu, w których były pisane tez nie był zbyt kolorowy. To przecież czas powoli wzmacniającego się antysemityzmu i faszyzmu, ale w korespondencji Kafki to tylko przebłyski.Franz z Mileną widzieli się w ciągu swojego życia dwa razy (DWA RAZY), a uczucie między nimi wybuchło. To jaka wrażliwość i wielkie uczucie bije z jego listów, to jak dla całkiem postronnej osoby jak dzisiejsze ich czytelniczki/czytelnicy potrafią być ukojeniem i ciepełkiem na sercu. Ale to nie tylko miłosne uniesienia, to też wnikliwe spojrzenie w głąb psychiki autora, osobowości pochłoniętej literaturą, postacią zmagającą się z własną tożsamością, zastanawiającą się nad swoją twórczością i jej odbiorem oraz pogrążającą się w swoich lękach i w pełnej bólu choroby płuc. Ach i nie pomińcie fantastycznego wstępu Ryszarda Koziolka i posłowia Grzegorza Jankowicza - to integralna i istotna część tego wydania. „Jak Pani sądzi? Czy mogę jeszcze do niedzieli dostać list?To byłoby rzecz jasna możliwe. Ale ta radość z listów jest bezsensowna. Czy nie wystarcza jeden, czy nie wystarcza, że się wie? Na pewno wystarcza, lecz mimo to opiera się człowiek głęboko w fotelu i pije te listy, i wie tylko, że nie chce mu się przestać pić”.
4335209868	It's hard to imagine Franz Kafka in love. Yet his Letters to Milena show a fearful yet brilliant man trying to understand his emotions after falling for a much younger married woman named Milena Jesenská. This Milena was no slouch herself when it came to literature. The appendix to this edition includes several letters from Milena to Kafka's friend Max Brod, several essays that she published in journals, and a sensitive obituary when Kafka died of runaway consumption in 1924. Milena was to live for 20 years longer, only to die in Ravensbruck concentration camp where she was imprisoned for political reasons (she was not Jewish).None of the letters from Milena to Kafka have survived, only because after his death she wanted all of them to be destroyed (she was, after all, married). No matter. Kafka's own letters show him to be eager to press on with his suit, yet frightened at what it was doing to him. I have always wanted to read these letters and am delighted to have finally gotten to them. They give a picture of a tortured individual. Milena was uniquely able to respect him for his own brilliance, as she translated many of his short stories into Czech. And her letters to Max Brod show that she, on her side, was almost as tortured as Kafka was.
