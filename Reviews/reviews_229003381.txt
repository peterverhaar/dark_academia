7329054413	“You make me finally understand what people mean when they say life isn’t long enough.”No words just Alex Corbeau Green. Aka my new husband. Aka the most pathetic, sad boy, obsessed, tortured yearner on the planet. I am so done. I have a problem. I can’t remember the last time a fictional man had me this down bad. I actually can’t handle it. This book was EVERYTHINGGGGGGG THEY ARE EVERYTHING!!! I need book two more than I need air to breathe the ending actually made me cry WHAT?! The banter, the spooky gothic university setting, the murder mystery/stalker plot, the suspense, the romance, the pain, the mental health rep, Ophelia made me feel so seen and heard. They literally flirt via email and through crosswords. Bye. This man tattooed, glasses wearing, intellectual, witty, flirty, man who draws her and washes his hair and is like a father to his 6 sisters?! No his backstory is actually making my chest ache. PROTECT HIM AT ALL COSTS I well as they drag me away to the padded room.I cannot. “I’ve built my walls too high.” “They’re worth the climb.” “They aren’t.” We stop on the mansion steps, his tone soft. “They are. For me, they are.”“If you end up being the death of me, Winters, I couldn’t ask for a better end.”“Then I’ll love you with the same intensity that you hate me. I’ll hold on to you just as hard as you push me away. I’ll fix you like you’re fixing me. I’ll always be here, Ophelia, I’ll sit at the bottom of valleys and stand on the top of mountains with you.”“Forget dying for her. I’d live for her. I feel like I could overcome all the darkness inside if only it meant I’d get a life in her company in return.”“Ophelia is my deadly nightshade. She’s bad for me. I know what she’ll do to me, but she’s too beautiful. Too enticing. She’s too deep in my bloodstream already, painful and ecstatic all at once.”“Ophelia feels like finding another human after months in the desert. A light permeating the thick black cloud. When my wayward mind wanders, it staggers back home to her.”
7787140783	As much as I had fun with it, it was far from perfect imo. I definitely see the appeal but it's probably one of those cases where my high expectations let me down. With the way everyone hyped it up, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. The dark academia vibes were really good and immersive. The writing was okayish I suppose. I loved the way it started but it lost its rhythm in the middle. There was always something missing, not sure what but it just didn't feel like it was clicking. Parts of it felt a bit juvenile in the way it was written. The characters were alright. Imo Alex carried the book, he really is a charming guy. I loved his sarcastic quips and wit. But also how appreciated how upfront he can be. He is the kind of mmc who immediately captures your attention. Ophelia on the other hand was a mess. She was fierce one moment, then completely weak the next moment. I just think there was more potential to her than what we saw. The chemistry between the two though is pretty good. I enjoyed the romance and slow build. The push and pull on Ophelia's end got me annoyed at one point though. The banter between her and Alex was chef's kiss. The spice could have been a bit more steamy imo but I guess the author was going for a tasteful approach, which is probably just me nitpicking atp. Sorry 🫣 At least I'm self aware 😭. The ending was really fun to get into. I won't deny that. The way it ended had me shook and baffled at the audacity to not immediately give us the next book 👁👄👁 But I'm looking forward to reading the next one and hope that it's a bit mature in it's writing. Thanks to sweet Meg for reading it with me. BR are always fun with you 🥰 ~•~•~All I know about this one is that everyone is swooning over Alex and I intend to find out WHYYY 🤭
7798220630	I had so much fun with this!!! Alex was a PERFECT MMC. One of the more memorable ones, that’s for sure! Such a good gothic romance. And that cliffhanger!!! Need book 2 NOW!!!
7275107257	Alex could slap me in the face with his rugby thighs and I’d say thank you xxReading this was the best time I’ve had in a long fking while. The meet cute had me giggling biting the tip of my finger kicking my feet twirling my hair. I’ve not felt this way about a couple since so long 😭 I missed this feeling. They’re so swoon worthy. Their banter was ACTUALLY funny. Brit’s always write the best banter I swear. Like I was cackling out loud slapping my knee covering my face with the paperback so fucking giddy after their every interaction. And the tension, quips and jabs didn’t stop even after they got together but it got even better. Can you even ask for anything more really? (More Alex povs — if want to be really picky 😝💋) What am I GNA do now it’s over 😭😭 the wait for the next book is aboutta be so painful 🤚 I’m feeling it alreadyAlex Alex alexxxxxx the man of my dreams TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF who said that! Pls the way he’s actually the most loveable fucker ever??? The respect and admiration he holds for Ophelia has my heart sinking and soaring at the same time. (Ik that won’t make sense if you’ve not read the book but trust me after you read it, you’ll be nodding ur head in agreement) And it’s not just for Ophelia but his sisters and mother ugh he makes me wanna pinch his cheeks give him the cuddliest bear hug and then rail him till kingdom come. Like it can’t get any better than Alex I’m telling u. Ophelia my beloved. She’s the sweetest crossword loving hermit. The way she has the most gentle soul it makes me wanna cry. I haven’t taken to an fmc in this way before and it was a new experience for me. I litch just wanna reach into the book and STAB everyone who wishes her harm (with a fork… laced with acid) The stalker storyline was so yummy I was buzzing with every page. Even tho I did guess the stalker I was STILL reeling after that ending because wdymmmmm this is how ur ending it!!! Miss author did us so dirty 😔 on a serious note THIS is how you end the first book of a duet. The right amount of intrigue and mystery with a nice hint of pain to give that kick (right at the back of the knees to rlly be specific)As the judges from The Great British Bake-off would say, this was an unctuous eat 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:I have theories.

7670769299	✩ 5 stars ✩ What to Expect:➼ Hate to Love➼ Forced Proximity➼ Grumpy x Grumpy➼ Murder Mystery➼ Slow Burn➼ He Falls First ➼ Romantic Suspense ➼ Cliffhanger➼ Dark Academia/University Setting➼ Duet Narration➼ Dual First Person POVThat ending!! 💔 I need book 2 immediately! Over 12,000 majority positive ratings before it was even traditionally published? When a book has this much hype, nine times out of ten I’m left disappointed, but I ate this one up! The overall tone of the book felt very romantic to me. The academic setting, the rainy weather, the star crossed feel of their relationship, etc. I kind of think of romance books like a recipe, a little of this trope, sprinkle in this genre or that, add in a little atmosphere, etc., and all I can say is that this author got the recipe exactly right. 🙌🏻 Hate to love is always a good place to start, but the reason for that hate needs to be justified but still forgivable for it to work and Autumn wrote those details perfectly. The book has a bit of a Mafia undertone that the MMC is distant from but still connected to. I loved that this was included but that the author still managed to write him as a very good and caring man with his own complex motivations for staying connected to the family business. The FMC has her own secrets and reasons to keep the MMC at arm’s length that added to the romantic suspense between them, and the tension was so good! She fought her growing feelings for him, but the plot continually threw them together in ways that were unavoidable and made the forced proximity make sense. The MMC was also just so gone for her in the best way. The more I think about it, He Falls First really might be the best trope out there and the author incorporated it so well here! His grumpy personality made his fixation with her that much sweeter, especially once we get to see his softer side when he goes above and beyond to care for her and his family. He’s actually perfect. 🥰As far as the setting goes, I think anyone who’s been to college romanticizes an academic setting. Heck, just watching Gilmore Girls might be enough to romanticize it. That feeling of walking across the quad on an autumn day is already such a tangible feeling, but bringing that feeling to a Scottish Castle?! 👨🏻‍🍳💋 The atmosphere in this one can’t be beat! I think this would make an excellent screen adaptation! I really hope we get one someday!! I genuinely won’t be happy until book two is in my hands! I need an HEA for Alex & Ophelia! ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼Pre-read: I was trying to hold off on this one since I have so many other books in my Libby account with a clock on them right now, but this is all I can think about, so here goes! ✨✨I found a UK friend to send me the sprayed edge copy from TheWorks! 🥹 So excited for this to arrive!≪ ◦ ❖ ◦ ≫Connect with me on Instagram ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼ ҉ ✼This looks like a promising new release!

7446577233	I fear I ate this up 💅 🚨WARNING🚨 There’s a high chance you might find this predictable and cliché. Honestly, for most of it, I did too! And yet, somehow, Woods managed to keep me hooked. I couldn’t put this down. I think it’s one of those guilty pleasure reads where you know exactly where it’s going, but you’re still having the best time along the way. That said, there were definitely a few twists I didn’t see coming, and I really enjoyed myself!“Oh… am I actually enjoying this?” That was my exact thought as I got deeper into the book. It starts off very been-there-done-that. Ophelia is the mysterious, gloomy girl, and of course, she meets Alex, the hot, rich, too-cool-for-you guy. Oh, and of course the elite school filled with insanely wealthy kids and their over-the-top connections. Yeah, yeah, I thought I knew where this was going. But then, a certain part of the plot grabbed my attention. Suddenly, there was mystery. And wait… was that angst I was feeling?! Oh, okay, well, now I have to know what happens. Some things did end up feeling a little too convenient, but I’m so glad I stuck with it because things got crazy by the end with some of those reveals.I genuinely enjoyed all the characters. They were exactly the type you’d expect in a book like this, but that didn’t make them any less fun. Of course, I loved my main characters, and the more I got to know them, the more I liked them. They’re complicated in their own beautifully messy ways, thrown into situations they never saw coming. The romance? Yeah, I was into it. But I’ll admit I might have enjoyed their chemistry before they got together just a little more… but only because I’m a tiny bit toxic. Just a smidge.The pacing was great, and the book even left me with a pretty cool cliffhanger—the kind that has me itching for the next one!

7784233527	4.75 stars!!!!! ALEX CORBEAU GREEN!!!!! THE MAN YOU ARE!!!I fear many book reviews start off this way, but I want to hammer home just truly how immaculate this man is. carved by the gods themselves. if i made a man perfectly in laboratory conditions, it would be him. f**k. not only was he perfect, this plot and setting kept me flipping pages with a ferocity that 100% messed up my sleep schedule for the rest of the week. I could NOT put this down. yearning???? check. from the second he sees her, actually. banter???? DUH. the protective tenderness of their relationship and the whole “who did this to you” is just the cherry on top ;)) and the mental health struggles they both experienced were represented incredibly well IMO. I am well & truly obsessed. gnawing at my enclosure’s iron bars for the second one now… fml
7728450416	➸ 5 stars “Until midnight.”“Until midnight, a hundreds years from now.” tropes / what to expect: - hate to love - rugby player x swimmer - lonely girl x broken boy - grumpy x grumpy - murder, mystery, and revenge - university setting in scotlandthis book took me by surprise. i knew this would be something i would like but i never expected it to touch my heart so deeply. i completely fell in love from the first page; starting off strong with the addicting banter, i was grinning from ear to ear and excited for the journey and oh the journey was oh so great. i love these characters so much and feel so deeply for them. i am not exaggerating when i say there’s a hole in my heart that won’t be filled until i get book two in my hands because that ending hurt and i NEED more. i’m so excited for the sequel and my mind will take a pause until then because i cannot let go of these characters.favorite quotes:“You’re too good a woman for a man like him.”“And you’d be better?”“Ophelia, love, I’d be significantly worse. But I can’t watch you with him.”“Then look away.”“Can’t.”“I don’t even bother trying to look away. I drink in every minute detail like I’m dying and she’s the cure.”“You occupy my mind.Those stupid crosswords. You’re those for me. You’re the cage for my thoughts.”“A small smile graces her pinkening lips, and oh my god, it’s a smile that’s going to ruin my life. It’s a smile I’ll replay in my head each night as I lie in that blissful space between awake and asleep.”“Ophelia feels like finding another human after months in the desert. A light penetrating the think black cloud. When my wayward mind wanders, it staggers back home to her.She’s everything I’ve been asking the universe for, and she fucking hates me.”“I’ve built my walls to high.”“They’re worth the climb.”“They aren’t.”“They are. For me, they are.”“You make me finally understand what people mean when they say life isn’t long enough.”“You are my worst enemy.”“Then I’ll love you with the same intensity that you hate me. I’ll hold on to you just as hard as you push me away. I’ll fix you like you’re fixing me. I’ll always be here, Ophelia, I’ll sit at the bottom of valleys and stand on the top of mountains with you. We’re too good not to work.”“I love every piece of you, especially the parts that you’ve convinced yourself aren’t worthy of my love.”“Let’s go home.”“Home?”“Wherever you want, love. It’s home if we’re there.”

7612029700	3.5⭐️ this was SO FUN!! Was it predictable? Yes. Do I care? No. This has a little bit of everything and I can absolutely see why so many people love this! Dark academia ✅ murder mystery ✅ mafia families ✅ forbidden romance ✅ secrets ✅ creepy stalkers ✅ he falls first (and hard) ✅ flirting via crossword?? ✅. A bingeable and entertaining autumn read 🍂
7504233176	I’m actually obsessed with this book?? Like, this was so good!! The vibes were immaculate and the setting gave me the autumn vibes I was craving!! If you’re looking for a dark academia romance for the fall, this one is literally perfect! Ophelia was such a relatable fmc and Alex might be one of my new favorite mmc’s (it’s the dark hair/tattoo combo that I will fall for every single time). That ending was CRIMINAL though and I need the next book right now!!!some fave quotes! <3"I feel so deeply. I always have. Every emotion that runs through me goes through an amplifier on the way in. The tiny inconveniences feel like mountains, the annoyances become insurmountable wrath."“Ophelia feels like finding another human after months in the desert. A light permeating the thick black cloud. When my wayward mind wanders, it staggers back home to her.”"There it is; the disappointment, the expectation that trauma has to turn into an inspirational story. That a life changing injury should end in a Paralympic gold and an awful childhood should fuel your meteoric rise to success. Just surviving is achievement enough."
7085873314	WOW. Just wow. This book exceed all my expectations. It was a complete package one could want in a romantic suspense. The kind of book which bleeds raw emotions, authentic insecurities, suppressed desires and smoking-hot angst, which one can’t help but feel those elements like a gut-punch to their heart, in a deliciously hurtful way ofc. “It’s you who’s the sun, Ophelia. I am the moon. You keep me in this tortuous cycle, lighting me up for the shortest time before you disappear again and make me invisible. Ophelia Winters, one of the most relatable characters i have read in a while.abandonment issues? check. trust issues? check. sad-girl & a loner? check. dresses like a 19th century character?(well i don’t obviously but the 99% homeless-looking side of me was thrilled) check. and beneath this persona a girl who craves academic validation and have a strong intelligent personality? check check check “You think I’m arrogant?”I think he’s one of the most incredible people I’ve ever met. “Yeah.” Alex Corbeau-Green, new book boyfriend unlocked!! Ladies, we love men who yearn.Dry humor? check. Daddy issues? check. Brooding grump yet with a sensitive heart? check. Expert in words of affirmation? check. Act of service? check. Protective & Caring? Check. Can go to any lengths to get the girl he’s pining on? check. Add please when asking for a kiss?(yeah, you read that right) check check check “My shrink says I have to do something for me. Something completely selfish. Something that revolves around what I want. You’re what I want, my ultimate selfish act, my darkest desire. So let me work for you. It’s therapeutic for me.” Character Development? One thing that amazed me the most was how raw and beautiful the transition of emotions was crafted, the author elegantly took her time in building the layers of their characters and progressing their stages of development, and it showed in the pages. The writing was hard to connect in the beginning since it’s my first book by this author but gradually i made peace with it, full-on page scenes of the main characters together definitely helped. “Stop looking at me like that, Alex.”“Like what?”“Like I’m the only woman on the planet.”His eyebrows shoot up in very convincing surprise. “There are other women on this planet?” Email and crossword foreplay? If you know me then you are definitely aware that letter are my kryptonite, here obviously they are in a same dorm so we won’t be getting any letters exchange duh, but but but make them emails and i am sat alreadyp.s. i solved every crossword hehe “One down. Seven letters. First letter O. I’ve had a long day, and I want her for dinner.” Their banters? 10/10 Lemme show you all a few glimpses.“Just out of interest, where would you stab me?”“In the voice box, probably. Seems it’ll be the only way to get you to shut up.”“We can be friends?”“Friends who fuck each other’s brains out?” he offers, like it’s a business negotiation.“Friends who say hi in the hallway.”“Friends who fuck in the hallway?”“You’re… big.” Understatement. “What happened to the best two inches of my life?” He laughs. “Finally replied to those penis extension emails in my spam inbox.” “You like my thighs?”“Nope. You misheard me.”“I’d pay good money to watch you grind on one of them.” The ending? Heartbreaking. Okay i’ve read enough thrillers so i already guessed who the stalker was in the first-half in itself but despite its predictable nature, the last part came out as a genuine surprise to me. I felt the last two chapters were quite rushed when i read but thinking about it now, i understand it was written to make readers confused and all over the place and in way to not give them a moment to think what the fuck did just happened. And it sure did succeed lmao. Tropes:☞ Dark Academia☞ Enemies to Lovers☞ Mystery & Murder☞ Low Spice, High tension☞ Scottish Castle setting☞ Grumpy x Grumpy☞ Rugby Player x Swimmer☞ He falls first☞ Found FamilyIf you like dark gothic academia with Hogwarts houses vibes and love reading about two broken characters falling for each other, this book is a perfect pick for you. I can’t recommend this book enough.SPOILER AHEAD!!impatiently waiting for book 2. I want some more explanation about the hallucinations Ophelia was experiencing and how she got drugged in the first place and better insights on her roommate’s way too convenient murder in the second book. I feel like some events were overlooked or skimmed in this book, hope the next book gives some clearance to those.Big Thanks to Love Note PR and author, Autumn Woods for the ARC.────────────────────────────I GOT THE ARC??? 😭 on my way to read this leaving every thing in my life rn👩‍🦯

Yes, parts felt a bit more YA than what I was expecting (although that could just be me). But I still ATE IT UP! 🙌🏻I'd be lying if I said that I didn't occasionally find myself frustrated with Ophelia and her self-destructive tendencies.

7337366098	this had the potential to be so so so good but it just kept falling flat. every time I got invested and immersed in the overall mystery of the crash and the stalker I was jolted out of it by Ophelia’s self loathing and indecision over whether or not she wants to bone Alex then it felt like I blinked and it went from them disliking each other to pining to obsessed?? where was the development other than it just happening.also this was marketed as dark romance and mafia but it felt like mafia was just shoved in there to check off the trope. and these characters were far too childish for university let alone me to take it being “dark” seriously. and just because there are dark themes like murder does! not! make! it! dark! romance! Alex was a cinnamon roll like?? hello I will give it points for the end though because if most of the book had been that exciting I wouldn’t have almost dnf’d six times
7266011229	This book deserves more than 5 stars!!😭I feel like I need to go outside and touch some grass even though it's one in the morning.Ophelia's parents were murdered and she wants revenge. Just her luck she gets invited to the same university as the murderer's son Alex.From the moment they met fireworks but she can't like the guy so it's just burning tension.Alex is a rugby player who has severe depression because of having to take care of six sisters and a sick mom. In comes Ophelia and she's like light at the end of a dark tunnel 😭😭 This man knows how to yearn!!! We all love men who yearn!!"Then I’ll love you with the same intensity that you hate me. I’ll hold on to you just as hard as you push me away. I’ll fix you like you’re fixing me. I’ll always be here, Ophelia, I’ll sit at the bottom of valleys and stand on the top of mountains with you. We’re too good not to work.”The ending of this book makes me want to break into Autumn's house and read the draft😮‍💨

He’s pathetically down bad for his girl, a caretaker for his mom, and basically a father figure to his little sisters *dramatic hand clutching heart*. I needed a man like Alex, because the way he handles Ophelia’s insecurities has me screaming, crying, throwing up—WHY ISN’T THIS MAN REAL?!—I relate to Ophelia so much, and I’ve always carried this heavy insecurity that I’m too difficult to love, that no man could ever actually handle me and my flaws. But Alex freaking Corebu has set the bar and proved to me that my expectations aren’t too high—and that I should never settle for the bare minimum.𓍯𓂃"𝘐 𝘤𝘢𝘯’𝘵 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘺 𝘢𝘸𝘢𝘺 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘺𝘰𝘶, 𝘖𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘢.

7821281281	“He didn’t deserve that.” My shoulders tense. “The date?”“That dress.”ALEX CORBEAU THE MAN THAT YOU ARE 🤏 🤏And then there’s him calling her fish food. At first I was like, excuse me?? The audacity. But the worst part is…it kinda grew on me. Like why am I smiling at this??This book had me hooked from the start dark academia vibes, mafia ties, and a slow burn that actually burned. The tension, the mystery, the stalker element it all blended together so well. My only reason for knocking off a star is because I feel like they dropped the enemies to lovers act a little too quickly toward the end.But that cliffhanger? I’m unwell. I’m nauseous. I’m pacing the floor like a Victorian widow. The way this ended has me staring at the wall, questioning my life choices. Autumn Woods, why would you do this to me?? I need book two in my hands immediately before I combust.Buddy read with my bestie boo Elita +*. -

No way—give me the second book right now! 😭I ATE this book up. I couldn’t stop reading except when I absolutely had to… and even then, during those hours away, I kept thinking: What’s going to happen next? 🤔 I didn’t expect to enjoy it this much, but I seriously didn’t feel a single moment of boredom. I loved Ophelia—her constant battle between her heart 🫀 and her mind 🧠 felt so real. The way she kept saying she hated Alex but loved him… but hated him more. I really felt like he was her enemy, but I didn’t want that at all. How could she hate him without even knowing his side? But revenge really does make you blind. And then her realizing that Alex isn’t like his father at all—despite the coldness, despite those sharp, almost dangerous eyes she thought she saw… there’s this soft, caring side of him 🥰 that only shows around his sisters. And honestly, that surprised me too. Knowing he loves her and won’t leave her, even when she tries to push him away… ugh, that hit hard. Giving him a chance felt so rewarding. But still—why did she have to drop her revenge just because Alex is “her future”?Alex is just 23 years old. Why does he need to carry all that weight alone? I was honestly mad at his mother. He had to take care of seven girls because his father is neglectful and cruel. Then he still had to look after Ophelia, even when she kept pushing him away. His emotional attachment and compulsive need to care for others… of course he fell for the girl who was alone and crying and needed support. But I loved them together 💕. And the way he saved her… AND the way she heard him begging for her. When he said he loves Ophelia but his priority will always be his sisters, I really liked that—it felt real and not overdone ❤️Vincenzo… I do love him, and I enjoyed every moment he appeared, but I’m still suspicious 🤨. I don’t want to praise him too much until I know for sure. What do YOU think? And who do you think the person was in the end? As for the story itself, I loved the mystery, tension, and plot twists. I kept trying to figure out who the stalker was, and even though I suspected it early, the plotline was still so fun to follow.But that cliffhanger—OH MY GOD 😱. I was not expecting that twist at all. I thought that whole situation was already over… but nope. And now I have to WAIT ⏳. I genuinely need 2026 to hurry up.Overall: a gripping, addictive read with a killer twist and a devastating cliffhanger. Can’t wait for book two 😭🤍╰┈➤ˎˊ˗ 𝐏𝐫𝐞-𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝.Seeing this book everywhere makes me really want to read it! Hope it delivers. 🤍
7919332861	⋆˚࿔ Review 𝜗𝜚˚⋆5⭐️THIS BOOK??? I HAVE NO WORDS 😭😭😭I was OBSESSED from start to finish. I don’t know what kind of magic this author sprinkled in here, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I was literally counting down the hours at work just so I could get home and keep reading 😩.The romance pacing?? PERFECTION. Let’s be real, it wasn’t enemies to lovers because Alex was never her enemy—he was a SIMP from page one 🤭. Ophelia on the other hand… she could not stand him at first, and watching her slowly give in had me GIGGLING, SMILING, KICKING MY FEET. The denial? The little moments where you could tell she was slipping?? I was feral.ALEX. MY GOD. Sweet, protective, obsessed, FAMILY MAN he’s the blueprint. His sisters? The CUTEST dynamic ever, had me cheesing so hard. I don’t even want to think about what the next book might do to his character because right now he is PERFECT.Ophelia my poor girl 😭. Why are all dark academia heroines named Ophelia, is there a contract I missed? Still, I loved her. A little dim at times but honestly after the torment she went through, I don’t blame her. Stronger than me, because I would have been OUT of that place immediately 💀. She deserved a single break, just ONE. Protect her at all costs.And VIN. Sweetest little thing, his friendship with Ophelia melted me into a puddle. He deserves the world.The PLOT TWIST?? Had me LOOKING CRAZY. But for once, I was RIGHT about something so let me have my little victory 🤭. And that ENDING?? RUDE. Absolutely disrespectful. I need the next book RIGHT NOW.This book gave me EVERYTHING: tension, banter, obsession, pain, sweetness, and twists that had me clutching my chest like a Victorian widow. It was unhinged in the best way possible.I will not be accepting criticism on my babies. They are mine. This series has me by the throat and I’m not even mad about it.Also, I had so much more fun reading with Uswah . I loved giggling and figuring out the plot twist together—ilysmmm gorgeous! 💕💌Felt a breeze so it’s time 🤭Soo excited to read this with my gorgeous Uswah 🌺😽
7313956514	This was a fun book to read! Despite the fact that it could use some polishing, it went down like ice tea on a too hot summer day.I can see this book being rated very differently according to levels of enjoyment and disbelief suspension, so I'll try to add a few comments that are more neutral/objective, despite the fact that it worked for me overall. 🆗 The beginning was nice enough, but not remarkable. Distinctive marks were scattered here and there quite sparingly. Felt a bit like it was still deciding what kind of story it wanted to be.📈 Even if the content in the first part was a bit here and there, the pacing still worked. I can't say this book ever dragged. The beginning had an average feel, many unsmoothed little edges, but despite that I was hooked, and it kept subtly, constantly increasing my interest in a very clean curve.By 50% it still had some flaws, I still had some doubt on where it wanted to go, but I couldn't put it down.📈 I'd definine this book (not the story, or the FMC, the book itself, if it were a person) "a shy teenage girl becoming more confident in her coming of age, like thawing ice". As you may have seen in my updates, I had nothing that could be quoted effectively up until 27% (it all required quoting longer pieces to make sense), it warmed towards 50% (but was still being a bit awkward —not outright cringy—, at times)... ✅... but after that it really started finding it's voice! The jokes and the lines became original, and effective, showing personality. "I don't know, What do men call their girlfriends? Sugar?" I regret it the second I say it, but Alex raises an eyebrow before I can retract my statement."Sugar. You want to be called sugar.""No, not sugar. Something else, like...""Sugar.""Not sugar. Honey? No. Not honey. Muffin? No."He looks exasperated with me. "Jesus Christ. What's next, Eggs? Preheat oven to two fifty? Baking soda, I'm home!" ✅ I absolutely adored the tiny real bits about Ophelia's insecurities being thrown in. It makes it much more realistic. "I'm a virgin," I blurt out abruptly. Thanks, brain.He nods, swallowing his mouthful with a fond smile, "Cool. I'm not." I nod right back, like one of those dashboard figurines with the wobbly heads. "Cool. Cool, cool. Nice. Good for you, I mean. Get in there man."Get in there? Did I just say that? Oh my god, I reach for the door handle, preferably to toss myself into the nearest ravine, but Alex grabs my hand, chest shaking with laughter. "Thanks, bro.""Shut up." I hope he can't see how red I am. "And I haven't shaved my legs yet.""I should bloody well hope not. You need all the help you can get in that fucking house." He eats the last mouthful of his noodles. "I haven't shaved mine either."My next breath comes out a whimper. "You have really nice legs Really... Big.""Ophelia, I sense you're spiraling." "I'm spiraling." ✅ This thing he says to make her give in to what she wants to do as opposed to what she think she must/must not do has me melting. 🫠🫠🫠 🔖"Can you fix the fact that I don't like you?"He doesn't call me out on my lie, instead tapping my phone screen beside us to see the time. 4:32 p.m. "Like me until five. Then we can go back to before." 🔖"It's almost six o'clock now. Give me until midnight. For my own sanity, let yourself be loved until midnight."There's only so much willpower a woman can have. I surrender myself to his stupid plan. "Midnight.""Midnight, a hundred years from now."I laugh and shove him off me. "That wasn't in the deal""You should always read the fine print, Ophelia." ✅ I loved how Alex struggle with depression was portrayed, this did indeed feel real to me. A subtle invisible monster. The author handled that with grace and subtlety, rather than making it a cheap trope.🆗 Ophelia's mourning and relationships with her parents didn't hit the mark with me so much, but it might be, cause LUCKILY, I can't relate to what she's going through🆗 I'm not into the whole Mafia, billionaires, and gangs thing, always seems so overblown, fake and silly, but it was kept to a minimum. ✅ 💯 The emails with the dictionary/crossword passive-aggressive 'Subject' 🤌🏻[Context: she's hiding under a sofa he's sitting on] From: Alex Corbeau-Green Subject: Claustrophobic (adjective) having an extreme or irrational fear of confined placesDate: Monday 20th October 05:43 BSTTo: Ophelia WintersI'm just dying to know the reason you are lying beneath me right now.I read the email in utter disbelief.

That was cruel.A few years ago I would have not been so terribly disappointed by this, but now it just feels like bad teasing, cause nothing in the book led me to think this would be the case. The teasing was explicit enough in words. So while I'm not one to choose or exclude a book based on spice levels, I think it's very important to mention, as some might very well throw the book against the wall and rate it 1 ⭐ in outrage 😅. [He used her red panties as a pocket square for a very formally public outing 👀👀😂😂😂💀]🔖"Nice pocket square, by the way.""It's very versatile. Wore it as a bracelet in bed last night.

Cute. ⚠️ Cliffhanger-ending warningThe author was nice enough to state this at the beginning of the book, for those who would prefer both books to be out before reading. I thought it was very thoughtful! ✨If this author's writing growth resembles this book, we'd better keep an eye on her, cause she's just only warming up! _________While-readingI've just started this, but for those who read it, which one of these (if any) would you say most closely matches the main characters?[AI Fanart] Option AOption BOption COption DPre-read[Physical copy]I'm switching to this for my physical read since it arrived early, and I am really curious to see if I'll love this as much as I hope I will.I'm currently quite engrossed in Mistborn, so it's going to be a bit of a fistfight between what I want to read the most right now :D
7709953425	Every single one of you who made me read this before a sequel exists is just mean.
7629484983	5 STARS!!Ugh this book was SO good!!!! My first 5 star read in months I have missed this feeling 😭🩷This followed Ophelia, who joins Sorrowsong university to avenge the murder of her parents who died in a helicopter crash. There she meets Alex, whose father is CEO of the company who covered up and ordered the hit on her family. The SETTING!!!! Gothic, dark, spooky halls of Sorrowsong set in the Scottish highlands was the perfect backdrop for this story. The romance between Ophelia & Alex was written to absolute perfection it’s a true slow burn, with such good banter, tension, angst & yearning, I literally couldn’t put this down, this is what I want from romances when I read! Alex is THE MOST INCREDIBLE mmc 😭😭🩷🩷 I love him, I love him, I love him. The way this book ended I need book two immediately, the depth to both characters and the impact that had on where the plot took us was just heart shattering, I need them to be okay 🥺 ‘Until midnight’‘Until midnight in a hundred years’ ❤️‍🩹
7778271665	This book had SO much hype, I couldn’t resist reading it. And, thanks to my book angel 😇 @Amy for sending me a copy 🥰 It is such a treat to read a dark academia book based in Scotland; a place where I spent many summers as a child. The country in itself lends so well to a dark academia vibe, and Autumn Woods harnessed that tone from start to finish. This story contains SO MUCH more than I expected from a 400 pager…haters to lovers, murder mystery, slow burn romance, dark academia, dual POV, and A MAJOR CLIFFHANGER to top it all off! We first meet Ophelia Winters, who has accepted a scholarship at the prestigious Sorrowsong University. She is there for two reasons: ‘I am here for two reasons and two reasons alone: to graduate from the only university on this planet that had a place for me, and to find out why my parents died a mile away from where we are parked.’ - she is certain of who is responsible and is set on proving that her parents' death was the fault of Cain Green, an American aviation tycoon. And, she wants REVENGE! ‘There are two girls living inside me: the one clinging onto her final shred of hope, and the one that wants to burn the world down.’ 😈 She plans to keep her head in the books. After all, loneliness has been Ophelia's only dependable companion for years. The last thing she wants is a run in with anyone likely to get in her way *cough* Alex *cough* 👀 But things do NOT go to plan; anonymous threats and mysterious occurrences start to haunt her…can she survive this alone? At the beginning, I felt like the narrative was a little too heavy on the description side of things (similar to Rebecca), however, I appreciated it later on in the book as it made for a more atmospheric story 🖤 The setting couldn’t have been better - where better to set a dark academia novel than a castle isolated in the Scottish Highlands. The haunting grounds surrounding the castle were the perfect place for plenty to go wrong…or right 😈 “So what does this make us? Study buddies that bury bodies together?” 😵 THIS is the perfect example of a hate-to-love relationship. Mainly because the hate needs a strong justification behind it, and there couldn’t have been a stronger reason for Ophelia. However, there also needs to be an even stronger reason for forgiveness, and these key elements were perfectly written into this story. I didn’t know who to trust at times. I wanted, with all my heart, to trust Alex but was I safe to let myself? 🤷🏻‍♀️ I felt exactly how Ophelia felt: heart and mind - conflicted! I went from an Alex-hater to an Alex-lover alongside her. ‘Forget dying for her. I’d live for her. I feel like I could overcome all the darkness inside if only it meant I’d get a life in her company in return’ 💖Overall, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining read. I kind of wish it was longer but, there is definitely more to come! I loved both of the main characters and their strong family connections; while their families were very different, it was clear they both had a lot of love to give. As I said, the setting couldn’t have been more appropriate for the tone of the novel. And finally, I loved the undercurrent dark mafia vibe that ran throughout. I feel that Autumn Woods has so much more to give, and I can’t wait to see what see comes up with next…4 🌟🌟🌟🌟
7811584906	4,5 ★⋆·˚ ༘ *⁀➷ “I’ve built my walls too high.”“They’re worth the climb.”Romantic, dark and funny is the perfect description for Nightshade by Autumn Woods. It immediately pulled me into the story and I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. Although I rarely read dark romance and I would rather stay away from it altogether, Nightshade was the perfect dip into it. It did not romanticize assault or justify the mmc’s actions just because it's a dark romance. Kind of the bare minimum when you think about it. Autumn Woods also wrote the perfect mix of romance and mystery. It was so enthralling and had me on the edge of my seat in the end. That cliffhanger, excuse me?? I need the second book asap. Alex was everything I wanted in a love interest, he was attentive, supportive and so loving all while he had his own issues. Ophelia was also such a unique main character. She really felt like a real person and was not overly annoying either. I love her so much. I have always adored romances with two people with trauma who find the normalcity with each other. I find it beautiful. Overall, I surprisingly really enjoyed this and I can't wait for book two. Hopefully it dosen't take too long!!
7267162140	Lately, I’ve been seeing this book everywhere, so I decided to read it—and I’m so glad I did because I absolutely loved it!🖤 The FMC’s parents die in a plane crash, and she’s determined to punish the one responsible. She’s fortunate to be invited to study at a university where the son of an aviation tycoon—who she believes is responsible for it—also studies. But as it turns out, Alex is nothing like his father, and she finds herself falling for him despite everything. This is a dark academia romance with an incredible, mystical atmosphere. The characters study in a castle where the lights often go out, and the heroine is stalked. Their text exchanges are amazing—I had butterflies in my stomach every single time! I’ve highlighted so many quotes! I absolutely adore Alex, the way he takes care of his sisters, and when he showed up at Ophelia’s house, I completely melted❤️‍🔥I highly recommend this book, and I can’t wait for the sequel! 𝐓𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐬: ✓ romantic suspense ✓ mystery ✓ dark academia ✓ hate-to-love ✓ slow burn ✓ he falls first

7562844308	3⭐️ ”You occupy my mind.”the banter was good but the transition from enemies to lovers was frail and not convincing enough
7480010001	what to do you mean we don't have a release date set for the second book? i need it by next friday. i also need vincenzo's book. belladonna's book as well. put me out of my misery miss woods 😭😭😭honestly everything about this book is perfect. it delivered everything i expected from it. loved the gothic, dark academia vibes and how it perfectly fit into the fall reading. ophelia's story was heartbreaking, but it was also beautiful how she finally saw the spark and found people that cared about her. she was full of sorrow, grief and the need of revenge, but she was so brave when facing her fears and all the awful things happening to her. not many people would put up with that. even though i wished we had more of alex's povs, i actually liked we only got glimpses of it. it added to his mysterious side. but once he and ophelia got closer, the walls fell down and we were introduced to of the best book boyfriends. his devotion for the people he loves >>>>>>>. i mean there is nothing and i say NOTHING wrong about him. the story was entertaining and mysterious. i love how it unfolded and hate the cliffhanger, but i'm also invested in how it will all end in the next book. i just want my babies to be okay by the second chapter. ────୨ৎ────౨ৎꨄ︎ pre-read: starting this book on my birthday so it better delivers!!!!!!!
7855760655	Oh?! Hahahahahahahaha ALRIGHT OKAY AWESOME SICK TWISTED.
7247976440	i am genuinely mindblown at how phenomenal this is.
7979784906	No because I actually need someone to come and resuscitate me after finishing this book. ALEX CORBEAU GREEN. I don’t remember the last time a fictional man had me this feral?!! 🧎🏻‍♀️I just finished this book and I already miss him. The sad, grumpy, dark haired man with tattoos who only yearns for her will get me every single time. I fear he tops most of my fave mmc’s. He was so witty, flirty and attentive, and he washed her hair!!!… yeah I fear I will never shut up about this man. And Ophelia, I love her. She is me, I am her. She was such a strong relatable character. Ugh my girly deserves a HEA!! The gothic academic vibes, the banter ( the flirting through emails and crosswords OMG) the plot, murder mystery and suspense , this was just utter perfection. Ophelia and Alex together I couldn’t handle it 😭 ( in a good way) just reading about both of there back stories had me in tears. They both need to protected at all cost!! Also the way Alex cared for Ophelia throughout the book and accepted her as she was, no I just can’t. 😭 Idk what I’m going to do until the next book. That ending just destroyed me!! “You make me finally understand what people mean when they say life isn’t long enough.”“We deserve each other.”“Until midnight.”“Until midnight, a 100 years from now.”“But I have a feeling about Ophelia. Like she’s all my future Christmases and everything in between.” “Forget dying for her. I’d live for her. I feel like I could overcome all the darkness inside if it only meant I’d get a life in her company in return.”

I am never one to beg, but I literally BEG AND PRAY for the second book stat. I need it just as much as I need air. I am not even kidding. I say this for every book I’ve loved recently, but in all honesty, this may have just landed in my top three this year, and it can all just be summed up for the sole reason of the whole ambiance and humor of it. #itistoptiertrust 🙏🏼 characters ⋆˙⟡ ⋮ 𝐨𝐩𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐚 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 ── ⟡ ˙🧣 ̟from literally the very first chapter, I already knew she was going to be such a complex character. I haven’t really read a fmc who truly embodies the ‘grump’ trait, but ophelia was it. she was unselfishly herself, and I love and appreciate it so much ❤️‍🩹. she was quick with her comebacks and never let what happened to her parents be the reason to break her. yeah, it may have taken her years to finally get her life together, but that's what makes her real because she showed her vulnerability in the truest way. what she went through definitely shaped her to be the person she was when she landed in sorrowsong, but throughout the book, we can see her develop in the best way, not just mentally, but emotionally, too. she’s a powerhouse on her own, and I just want to give her the biggest hug!! my girl ☹️🤞🏼⋮ 𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐱 𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐞𝐚𝐮-𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 ── ⟡ ˙🏉 ̟his name alone screams rich and in every which way does he give that. he is rich when it comes to his personality and his physique 🤭😆… alex is literally a dream man (my dream man.) in all seriousness though, I love the fact that he is so in tune with his emotions. It makes reading his point of view such a reward; he was truly written from a female gaze. at the beginning, he was supposed to be seen as arrogant, but I was drawn to the opposite of that thought. because throughout the book, you really see how he is and how selfless he is. he would do anything and everything for his family. never putting himself first because if he does, guilt is what he automatically feels. I hope that in the next book, we see him be a little more selfish for himself because he carries the world on his shoulders 😔. fav quotes ⋆˙⟡ ꒰ 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹 𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘣𝘦𝘢𝘶-𝘎𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘯 𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘭, 𝘥𝘦𝘱𝘳𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘥 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘰𝘧 𝘢𝘳𝘵.꒰ 𝘋𝘰𝘯’𝘵.

7310818791	I need a therapist because this book emotionally destroyed me......I was crying for 60% of the plot, and what are you going to do about it?I NEED PART 2 NOWI was so overwhelmed emotionally that I'm in shock.I have so much to say, but at the same time, I just want to be silent because silence speaks volumes.This book is like a person you meet unexpectedly, and then they become so close to you, and you see something familiar, and they came into your life at the right moment.This book broke my dam of positive emotions that held all the pain, and I let everything out, so easily.At the same time, it gave me so much warmth.I saw myself in Ophelia, and I saw it in Alex too.After this book, it's so hard to choose what to read next. The characters are so comforting and cheerful, they feel almost alive.Now, everyone who knows me well will automatically add this book to their TBR just by seeing 5/5.I am so grateful for this book😭I might write more later, but for now, this is it...

7731811708	“Everyone has their string people, the people they are tied to. A comfort blanket. I never even noticed how warm it kept me at night. That I might lose it. Now when I tug at my piece of string, the other end slithers along the ground at my feet. I won’t replace the people on the other end of my string, but I can ruin the people who cut it in half. “ A compelling concept and easily consumable as I was quite glued to my kindle. But the dark broody vibes simply weren’t there. I came for a dark academia adventure and was bombarded with cringe characters with extremely outdated jokes that tried real hard to be hip lol. Also before the acknowledgments, i was fooled by that “ read an exclusive chapter” just to see it was the same damn scene that occurred in the BEGINNING of the book but from the MMCs view, with no difference in the outcome or emotion that changed nothing. Like what was the purpose smh. Talk about a waste of time 😂 Overall, a decent read and definitely not the worst. The ehh, it was alright type of rating

7523366913	this gave wattpad in kind of the best way like was it cringe?? yes. was i absolutely locked in?? also yes.ALSO wtf was that ending??????? need book 2 now actually
7418129312	Gothic Scottish rainy castle that is sad girl spring's wet dream >Tall dark handsome tattooed green eyed love interest >My enjoyment journey of this book: stumbled in the beginning, then ran full sprint, then stumbled and fell at the end.On the outside it checks so many boxes for me, but the execution wasn't a fav. Mainly the characters felt recycled, the dialogue didn't feel authentic to how they would actually speak. Didn't know the FMC Ophelia was Scottish until it was explicitly stated because she didn't read as a Scottish/British character with the diction choices.Spice was fade to black but murder was in full color.
7316750224	4.75🌟Ummm I need book 2 immediately!!!!! Yes, thank yewwwww!!!!! 😭 And how can I summon this man out of this book??? Like HELLO 😭😭 The charm, the wit, the humor!!! Everything about this man 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🧎🏻‍♀️😫 an angel, to say the absolute least. And also um FINNEEEEE AS HELL 😮‍💨THE BANTER BETWEEN THESE TWO????? I was genuinely laughing out loud. Like it was ACTUALLY funny. I was giggling and kicking my FEEEEEET with every fking interaction between them 🤭😭 It was the PERFECT balance of mean & flirty banter, and genuinely only got better and better, too. It wasn’t just between the fmc & mmc either. The banter extended to the side characters as well and it really brought the story to life. I haven’t had this good of a time reading a book in a while. This was exactly what I needed and I feel like I’ve just been revived from my slump. Thank u god 🙏🏻This is why I fking love spooky academia vibes. The murder mystery/stalker plot we had going on kept me locked in with the romance and I just ate up every second.LOVED IT 🤭🤭🤭🤭 GIVE ME BOOK 2 NEEEOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW.

Her constant stubbornness & misery grew old fast and made her character a bit one dimensional.I did enjoyed the building tension between Ophelia & Alex 🖤 They complemented each other perfectly with her pervasive loneliness & his desperate need to care and protect his loved ones. I did feel a bit robed with the fade to black scenes! CLIFFHANGER while expected did make me mad.

7261875434	I'll love you with the same intensity that you hate meI'm extremely grateful to the author and Love Notes PR for sending me the ARC in exchange for my honest opinion. This was such a wonderful read!!If you loved the Amazon series, MaxtonHall and wondered how it'd be if it was darker, had a murder mystery aspect to it, and also in which the FMC wants nothing but to tear down the family of the MMC, you're looking at your next read!! What can you expect ❤️‍🔥Dark academia with a gothic atmosphere❤️‍🔥Elite University in the Scottish Highlands❤️‍🔥Murder mystery❤️‍🔥Eat the rich vibes❤️‍🔥Hate to love❤️‍🔥He falls first❤️‍🔥Rugby player MMC x Swimmer FMCI'm a sucker for books that have gothic vibes, and if that's coupled with a murder mystery and a slowburn romance, what more could I ask for?! Autumn has done a wonderful job portraying the gothic and atmospheric vibes here because you could vividly picture the university and feel the dark unsettling vibes seeping through the pages. Trust me, I had to look behind me countless times to see that no one was hiding in the corners! Alex Green, lives up to his name by being the greenest forest that you could find, and the things that he'd do to ensure the safety of Ophelia had me on my knees!!😭🤌🏻✨He's sassy, charming, and has a sense of humor that us readers would absolutely fall for (not him quoting Dickens every time he wants to annoy Ophelia, and also calling her Twist!!). And I adore how much he cares for his family, and is ready to do anything for them. "let yourself be loved until midnight...a hundred years from now." And the way he makes Ophelia feel loved and worthy is just so sweet of him, despite him being the son of a heinous man, and I always love when the rich guys in books are nothing like their parents!!! Ophelia Winters had been lonely for the past few years, and finds it so hard to trust others & make friends easily. And I really loved that she was able to find her close circle ( foundfamily , my fav trope!!!) in the last place she expected to find one. She was also so relatable in that she found herself gravitating towards crosswords and books over the terrible reality that is her life. Also I felt the panic attack representation to be realistic & accurate too. Someone making you happy is one thing, but seeing the demons in someone's eyes go quiet when they look at you? It's something else entirely. And the banter & slowburn between her & Alex had me giggling and screaming like an idiot, and I adored the way she let her walls crumble in his presence.The side characters were all memorable and wonderful too, and Vincenzo is one of my favs in there. I cannot wait to see more of him, and also our MCs in the sequel. Immediate thoughts after finishing-This was so good and I absolutely love Alex & Ophelia! We had a power outage today, and I binged this in one sitting cuz it was unputdownable. Also I need the sequel like now!!!!

7931613712	Welcome, travellers. I’ll be your guide today as we step through the gates of Sorrowsong University, tucked into the misty highlands of Scotland. The cool evening air drifts around us, carrying the faint smell of rain and something older, something secret. Keep your eyes open—these corridors are full of stories, some whispered, some shouted, and some that will linger with us long after we leave.The castle rises above us from the mountain like a dark promise, its stones heavy and cold, littered with lichens that hint at its age. With shadows pooling in every corner as if the walls themselves are waiting, we walk through the vast hallway, feeling the weight of centuries pressing down. Sometimes Woods lingers a little too long on the darkness, but just when we start to lose patience, a line lands and reminds us why we’re here.Sorrowsong is divided into four houses, each named after a deadly flower: Hemlock, Cortinar, Snakeroot, and Nightshade—the deadliest of them all. Ambition, danger, and secrets cling to its shadowed halls, and we can almost hear echoes of past students daring each other to cross boundaries they shouldn’t. It is here that our story takes root, amid whispered rivalries and hidden alliances, and a sense that the walls themselves might watch our every move.On a pedestal near the entrance sits a leather-bound student handbook, soft with use, edges frayed. We open it, and the pages seem to breathe under our fingers. Ink, dark as spilt wine, lays out the rules:•Enemies entwined, hearts unwilling yet inevitable.•A campus steeped in shadows, ambition, and whispered lore•A brooding heir, carrying burdens heavier than anyone sees, against a heroine whose grief shapes her every move.•Eyes that watch from darkness, a stalker threading through the halls.•Revenge wrapped around a murder, every secret a key to the next.Familiar tropes, yes—but here they feel alive, pulling us deeper into the castle, where nothing is quite as safe as it seems.Down the corridor of the Nightshade Mansion is Ophelia Winters, eyes shadowed by loss but heart burning with vengeance. Her grief isn’t just backstory—it shapes the way she moves, the sharpness in her words, and the careful distance she keeps from everyone, even as the world tries to pull her in.Turn the corner, and there is Alex Corbeau-Green. At first, he’s the enemy, the privileged son of the man she suspects. He should provoke disdain, but he doesn’t. Protective of his sister, quietly weighed down by his own grief, he’s impossible to ignore. And when he meets Ophelia, sparks fly—not because they’re opposites, but because they recognise the same edges in each other.Their closeness grows first in words. Emails sent in the quiet of night, crossword clues shared like tiny secrets. Hostility becomes playful foreplay. Every line makes us lean closer: From: Ophelia WintersSubject: 1 AcrossDate: Monday, 20th October, 05:46 BSTTo: Alex Corbeau-GreenNine letters. First letter U.I’m not wearing any.From: Alex Corbeau-GreenSubject: 2 DownDate: Monday, 20th October, 05:47 BSTTo: Ophelia WintersTwo words. Five and six. First letters H and A.I’m about to have one.The tension coils with every glance, every word left unsaid. Woods nails it—their banter is sharp and teasing but always warm: “Wear your hair down.”“Why?”“The last letter is Z.”Am I in a different universe to everyone else at this school? I never know what is going on. “Huh?”“Sounds like you’re always stuck on the penultimate letter of the alphabet. It’s all you ever say.” He turns back to the bed. “Wear your hair down, Twist, because that’s how I would’ve wanted it.”Then, when the walls crack, patience slips, and confessions spill quietly: “Fine, I want this. I want you. I can’t escape you, Alex. You’re like the sun. I turn away, I look down, but I can still see you reflected in everything at my feet. If I draw the curtains, you slip through the cracks. I can’t fall for the moon instead because it’s you that illuminates it. None of that changes the fact that we just won’t work. You’re not the problem here. It’s me, and things out of my control.”Alex answers, steady and dark: “It’s you who’s the sun, Ophelia. I am the moon. You keep me in this tortuous cycle, lighting me up for the shortest time before you disappear again and make me invisible. Don’t give me that it’s not you, it’s me crap; I hate it.”It’s intimate, grounded, and full of longing—the kind of romance that doesn’t feel forced, even in the shadows.The darkness doesn’t leave. Someone follows Ophelia in the halls, always just beyond candlelight. The suspense chills, and the corridors sometimes feel tighter than they should. The twist—who hides behind the mask—becomes clear early, but that only sharpens the tension, lingering in every corner.Then, just as we think we know the castle, Woods pulls the floor out from under us. The cliffhanger is sharp, frustrating, and brilliant—it leaves us wanting more. The halls here are not gentle, and neither are the hearts that wander them.Now come—the gates are closing. Sorrowsong doesn’t forget its guests.——————————————————— Pre-read: I know better than to start an unfinished series. But, it's all Sara's amazing review's fault( ╥ ᴗ ╥)
7853684149	Um dos melhores livros que li este ano ❤️
7531057164	this is an "academic" romance if you count academia to be vague descriptions of a university in the fall and the mc wearing a bunch of brown clothes and scarves.
7381507203	Wanted to read a romance book and picked one which I thought would have a some kind of plot based on the synopsis, but, every time it came to the mystery/murder/detective work that I’d been waiting for, the writing was either awful or just rushed and so vague.
7553367393	I genuinely don’t even know what the FUCK I just read. Like really. I don’t know what I read. Nothing made any sense. Why are we in a university with mafia members? Who knows! Why do some people get murdered and die at the school, and no one does a thing? Who knows! Why are there fucking Harry Potter houses? WHO THE FUCKS KNOWS BECAUSE NOT A FUKCING THING GETS EXPLAINED!!!!!! Fuck authors who write like this. It PISSEs me OFF!!!
7734698648	1/5 DNF (30 %)Zachęcona recenzjami że to klimatyczna dark academia i od rywali do kochanków, sięgnęłam po Nightshade z ekscytacją.Moje zadowolenie malało z każdym rozdziałem, a na 10 czytnik już latał.Główna bohaterka dostaje się na prestiżowy uniwersytet na szkockim odludziu, gdzie autobus nawet nie dojeżdża, by rozwiązać zagadkę morderstwa jej rodziców którzy zginęli w tajemniczym wypadku helikoptera. Poszlaki wskazują na niejakiego Greena.*deliakatne spoilery*- oczywiście Alex Green podwozi ją na te uczelnie by nie musiała iść piechotą, więc zajebisty research laska zrobiłaś ze nawet nie wiesz jak wygląda syn typa który ukatrupił ci starych.- na miejscu miała zostać przyjęta do domu Hamelock który specjalizuje się w naukach sportowych (nie jest jednak wytłumaczone jak studenci dostają się do danych domów) ale już na wejściu Sofia zostaje skierowana do domu Nightsahde aka grubych ryb szemranych biznesów. Czemu nie wiadomo. Dyrektor / Rada tak chcieli, niby mogła złożyć odwołanie ale tego nie zrobiła, temat zamknięty taka jej doła. Oczywiście w tym domu jest też nasz Alex Green- w czasie drogi do pokoju poznajemy kilku studentów w tym taka parę co z jakiś powodów już grozili bohaterce śmiercią i powiedzieli bez ogródek że są z rosyjskiej mafii (Tu wiedziałam że będzie ciężko)- w zamku są pochodnie które palą się ogniem i jak bohaterka zwraca na to uwagę to słyszy że to przez to że w zamku czasem prąd szwankuje. 5 sekund później okazuje się że zamki w ich pokojach są na karty magnetyczne więc jak prąd siądzie to nie wejdą do pokoju XDD nie wiem jak oni tam funkcjonują bo wszyscy na macach iphonach cały czas śmigają.- Od dark academia wymagam by bohaterowie zgłębiali kwestie nauki, uczyli się pilnie i romantyzowali wiedzę. Meanwhile: nie było żadnej konkretnej lekcji, nikt tam się nie uczy - jest otoczka wspólnych esejów i prac ale tak naprawdę nie wiemy czym oni się zajmują, raczej jest to zabieg by mieć relacje między bohaterami.- Mają barki z alkoholem na każdym kroku i piją wino w BIBLIOTECE. Pewnie autorka myślała o takich pokojach salonowych gdzie książki są i popija się trunki ale tak mnie to wkurzało że oni tam sobie popijawę robia.- Przerysowane enemies to lovers bo trzeba hiperbolizowac fakt ze bohaterka podejrzewa rodzinę Alexa wiec od razu go MUSI NIENAWIDZIEĆ. - po tygodniu bohaterka stwierdza że dobrym pomysłem jest podzielenie się swoimi podejrzeniami obcej studentce, bo potrzebuje jej pomocy by włamać się do systemu i nie ważne że laska jest na medycynie, udaje się jej to cudem XD- dobrze rozumiem że drużyna pływacka pływa w jeziorze przed zamkiem. W PAŹDZIERNIKU.- I teraz tak; dlaczego wszystkie dzieci mafiozów, brokerów z US, shaków z Dubaju są wysyłani do prestiżowej uczelni na jebanym odludziu?? Nie jestem w stanie tego pojąć, bo ta uczelnia nie ma do zaoferowania nic co by miało ją wyróżnić.- no i dziesiąty to rozdział to kwintesencja tej książki:Współlokatorka Sofii zostaje zamordowana. Sofia krzyczy i ucieka na korytarz. Na korytarzu jest Alex. Alex podejrzewa sofie o morderstwo, Sofia podejrzewa Alexa. Nagle typ wymyśla plan i stwarza alibi, rozbiera się, zabiera sofie do swojej sypialni i udają że spędzili razem noc gdy pokoju wchodzi im dyrektor XDDD po tym Sofia ma atak paniki i rzuca się na Alexa będąc pewna że to on zamordował jej współlokatorkę (dowodów brak)Może miałoby to sens ale dosłownie wspominają o tym by sprawdzić kamery na korytarzu XD oczywiście o kamerach zapomnieli wszyscy. No i muszę wspomnieć o stylu autorki. Nie jest źle ale czasem są przeskoki w czasie, nie wiadomo gdzie znajduje się postać no i zdania z dupy, nie wynikają same z siebie.Pająk stworzył pajęczynę na moim suficie.W zeszły weekend przegraliśmy w zawodach.Ojciec mojej współlokatorki przyłożył mi pistolet do głowy (ale że mataforycznie czy nie bo to mafia).Te trzy zdania następowały po sobie w jednym z rozdziałów.
8012509569	3.75 ⭐️ I was having a great time but somehow I was picturing teenagers in my head the entire time and it was throwing me off! Alex was amazing! That’s pretty much all I recall from the book lol - he definitely held this entire thing together! The ending was underwhelming for me since I saw that plot twist/cliffhanger from a mile away… actually saw all the plot twists coming and that was a tad disappointing! Having read Nocticadia recently I can’t help but see a lot of resemblance there 👀👀......Pre-read: the FOMO of seeing this book everywhere has won me over!!
7333820142	pre-read ₊✩‧₊˚౨ৎ˚₊✩‧₊hope i enjoy this book as much as I think i will 🫶fall, here i come! 🍂*ੈ✩‧₊˚⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.25This book is the perfect read if you’re looking to feel all the autumn vibes. The setting is cozy yet eerie in the best way, giving off that crisp, academic, candlelit, slightly spooky fall atmosphere. 🍂 And while the vibes may be chill, Alex definitely isn’t. He’s intense, protective, and honestly a little much sometimes - but more on that later. This story was so captivating it had me reading until 2 a.m. and that never happens, okay? I was hooked.Ophelia and Alex’s love story is adorable. From their scenes in the business psychology room to the little meet-cutes, the perfect banter, the inside jokes, and Alex’s constant protectiveness! I loved it all. 💞 THE EMAILS especially stole my heart (those subject lines!!). And I know I’ve already said this, but the care Alex puts into everything he does for Ophelia? Top tier. 💘 That being said… Alex was definitely a bit too lustful for me at times. Like, sir, calm down. 😅I really appreciated Ophelia’s character development. Watching her slowly open up to the people who care about her - and accept that care - was so rewarding. A lot of that growth is thanks to Alex, and I admire her bravery so much. Honestly, if someone had threatened to kill me, I would’ve dropped out of that university immediately 😂.As Vincenzo and Alex said:“Ten points to Ophelia. You were a wreck the last time someone died.”“Character development,” I nod in agreement.Her humor, even in the darkest moments, made me love her even more. And seeing her slowly warm up to Vincenzo, Colette, Belladonna, and Divya was SO sweet.Also, Alex’s bond with his sister is absolutely adorable, and the fact that the whole family (even the mom) wanted to talk to Ophelia at Christmas? Heart. Melted.Now let’s talk plot: I did not expect the stalker to be that person… what a twist. And the ending?? So action-packed and intense! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time!!I need the second book NOW.
7267708375	Finally! A Dark romance where the darkness comes from the context/circumstances and not the relationship!!!!
7385144004	just realized i was recommended a book with the same title but i read the wrong one which makes sense because this was shit from an ass
8052089993	This was so fun and nothing like I expected it to be! I’m really excited for the next book & hope we see them more as a couple as I felt like it was a little rushed!
7979829139	4 ★ for the enjoyment I definitely understand the Alex hype now and I’m definitely fighting ya all for him 🤺🤺🤺🤺keeping that man and his girl in my pocket for the rest of eternity.Also, can we give it up for the author? You truly did something different in here, can’t wait to see you grow 😮‍💨😮‍💨 Now the book- where do I start? The vibes were amazing, the haunting hallways, the eerie scenery, de darkness of the university and country- it was seriously done perfect. You could also feel the characters their sadness and emptiness so well, I was genuinely feeling their pain. I guess this is also the first book where it makes sense for me a character falls in love faster than normal. I think bc these people are so fcked in the head and sad, when something good comes in your life you just take it with everything and start loving it immediately. The author did a good job making sense of that and I didn’t feel myself get bothered by it like I do with other books. Alex was everything 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 Ophelia ? Love that baby 😭 they are just made for each other. Their funny banter, the way they hold each other- I’m so rooting for them. But back to Alex bc hello??????????????????????????? I’m not okay after reading about him- I don’t even know what to say I think I’m blushing thinking about a fictional character Now let’s become criticalSomething was truly missing in this story for me, but I just can’t pinpoint exactly what it is. Reading this book I had this 3,5 feeling howering over me until that ending, but I can’t really say exactly what I think it is. My guess is that it’s the mystery part. I needed SO MUCH more from the mystery. More finding out, more fake clues, more working together or alone whatever I just needed MORE. For a book that starts strong about unraveling the true, we went off track fast and never got back to it. I kept hoping we would go back to it, but we focused a lot more on the romance and kind of stayed with it, while I would have liked a balance between the two. Because of it, it was unbelievable easy to guess who the stalker was. Besides that, this book also doesn’t feel very “professional” idk how to describe it, but certain scenes were very rushed or not thought out enough making them kinda unrealistic. As much as I liked the ending, it wasn’t very thought out either. Also what’s good to know for some people, this book doesn’t really have smut in it, but also it does? It’s an adult book so even though the author doesn’t write smut, it is a little smutty yk? conversations and all that. It was easy to skip, so no problem in that front but I did think it was annoying how much smutty conversations and thoughts we had after they got together 😭😭 very personal thing I don’t like in my books so if you don’t like that either be aware of it. Okay now to the ending- what the fuck was that ending ??😃😃😃 that’s the WORST kind of ending you can give a book like I taught I knew painful endings but this ending was on another spectrum of pain that it broke the scale. How am I supposed to wait MONTHS for a the next one? I will not breath until I have the next book in my hands, starting now Definitely recommend it🥹🥹🥹Smut:I didn’t count this time besties, just skipped without checking the page for you, pls forgive me😔 just know there is definitely some skipping in the second half of the story, maybe 2/3 official scenes and then tiny paragraphs here and there. —So excited to see why everyone loves this- I’m coming Alex 💃💃—The reviews on this are so funny 😭😭😭 what did Alex do🤭🤭
7580294629	this was so painful to get through. i was so incredibly bored and kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. she goes there to solve her parents murder and gets stalked and it seemed interesting enough but alas. she just goes through the book hating alex (who she had no chemistry with and the relationship felt so forced and shoved at us) that the actual mystery and plot was literally forgotten. i wanted to love this because it sounded so good and has everything i tend to enjoy in novels but it fell so flat. she was almost one dimensional and kinda annoying, the plot didn’t entice me at any point and it felt like this book was only written for the romance in mind, story be damned!
7843315228	nightshade was sooo much better than i thought it would be. the beginning was a bit slow but once it picked up!!!! omg. im so in love with alex×ophelia. the romance, banter, flirting + the setting everything was so good. ♡grumpy×grumpy ♡sad rich boy×sad poor girl♡murder mystery ♡creepy isolated gothic castle♡dark academia setting in scotland♡he falls first ♡healing each other♡banter!!!!! bullying each other = flirting ♡ends on cliffhanger i did predict who ophelia's stalker was but the predictability of this novel didn't take away from my enjoyment at alllll. the cliffhanger was criminal!!!! and i cannot wait for book 2🎧the audiobook is excellent!!! i love duet narration + there was an extra chapter from alex at the end quotes i like:╰┈❥Ophelia feels like finding another human after months in the desert. A light permeating the thick black cloud. When my wayward mind wanders, it staggers back home to her. She’s everything I’ve been asking the universe for, and she fucking hates me.╰┈❥She looks like a Renaissance painting, achingly beautiful.╰┈❥“So what are we now? Study buddies who bury bodies together?” “What? The day I bury a body with you is the day I lose my mind.╰┈❥“Just out of interest, where would you stab me?” [..] “In the voice box, probably. Seems it’ll be the only way to get you to shut up.” His laugh, as warm and thick as honey, dulls the sting of the cold on my skin.╰┈❥“Looks like your bright and cheery disposition has earned you a secret admirer.” [..]“Did you do this or not?” “You’ve not really given me anything to secretly admire.”╰┈❥“He didn’t deserve it.” My shoulders tense. “The date?” “That dress.”╰┈❥Don’t die. Don’t leave me. You occupy my mind. Those stupid crosswords. You’re those for me. You’re the cage for my thoughts.╰┈❥“It’s you who’s the sun, Ophelia. I am the moon. You keep me in this tortuous cycle, lighting me up for the shortest time before you disappear again and make me invisible╰┈❥Forget dying for her. I’d live for her. I feel like I could overcome all the darkness inside if only it meant I’d get a life in her company in return.╰┈❥“Then I’ll love you with the same intensity that you hate me. I’ll hold on to you just as hard as you push me away. I’ll fix you like you’re fixing me. I’ll always be here, Ophelia, I’ll sit at the bottom of valleys and stand on the top of mountains with you. We’re too good not to work.”╰┈❥“It feels like I’ve been alone in my corner for a long time, okay?” [..]“I’ve built my walls too high.” “They’re worth the climb.” “They aren’t.” We stop on the mansion steps, his tone soft. “They are. For me, they are.”
7646219020	4 ★I have a lot of thoughts, so here’s my attempt at putting them into a somewhat coherent review without making it too long😭I will start with the standout element for me which was the two main characters Ophelia and Alex.𐙚Ophelia:She’s probably one of the most relatable FMCs I’ve read and connected with in a long time. As someone who’s experienced grief and loneliness, I thought the author portrayed those emotions really well through her character. ❝I don’t know myself anymore. I don’t know what I like, I don’t know what makes me happy. I don’t know how to be a girlfriend.❞ 𐙚Alex:A depressed, brooding rugby player. I really felt his pain and his struggle as he tried to look after his sisters and mother. Once again, the author did an amazing job portraying his emotions. Both MC's felt incredibly real. ❝She’s fucking miserable, yet she makes me feel alive.❞ I also want to say I absolutely loved the humor in this book—some parts genuinely had me laughing out loud. I like how the author balanced the light, funny moments with the more serious themes, which made the story feel emotionally engaging.𐙚Romance:Loved it!! This was slow burn hate-to-love with lots of angst. The back and fourth banter was so good and when they got together it was super cute. This man was washing her hair, caring for her—I was swooning😩 The chemistry and connection was amazing. ❝I know you, love. I see you and I know you.❞ ── .TO BE LOVED IS TO BE SEEN.The spice was minimal. I would say 1-1.25🌶️ It was mostly fade to black with a few scenes mentioned but never shown -insert voice-I hope you’re hungry… FOR NOTHING. There’s a lot of buildup and teasing, which led me to expect more explicit scenes😭 So if you’re going into this hoping for a spicy read, you might end up slightly disappointed. That said, the romance made up for it.I want to say the book was not without flaws. The writing was a little disjointed and unclear at times. The actual story itself was unrealistic, so you’ll definitely need to suspend your disbelief. On top of that, the plot was fairly predictable.I would say this was more of a 3.5 ★ read, BUT because I really loved the characters I'm rounding up. Also ends on cliffhanger so be warned!!tropes:🍂dark academia 🍂hate to love 🍂slow burn 🍂he falls first 🍂murder & mystery 🍂set in scottish castle
7866473257	Nightshade was not what I expected it to be, and that’s the best summary of it.Let’s start out with the positive. The exploration of love and hate, and how the two can twist into one another, was written with striking nuance. I understood Ophelia’s fury toward Alex, but I also understood the quiet torment of being drawn to him despite herself.Alex, on the other hand, he is not simply cruel or cold; he is the aftermath of his father’s brutality. His words about living in shades of gray, about existing without feeling, carried a weight that lingered with me long after I left his chapters.Now the issues I have with the book:I can’t help but feel that the revenge plot deserved a sharper edge. Ophelia often seemed adrift, uncertain, stumbling through choices rather than truly pursuing answers. The lack of investigation left some threads hanging, when they could have added so much depth to her journey. Alongside that, I found myself longing for more world-building, greater clarity on the forces at play, and why events unfolded as they did.I did unravel the identity of the stalker earlier than I would have liked, but even so, I find myself hoping that the next book will dive deeper into the reasons behind his actions…. Something beyond the single thread of the affair with her mother we were given here.And then there was that cliffhanger. I understand she wanted to create a suspenseful ending that will make us crave more, but Alex’s sudden abandonment of Ophelia felt jarringly out of character. After everything, after the horror of the kidnapping, for him to vanish without even granting her the chance to explain…. It rang lazy storytelling, and it broke the delicate trust that had been so carefully woven between them.
7574541036	this was so bad i couldn’t stop laughing. i don’t know what those other reviews are talking about
7846104626	ate this up can’t wait until book 2 🍽️
8102695794	Omggg this book got my heart I was crying,giggling and everything else absolutely one of my five best read this year
7176525174	I'd like to sincerely thank Autumn Woods and Love Note's PR for sending me a free copy of this masterpiece in exchange for my honest review!I'll round up my rating to 5 stars and explain why I give it 4.5 stars at the end of my review. Spice : 1/5 but the tension made it woooooorth it !!!✨Tropes : - Dark academia- Mystery- A mysterious stalker- Found family- Enemies-to-lovers- He falls first and harder- Inexperienced FMC- Broken MMC- Grumpy X Grumpy- Slow burnI AM ON MY KNEES. What a great book!! I can’t believe how fast I tore through this. Nightshade absolutely consumed me. The characters are beautifully written—raw, broken, deeply flawed, but still so determined to live and achieve everything they want (or need to). "Even a fabricated moment with the wrong person feels better than loneliness." Ophelia is strong and determined but also vulnerable and a little naive in just the right ways. She's witty, far from a doormat, and super relatable. As for Alex…?? ALEX IS MY EVERYTHING. He’s tall, dark-haired, broody, mysterious, tortured, and utterly broken—but also the sweetest, most obsessed, funniest book boyfriend ever. The tattoos !! I love him 🥺The chemistry between them?? OMG. It’s off the charts, like a whole different level. They fit together so perfectly and the tension between them whenever they’re in the same room is electric. They basically play cat-and-mouse from the start. The enemies-to-lovers trope is done to perfection, and the way they slowly break down each other’s walls is so satisfying. The buildup was so sweet, and when they finally explode, unable to stay away from each other anymore, it feels completely earned (and VERY hot lol). They're also so funny, I love it !! " How was it ?" I give her a shy smile. "It was great. The big ones hurt, so… Alex’s is perfect." Stupid ginger pigeon, It’s the worst way a man has ever described me, and yet I’ve never felt so seen. The plot was solid, the pacing was on point, and even the side characters were well-written, though I didn’t get super attached to them since they didn’t get much focus. It kind of gave me Harry Potter vibes, like if it had been for adults, without magic, but with that dark academia feel and a more mature/adult take on certain themes. The ending though… gut-wrenching. It should be illegal. AUTHOR, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! I HAVE A HEART. I HAVE FEELINGS. That was too much. I’ll need time to recover from it, lol. Reasons for my 4.5 stars instead of 5:1. While the plot was great, and the twists had me hooked, I did find the big plot twist a bit predictable. I wasn’t 100% sure, but I wasn’t shocked either when it was revealed.2. Alex’s reactions/actions at the end—I just feel like if I were writing it, I wouldn’t have had him react that way. Close, but not exactly how I pictured it, and that was a bit disappointing. I would’ve liked something a little different for his character.3. I would’ve loved more of Alex’s POVI'm so so so excited for book 2! I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. He tucks an unruly orange curl behind my ear. “You can take it, baby. I’ll help you.” Fuck. Me. I went along with it as a one-time treat but told him if it happened again he’d lose a ball. 3:00 a.m. is an unsociable hour for me.
7496642498	** spoiler alert ** This was so shit. What a waste of time. 4 years of wanting to get revenge and this bitch abandoned it in 4 months … for a man. Gurl bye. How pathetic. She was literally the worst investigator ever. Omfg she was insufferable. Not once did she really investigate her stalker bro literally just took it like everything was normal. If I had a stalker who ATTEMPTED TO KILL ME, KILLED MY ROOMMATE ANDDDD ENTERED MY ROOM MULTIPLE TIMESSS I WOULD HAVE GONE FULL SHERLOCK TO FIND THIS MF. But no Ophelia didn’t do that. She literally did nothing but say how much she hated Alex the entire book. Alex has too much on his plate to get into a relationship with this bipolar bitch. The plot was so badly paced. Everything felt vague. There was no substance in the stalker plot. The whole reveal was anticlimactic. I literally guessed who it was sooo early on in the book. The romance lacked romance 😭😭 I could literally read anything if the romance is good but this really shocked me. The cliffhanger too 🥱. I don’t care. Literally couldn’t pay me to read the next book.

I saw so many BookTubers praising the ending and claiming to be “gagged,” and honestly, I thought they were exaggerating while I was reading. But the last two chapters proved me painfully wrong. I’d convinced myself nothing else shocking would happen, and then Autumn Woods decided to absolutely obliterate me. I need the second book immediately. Not tomorrow, not in a few months — now!ᝰ.ᐟ➛ 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬┊“𝒀𝒐𝒖 𝒅𝒖𝒈 𝒎𝒆 𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒎𝒚 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒔𝒂𝒗𝒆𝒅 𝒎𝒚 𝒉𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒕 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒇𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝑶𝒑𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒂.” 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐨𝐩𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐚 by 𝐓𝐚𝐲𝐥𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐰𝐢𝐟𝐭 ⋆˚࿔ This story is dark romance but not in the stereotypical, toxic way. It’s dark in its atmosphere, its mystery, and its character depth, but the romance itself is surprisingly gentle and emotionally grounded. It gives the same type of “dark but soft” relationship energy that I love from the Mindf*ck series. So it's actually more a contemporary romance with dark themes instead of dark romance. The dark academia vibe is perfection, the plot is addictive, and the mystery (even though I guessed it early) was still incredibly fun to follow. If you’re someone who doesn’t predict twists easily, you’ll probably end the book staring into the void.Ophelia Winters, our FMC, completely grew on me. At first, I wasn’t deeply connected to her, but as the book progressed, and especially in that vulnerable scene near the end, I found myself feeling everything she felt. Her trauma is handled with sincerity, and her strength is understated but powerful. Ophelia isn’t the type of heroine who postures toughness, she’s the kind who carries real wounds and still chooses to face them. Watching her slowly open up, trust again, and allow herself to be soft was genuinely moving. She deserves so much more than the world has given her, and I loved watching her reclaim even small pieces of herself.Alex, though. He surprised me the most. At first, he comes across as the classic dark, brooding, morally gray academic love interest — the type you think you’ve seen a dozen times. But once the layers start peeling back, he becomes something entirely different. Caring. Gentle. Thoughtful. He carries the weight of a mentally ill mother he loves so much and six younger sisters he practically raises himself, and yet, despite everything on his shoulders, he consistently shows up for Ophelia. From the beginning, even when they "hate" each other, his loyalty and protectiveness seep through in subtle ways. What made me love him the most is how patient he is. He never pressures Ophelia, never demands explanations, never punishes her silence. He gives her time and emotional safety, which is something so rare in any type of romance books.Their dynamic is healthy in a way you don’t always see in books with such heavy themes. They both keep secrets, but they never weaponize them against each other. Even in conflict, there’s a deep thread of respect that makes their relationship feel grounded, believable, and quietly intimate. It’s not showy, it’s steady and sincere, and that makes it even better.The side characters added so much personality to the story. Alex’s mother absolutely broke my heart. What she faces is both devastating and, sadly, a very real issue in today's world. The way the media and the modeling industry can tear a woman apart after childbirth is horrifying, and watching how that pressure shattered her sense of self was gut-wrenching. His little sisters are sweet and brought light into the darker moments. And then there’s Vincenzo, Belladonna, and Colette. They were characters who were so kind, especially Colette (I loved her) that I was genuinely suspicious of them the entire time. They had me questioning every motive.࣪ ִֶָ☾. ➛ 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐞┊That ending, though. I can’t stop thinking about it. It was bold, brutal, and exactly the kind of twist that elevates a dark academia romance into something unforgettable. Knowing the sequel likely won’t come until early 2026 feels like emotional cruelty, because I need answers immediately.I would recommend Nightshade to absolutely anyone who loves dark academia, mystery-driven plots, and romances that are gentle but emotionally intense. This book will be living in my brain non-stop, and I’m already counting down the days until book two.
