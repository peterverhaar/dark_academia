5962229229	Holy …. my words will never do this story justice.It hadn’t hurt, the day he had cut out his own heart … No one would want a heart like his. But he’d still cut it out and given it away.Sometimes, when I’m writing a review, all I want to do is quote. Because the writing of an author is so stunning and poetic, it hypnotizes me, and I can’t put into words what that book did to me. This is such a book. Everyone saw Andrew as shattered and fragile, and maybe he was to them. But when Thomas looked at Andrew’s sharp edges, he thought them dangerous and beautiful—not weak.Don’t Let the Forest is about an asexual boy …People didn’t just kiss and continue on with their lives. They undid buttons and touched mouths to hot skin and lost themselves within each other.… and his feelings for his best friend, the boy with hair like autumn leaves …Thomas was a wild machete with blazing emotions he’d never learned how to moderate properly … this boy made of angular frowns and thorny words. He was brilliant and terrible and unmanageable.It's about monsters, but in the end, it’s about hurt and our own fears and how we handle them …When something moved in the dark, everyone’s first instinct was to go inside and hide under the covers. As if monsters couldn’t open doors and crawl into bed with you.Let me tell you, I’m not much of a horror fan, but I devour books like these. You know when tension and pain are clawing themselves into your body and trying to tear your heart out? Like an undercurrent so strong it will leave you gasping for breath? A story that digs and digs and, despite all the discomfort and angst, embraces you and warms you on the inside? Don't Let the Forest In is gruesome at times but oh so soft and comforting simultaneously.This was the place where he roared and grew taller, where his smile could make flowers bloom and his energy could flow endless and untamed.For those who love Jeff Zentner's writing and can handle more angst, this one is for you. C.G. Drew’s writing reminded me so much of his’. Both authors juggle with words and put them together in stunning sentences, and I want to read those sentences on and on and on. They were beautiful together; they were magic and monstrous, and they had created a whole vengeful world between them.Please read this book!Thank you so much, Macmillan Children's Publishing Group and NetGalley, for this beautiful ARC.

6293461611	This masterful cover art speaks volumes about the creepy, sensational, ominous, yet uniquely artistic themes of this YA fantasy-horror, queer novel that you absolutely must add to your reading list immediately!I devoured it in one sitting and found myself liking it even more than I expected, despite piecing together the mystery a little earlier thanks to my overworking spidey senses that are always searching for underlying meanings. The concept of monstrous drawings coming to life to hunt down their creator and loved ones is a perfectly creative plotline. The intense chemistry between Andrew and Thomas had me squirming in my seat, screaming at the chapters, “Just kiss him already, damn it!” I'm always a little impatient when I see smoking passion between characters. The gothic school theme, the detailed descriptions of the monsters lurking around the haunted forest, and the dynamics within the school, including popular kids, bullies, queer kids, and wallflowers, were portrayed realistically and made us care and root for Andrew even more. Even though I’m a middle-aged woman, I easily connected with Andrew's characterization, which helped me embrace my own quirky, outsider, sensitive childhood self.Here's a recap of the story: it opens with Andrew Perrault’s return to Wickwood Academy with his polar opposite twin, Dove, who is a high achiever, competitive, and a social butterfly compared to Andrew's anxious, socially unadapted, shy demeanor. Andrew enjoys creating twisted fairytales with non-happy endings, ending in tragedies, and the only one who can see him as he is is Thomas Rye: rebellious, quick-witted, talented artist boy who becomes Andrew's guardian angel after the school bullies target him, becoming the third member of the tight bond he shares with his sister, Dove.Thomas brings Andrew's twisted fairytales to life on paper, creating artistic, powerful, and extra-frightening monster drawings.Andrew is thrilled to reunite with his friend after the tragedy that occurred nearly five months ago, changing their lives. But as soon as he steps foot into the academy, he realizes that nothing is as it used to be. Dove is still angry at Thomas after their fight, and Thomas is acting suspiciously, trying to hide a blood stain on his sleeve. The surprise visit from the police officers to question Thomas only makes things weirder. Gossip starts spreading around the school, with students speculating that Thomas may be the murderer of his abusive parents.Could it be true? Why is Thomas distancing himself and disappearing into the woods every night? Could he have a secret relationship with Dove? Andrew grapples with jealousy over his unrequited feelings for Thomas and fear for him if he's involved in something malicious. What exactly is happening in the woods when darkness falls? Could it be related to the monstrous universe they created together?Overall, this book is eerie, tragic, haunting, but also a heart-wrenching, beautiful love story that I highly recommend you read!Many thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Children’s Publishing Group/Feiwel & Friends for sharing this amazing book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter
6162761932	What. The. Actual. Fuck. Did. I. Just. Read. This book is the closest decent into madness I have ever encountered and I am fucked up about it. (4.5 stars)(The asexual rep in this was neat)(What the actual fuck is wrong with every adult in this book).
6733005043	dnf @ pg 171 plain and simple — i’m boredthis was a wonderful cure for my insomnia but i have far too many books on my tbr to be put to sleep by this story anymore 😴 too much purple prose. i dislike all the main characters. not enough horror. repetitive.
7005190538	4.5 starsThis is such an atmospheric and beautifully written story, even though it's quite dark and gruesome. More than I'm usually comfortable with. I have to say that there were a couple things that I knew or guessed, but that didn't take away from how completely invested I was in the storyline and the characters. The only unfortunate outcome of reading this book is that I don't see myself walking in the forest or eating mushrooms anytime soon. 😅

For me, this is that exact situation. Judging a book by its cover art really can be a double-edged sword... you either miss out on a GREAT book with less impressive artwork or you are completely underwhelmed after falling in love with it. Clearly, I am in the VERY slim minority here when it comes to how I feel about this story. The beginning was hard. Hell, even up until about 50% thru, I was considering DNF'ing.Before I get into my issues and why I rated the way I did, let me praise the two things I think are great about this story. First off, the spectrum of representation in this story is refreshing. The author touches on themes of identity, mental health, and even eating disorder. While these are not easy topics to discuss or convey, they are very important to talk about - especially for the target audience of this story (teenagers). Second, Drews has a gorgeous writing style. Despite my enjoyment of the story being what it was, the prose is beautiful and I'd absolutely be willing to try another book by this author just because of that. Onto the things that I really wasn't feeling:/𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐟 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤. I struggled here so much. This story is labeled as "YA psychological horror" and based on the blurb, I was expecting to be thrown into this insane world of horrors come to life. What I was not expecting was how focused this book was on sexual identity and being okay with one's self the way they are. While that is an EXTREMELY IMPORTANT aspect of a story, especially for a YA book, I wish there would have been more indication that desire and romance was a major part of the plot. While that's not a bad thing, I wish I had known that that's how the story was going to move forward. The only thing that kept me going was the author throwing a bone here and there with something creepy to make me think that something was actually going to happen (spoiler, nothing really happens until about 75% of the way through).I also found that I was 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐚 𝐟𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐰, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫. I don't know what about him put me off, but something about his attitude throughout the story really kind of threw me. I think it's the angsty teenager vibe that surrounded the story... though I'm not so sure, because I did enjoy Thomas' character for the most part. Lastly, the story as a whole/the ending. Without spoiling anything, I truly had a hard time connecting the pieces. 𝐈 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐚𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞/𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐝. I did enjoy the creepy parts, I just don't quite know... how it fits together? I guess? I can make the basic surface-level connections, but to me, the two stories kind of felt disjointed from one another. Maybe it would be worth rereading just to see if I'm missing something or can see the foreshadowing, but I don't think that I can drag myself through what I struggled through the first time. Overall, I think it definitely fits into the YA category and will do really well there. While I didn't enjoy it as much as I had expected to, I think had I went into it knowing that 'horror' was more of a vessel to move a story along rather than then entirety of the plot I would have liked it the slightest bit more. Thank you to the publisher, CG Drews, and Netgalley for an advanced copy of this book.
6832108116	5 stars! ☆⤿ major spoilers ﹒⟢what the fuck. like genuinely what the fuck. this book completely messed me up. like i finished it and just sat there staring at the wall. i really think this might be one of my favorite reads of the year. i picked it up so randomly—had it sitting on my tbr for months, didn’t reread the blurb, just dove in—and somehow it was exactly what i needed. i didn’t know where it was going, i didn’t know what was real, i didn’t even care. i was fully in it.the writing is so haunting and strange and lyrical. there’s this heaviness to the atmosphere—like you’re reading something poisonous and beautiful at the same time. the way the monsters are described, the little story fragments and illustrations woven in, the forest itself—it’s just creepy and gorgeous and terrifying all at once. and the pacing? the way it slowly descends into horror? i kept forgetting this was horror until something absolutely deranged happened and i had to stop and go “oh my god.”andrew fully broke my heart. he’s anxious and lost and holding himself together with tape and stories. he spends so much of this book not knowing what’s real, not knowing who to trust, and just trying to survive—and not in a horror way, in a mental breakdown way. the reveal that dove was dead for five months and he didn’t know? that he was hallucinating her and everyone else was trying to tiptoe around it? that completely destroyed me. and it made everything earlier in the book so much sadder. like him ripping up that drawing of the three of them and not understanding why thomas looked so devastated? yeah. because she was dead. andrew not knowing what’s real, begging thomas to be real, realizing his stories might be killing people—he spirals so hard and i was right there with him.thomas was a disaster in the best way. he’s reckless and guarded and constantly holding back some horrible truth. and i wanted to shake him half the time but also he’s trying so hard to protect andrew and it made me feel worse. like him pushing andrew away because he thinks the monsters are killing everyone close to him? horrible. and then he comes back anyway. every time. and then we get that scene. “i’ve loved you since we were twelve.” the reveal that the fight with dove was about him. the way he’s angry and devastated and still shows up? love him.their relationship is so messy and painful. andrew would literally die for thomas. has probably tried. he says at one point that he’d kill for him. and thomas just knows that. they keep hurting each other but never actually let go. the tension between them was insane. like the scene where andrew thinks thomas isn’t real and thomas puts his thumb over his pulse and kisses him like it’s the only way to prove he exists? actually unwell. and then the fight about dove. andrew asking if they kissed. thomas not answering. like i was already spiraling and then that scene just made it worse. it’s not even a romance in the traditional sense, but it’s so charged and devastating.dove gutted me. i didn’t even like her at first. she felt cold and distant and mean, and then the reveal hit and suddenly every scene with her broke my heart. andrew was hallucinating his dead sister and had no idea. and everyone else knew. they just didn’t say anything. didn’t bring her up. didn’t correct him. they acted like it was normal because no one knew how to tell him. the scene where thomas says “that thing you were talking to wasn’t her”?? one of the scariest and saddest moments in the whole book. and then the memory coming back. what actually happened in the forest. actually insane. even the side characters felt layered. lana, especially. her anger at thomas was so sharp, and once you realize what she knows and what andrew doesn’t, it hits different. her calling him a murderer. the way she clearly still cared about dove and felt betrayed by all of it. and clemens. actual worst teacher in existence. the way he treated andrew and thomas? insane. and then what happened to him. i was like okay… good. and then immediately spiraled over what it meant for andrew. the book is constantly playing with who you trust, who you’re scared for, who’s in control. it’s exhausting. but in a entertaining way.and the horror. the actual monsters. the antler king. the stories coming to life. andrew being the creator without realizing. thomas trying to take the blame anyway. it’s all so layered and weird and brilliant. the drawings were terrifying. the monsters breaking into the school, the wallpaper scene, the mirror, the vines. i was genuinely creeped out. and i love that there’s still no clear answer by the end. the story never confirms what’s real. thomas might not be real. the monsters might not be real. maybe dove’s still alive. maybe she never was. i still don’t know. and i kinda love that.the ending absolutely wrecked me. everything was so intense and then it just ends. no warning. no closure. i cried. i rarely cry during books. but andrew’s final realization, the note, the memories, the way he doesn’t even know what’s true anymore? it was so much. and then going back through my annotations after? i was screaming. all the moments that seemed off at the time that make so much sense in hindsight? yeah. it’s one of those books that rewards you for rereading. and then ruins you again.this was genuinely incredible. i don’t even know how to explain what it did to me. i love andrew. i love thomas. i’m terrified of the forest. i will be reading whatever this author writes next the second it comes out. i need more people to read this so i can scream about it properly.━━━━ ⊱⋆⊰ ━━━━☆ 🖇️ pre-read 𖥻 ＜꒱last book in my no series streak. after this i’m going back to 600 page fantasies with sequels i’ll never finish.
6760414057	Thanks to NetGalley for the arc. All opinions are my own (clearly). Don’t Let the Forest In follows Andrew Perrault in the aftermath of a mysterious friendship disaster between his twin, Dawn, and his obsessive crush, Thomas. His return to Wickwood Academy is bad enough, dealing with having no friends and continued bullying, when Thomas’s monsterous drawings come to life, threatening him and everyone around him. Together, the two boys try to rub their two braincells together to put an end to the monsters and figure out what they mean to each other, even as the horrific odds turn against them. The result is a poorly anchored book with terribly handled twists and weak characters. The main problem with the book is the lack of on-page set up for characters and their relationships. Much of the premise of the book lies in how different Thomas and Dawn act with Andrew compared to when their friendship at its peak. Unfortunately, their friendship is completely off page, so the whip-lash that Andrew feels has to be tediously explained to us. The reader is meant to understand that these characters have this deeply established connection, without any work being done to make us believe it. This is a huge issue, as this book revolves around Andrew and Thomas’s intensely obsessive and codependent relationship. The problem with the relationships is also tied to Andrew’s weakness as a character. He is completely obtuse about the things going around him and he’s annoying to read about. Things that are obviously worth considering about the horrors haunting him and the people around him fly right over his head every time, making for an incredibly frustrating reading experience. The way he speaks is so melodramatic and overwrought that it’s laughable. This continues into the excerpts of his fairytales, which are all edgy and fake-deep. I appreciate what C. G Drews tried to do with Andrew as a representation of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, but the work put in didn’t work on-page. As an audience, the reader is out of the loop of his non-monster anxieties, so he sometimes makes leaps in logic that make no sense and we can’t even see how he got there. Ideally, the reader would be led onto the same traps that Andrew’s anxiety leads him, but instead it’s confusing and aggravating. I also think the way that mental health is sometimes shown plainly on-page and other times in symbolic imagery and allegory creates a confused depiction of mental illness.I also found the exploration of Asexuality to be mixed. I was very excited as an Ace-spectrum person to see how this was done, and I’m still not sure. For a YA audience, I would expect the explanation of asexuality to be heavy handed, but that wasn’t what I got. An actual introduction of asexuality doesn’t exist at all, but Andrew’s fears and feelings about being “wrong” are who’ll to explained to the point of being repetitive. I’ll be honest, some of my opinions about the representation is clouded by how little I cared about Andrew as a character. I can’t really complain about it though, because this was one of the better elements. The decent element is the horror. It’s not the best I’ve read even in YA, but it’s competent. The gore is gorey and gave me the creeps more than a couple times. My only issue with the horror is how poorly rooted it is within the story. This is the same issue I had with character relationships. The characters know all about these monsters and why they are important to them, but it’s only clunkily explained to the reader. The horror also suffers by the poorly defined setting and passage of time. Every time the time of day was mentioned, it was news to me. The characters just float around from scene to scene untethered. This is emphasized by the unrealistic dialogue and one-dimensional supporting characters. No one in this book talks like real people. I understand the point of exaggerating for the purpose of creating drama and tension, but this book’s attempt was laughable. Andrew and Thomas say unhinged things about living inside each other and how they’d die without each other, but I could at least see the draw of that. The background characters spend most of the book bullying Thomas for being a murderer, even at times where if they truly believe this, they would be in immense danger. As the death toll increases, the lack of panic is covered up because the school is just ignoring people dying in the middle of day for some reason. The main bully repeatedly complains about people “slandering” him. I mean, this is just ridiculous, people. Some side characters I actually like, Lana Lang (unrelated to Superman’s friend) and Chloe Nguyen, are sidelined by the narrative in favor of the riveting relationship between Andrew and Thomas. Some characters aren’t even deigned to have names, even if they eventually get significant page time. Anyone who isn’t directly related to the romance/monster plot is severely undeveloped compared to Andrew and Thomas, and I already said how lacking they are as characters. The final nail in the coffin is the horrible ending. I don’t want to spoil the twist(s) but I can stress how hard they fall on their face. There are fakeouts that are so dumb to be laughable. There is an actually good twist that is ruined because of execution. And there is a final twist that is SO OBVIOUS because it had been a blind spot in the boys’ pisspoor problem solving the whole book. The thematic meaning behind the horror fails to meaningfully connect to the characters and their terrible romance. What makes things worse is that these twists rely on the established character relationships that never got fleshed out the entire book.Overall, I can see how teens would get a little bit more out of this than I would, and it could be worth checking out at a library if it’s convenient. That being said, I’m not that far out of teenhood and I know that I would not have been charmed by this. Everything that this book does has been done better by other books. I can’t strongly recommend it to anyone.

7824002107	I’m on BookTube now! =)”Once upon a time, Andrew had cut out his heart and given it to this boy, and he was very sure Thomas had no idea that Andrew would do anything for him. Protect him. Lie for him.Kill for him.”Trigger warnings:(view spoiler)[graphic descriptions of body horror, anxiety, panic attack, murder, eating disorder, blood, gore, grief (hide spoiler)]Holy moly! I finished this book about two weeks ago and it still has me in a chokehold! Like OMG! C.G. Drews, the genius that you are!! I honestly don’t even know how to start writing this review and I wanted to write one ever since I read the final page of this masterpiece! How do I even put into words what I felt after reading that ending? I wasn’t just staring at the freaking wall like C.G. assumed in their epilogue, I was screaming, crying, raging, throwing up at that damned wall! And if you think that’s me overreacting, then read the book and tell me you didn’t feel sick to your stomach after reading that ending! Also, I read so many interesting conversations about this book, and no one, literally no one saw the story the way I did. Which baffles me so much! Am I just thinking differently than everyone else or is my mind crazy for even thinking in that kind of direction? Someone please send help, because it’s driving me nuts! *lol* Anyway, I’ll get very deep into my thoughts about this story and how it ended later on in this review. So, if you want to know my take on it, you’re welcome to dive into the craziness that is my brain. I’ll mark it as a spoiler section because I don’t want to take away the fun for everyone else who still didn’t read the book. ;-) ”Sometimes he’d lie awake at night and unpack all his feelings about this boy-shaped hurricane named Thomas Rye. He didn’t know if he wanted to be Thomas – reckless and uncontainable – or if he wanted to kiss him.”Okay, first things first! One of the many things I loved about this story was the strong longing of the main characters! I mean we get everything through Andrew’s POV and if you ask me Andrew is one hell of an unreliable narrator. Still, Andrew’s longing is palpable through his thoughts and actions, while Thomas’s is etched into his face. The way this boy feels! So strongly, unfiltered and raw. I swear, I rarely came across a main character that was so misunderstood by everyone and hurt so much because of it. There were moments I had the intense urge to wrap Thomas in a blanket and tell him that everything would be all right. The same goes for Andrew of course, because wow, that boy didn’t have it easy as well. Thomas and he are the definition of “us against the world” and it’s so freaking heart-breaking and intense! Their dynamic was so good, though! Obsessive, extremely powerful and guilt-ridden to the core. I kinda wish we had gotten more of their playful moments, because they were so wholesome whenever they happened. This story’s nature is dark, though, and due to that, we’re not allowed to see the good parts of their deep connection. All we see is the rot that took root in their hearts and turned something beautiful and sacred into something sinister and devastating. The symbolism that prevailed throughout the entire storyline and the odds that were stacked against them. It was a LOT! Not to mention their toxic and unhealthy co-dependency. Despite everything, their bond is the only thing that gets them through the day so as noxious as it is, it keeps them alive and you can’t help but root for them. But it’s not just the monsters of the forest and their inner demons they have to fight, it’s also their environment and the people that want to harm them. C.G. tackles an entire bandwidth of themes that reoccur throughout the story and they are all part of a bigger picture. No matter if it’s the bullying from Bryce Kane – a fellow student – or the constant attacks of Clemens – their teacher – who has absolutely no business being so cruel to his students, they all contribute to our boys problems and pile up into an insurmountable obstacle. Add to that the topics of identity, mental health – especially anxiety, body horror, grief, asexuality, and you got a full plate that’s flowing over. ”For a vicious moment, Andrew thought about slipping his fingers into Thomas’s cut. Taking hold of his rib and breaking it. Pulling the soft crumbling bone from his chest and sewing it into his own. They’d be forever together, rib against rib, fused in gore and bone and adoration.”For me, personally, the asexuality rep was done so well and stood out against many of the other themes that were addressed in here. The way Andrew feels about his asexuality and how it hinders him to pursue the one person he truly wants to be with… It was so painful, but also felt extremely raw and real! I think some part of him always knew about Thomas’s feelings but he didn’t dare to acknowledge them because he feared the consequences and what it would mean for the both of them. I think Thomas would have accepted and taken Andrew exactly the way he was and wouldn’t have changed anything about him, but the problem is, that Andrew didn’t see it that way. In his mind, Thomas had needs he would never be able to fulfil and as with so many things, Andrew stood in his own way, which made the entire book such an excruciating experience. (And I mean that in the best way possible.) ”I think,” Andrew whispered, “it sucks to be ace.”“I think,” Lana said, “the world sucks for making you feel that way.”This quote resonated so much with me and I loved Lana for always trying to help Andrew. She was a fierce side character and I kind of wish we would have gotten even more moments with her. As for Dove, I honestly didn’t get enough about her character to have an opinion but it sounded like she was very responsible and not prone to indulge in adventures. From what I gathered, she was an A+ student and didn’t approve of Thomas always getting in trouble. Their dynamic seemed to be a particular kind of brand and I think there was as much affection as resentment between those two. The relationship between Dove and Andrew was very strained as well and Thomas seemed to be the main reason for it, which was only logical if you thought about it… Anyway! I don’t want to spoil anything so I’ll just move on to the last thing I want to talk about before I go into full blown theory and relationship mode. The thing I want to address is the body horror, which was an integral part of this story. So, for everyone who didn’t read the book already, let me tell you, the body horror in this was not for the faint-hearted! It was brutal, visceral, graphic, intense and quite gruesome. If you’re not into this kind of thing you better don’t read the book, because you’ll be in for a hard ride. Just a fair warning for the more sensitive readers of my reviews. ;-) "He touched his ear and felt it swollen afresh, stretching as if something had regrown while he slept. But this time it wasn’t pushing against skin and trying to escape. It was growing the other way. Going in deeper. It was inside him, he knew.The forest."And now to the last topic I need to tackle before I go crazy: The relationship between Thomas and Andrew and the ending of the book! We already established that this is one hell of a toxic relationship and that our two MCs can’t live without each other and need the other’s presence like air to breathe. They already were co-dependent way before they started to fight monsters in the forest and the people around them knew about it for a very long time. Andrew with his stories and Thomas with his art. They complemented each other and created an entire world for themselves. A world no one else was allowed to be a part of, which presumably led to the deep rift between Dove, Thomas and Andrew. They used to be a trio but the boys obsession with each other was on a level Dove could never be a part of, which most definitely caused a lot of tension between Thomas and Dove before the summer. Still, the ending is quite something and I’ll talk about this now because I need to get this out of my system.If you’ve read the book be prepared to read a LONG spoiler section! Because I repeat: I have THOUGHTS! Read my FULL & uncut review here! Or continue with the short spoiler version!(view spoiler)[Okay, gosh, I don’t even know where to start with my theory but I’ll just spit it out and take it from there. Alright! You ready? Nope? Too bad, you’ll hear it anyway! As much as I want to believe that this story has a HEA I think that it doesn’t. I mean we have that hint at the blurb saying: “"Not Every Fairy Tale Has A Happy Ending" and I think that’s exactly what happened in here! Moreover, there are so many hints throughout the book that fuel my theory and I just need to talk about it because nobody else picked up on them and I read theory after theory but literally no other person had that hot take so here I am. Delivering you my fresh hot tea! Seriously if you’ve read the book I’d love to discuss this! Okay, here goes nothing, let’s do this.I know everyone thinks that Dove’s death was Thomas’s fault and that he killed his parents, Mr. Clemens and Bryce. And this even though the ending made it pretty clear that it was Andrew who created the monsters and not Thomas. So why assume that it was Thomas who killed the others?! I think Thomas is probably the most misunderstood character in the history of stories because I’m going to tell you my theory now and I’m going to back it up with quotes and evidence and if you don’t believe me that Thomas is innocent and one hell of a tragic figure then I honestly dunno. First of all, Dove’s death: I believe that it was an accident and that Dove was so angry at Thomas for not keeping his distance from her twin brother that she stormed off into the forest, climbed their tree and accidentally slipped. We have a couple of students who saw her argue with Thomas and enter the woods. Moreover, Thomas is feeling so guilty and torn for not being with her. There is only remorse, all-consuming guilt and pain. ”Then she fell. And I wasn’t there to catch her. I didn’t even feel it. I should have felt it or been there or run to her. I loved her like she was my family. But I love you … like you’re my whole world.”The death of Thomas’s parents, Bryce and Mr. Clemens: I don’t, not even for a single second, believe that Thomas killed his parents. Thomas’s parents were killed by the monsters, the monsters Andrew created in order to protect him. In some twisted kind of way his brain already knew that Dove was dead and Thomas was the only one left. Even though he subconsciously blamed him for Dove’s death he still knew that Thomas’s parents were horrible to him and didn’t treat him well. So with their deaths by the monsters hands he saved Thomas while still inflicting pain, because despite everything they were Thomas parents and because of him they died. I think at some point Thomas got aware of that but he loved Andrew so much he still decided to be with him. As for Bryce and Mr. Clemens. Andrew had an argument with Bryce shortly before he found him dead in the classroom and since Andrew is such an unreliable narrator we can assume, that he killed him without even realizing it. Same goes for Mr. Clemens and the monster btw. And speaking of the monsters:Now here is the thing, I do believe that the monsters were real. At least to some degree and they weren’t just imagined by Thomas and Andrew. I mean there is plenty of evidence that others could see some elements of them. For instance the mushrooms in Andrews pants, Bryce didn’t just see those but also the moss on his fingers when he touched Andrew. The cafeteria was destroyed after the attack of another monster and Mr. Clemens had no idea what was going on when the forest attacked him, but he was attacked by something that eventually killed him. Of course we could argue that it was all Andrew and Thomas. Andrew could have put the moss in his hands and the mushrooms in his trousers, but we can’t really explain away the hole in the wall after Mr. Clemens died and the attack in the cafeteria. I think that will be a mystery, but I do believe that the monsters were real somehow. Especially with my theory that they killed Thomas’s parents before he came back to school. I would have no other explanation for that otherwise. Thomas’s and Andrew’s relationship and the precious soul that was Thomas Rye: I know no one is going to like this theory but I stand by it even though it’s so painful and tragic it makes my heart bleed. I think both of them died at the ending. And there are so many hints at that, I reread some passages thrice and even more often to make sense of it and to figure out what truly happened in those last couple of pages and no matter what I did, I always came to the same conclusion. Andrew tried to take his own life at the root of the tree and when Thomas tried to stop him he got lethally hurt, which caused them both to die exactly where Dove died a while ago. With this ending, the story would go full circle and even though this theory is killing me, I think it might have been what the author aimed for. We will never know for sure because C.G. kept the ending open on purpose but I think it would have gone into this kind of direction. Why? Well, hear me out! Liar. But he’d always been one.Instead, he whispered, “Would you die for me?”Thomas sounded warm and cottony with sleep. “Of course I would.”We all know that Thomas would die for Andrew! He said it plenty of times and we all know that Andrew had a cruel streak somewhere hidden deep inside of him. I mean all the thoughts of ripping Thomas open, wanting to be inside of his ribcage, etc. and he explicitly called himself a “liar” in the quote above. Some part of Andrew knew that he was lying to himself! ”If I lose control, you’d stop me, right? If I’m the true monster, you’d fight me.”Precious Thomas, asking Andrew to stop him if he turned out to be the true monster, completely oblivious to the fact that Andrew, the real monster of the story, was already sleeping in his bed. There’s even a quote that states as much. In Andrew’s defence, he has no idea that he’s the reason for the monsters because his mind is refusing to acknowledge Dove’s death so he’s kind of innocent even though he isn’t. If that makes any sense? He has absolutely no idea what he’s doing. “You could cut me open and devour everything that I am,” Thomas said, ragged and thin. “I would let you. I’d ask you to. But I have no idea what it means to you. What … what I mean to you.”“Of course I like you.” It came out rougher than Andrew meant.The way Thomas would sacrifice everything including himself just to make Andrew happy. I personally think that Thomas loved Andrew so much; he closed his eyes to the reality of Andrew being the cause for the monsters. He knew it ever since Lana gave him hell for feeding Andrew’s delusions of Dove still being alive. I think up to that point Thomas didn’t even realize that Andrew still thought his sister was alive. Once he did it hit him like a brick and he felt responsible for her death and Andrew’s suffering. Thomas would have done EVERYTHING to help Andrew. Even let him cut out his heart and kill him if necessary. ”But just know this,” Thomas said as he fought back tears. “Dove’s death was an accident and she never would have haunted you in revenge. This is all your doing, and you could tell a different story if you wanted to. You’re strong enough. You’re brave enough.”This is Thomas begging Andrew to choose another path. To change his own story, but he didn’t get through to him and was forced to watch the tragedy unfold. I think Andrew let the forest take over because he felt like he had no other choice after realizing that Dove was dead. Some part of him was always going to blame Thomas and Thomas would never stop blaming himself. It was a vicious cycle and there was no way out of it. ”He couldn’t see.It shouldn’t be a surprise that the forest had outgrown the confines of his thin, frail body and longed to stretch. He used to be an empty boy, impossible to fill.Now he was so full of monsters.”And so Andrew did the only thing he thought would end the cycle. He tried to cut out his heart and bound Thomas so he couldn’t stop him. I think by fighting Thomas he hurt him lethally and that’s why Thomas is so pale and tranquil at the ending. It is even stated that Andrew is pale as well and that causes me to assume that they both found peace dying at the foot of the tree together. ”Within the ground, the heart grew into a tree and the monster lived among the branches and forgot he had ever been a prince. But the October boy didn’t flee. He climbed the tree and kissed the lonesome monster until it devoured him whole.”Which is exactly what happened in the end. Andrew devoured Thomas and Thomas let him. “If you cut open my chest” – Andrew’s voice was wrecked – “you’ll find a garden of rot where my heart should be.” Thomas tilted his head up, and the way he looked at Andrew was so tender and fierce, so full of fearless worship. “I don’t care how dark the world is for you. I’ll hold out my hand until you find it, and I won’t let go.”Thomas reaching out to Andrew until the very end… gosh it’s painful just to think about it. Thomas is legit one of the most tragic figures in literature because the way he loved Andrew so unconditionally, fully and without any judgment is just heart breaking. Even at the end, when he knew Andrew allowed the forest to take over, that he stopped fighting for himself, Thomas still fought for him tooth and nail. This fierce, brave and precious soul! Thomas was so misunderstood. It breaks my freaking heart. The real tragedy here is that Thomas gave EVERYTHING to save Andrew, yet it still wasn’t enough. T_T (hide spoiler)]Conclusion:“Don’t Let the Forest In” is one of those rare books that will haunt me for a very long time. I can see myself thinking about this for years to come, breaking my head over all the possibilities and never wanting to settle for the one theory my heart believes to be the truth. This story is such a mindfuck and I mean this in the best way possible. C.G. Drews, you wicked and beautiful soul, I fear the forest is inside of me now and it won’t leave me alone!

7363941077	** spoiler alert ** 2.5 ⭐️There’s a trend of YA book in the last 3-4 years or so that have the same characteristics: a shy, anxious main character; a tougher, cooler male love interest; a quasi-gothic/semi-dark academia setting with no engagement with the themes of those subgenres; a propensity for “lyrical” writing; a shared iconography of forests, rot, hands, deer, bones, birds, and paper. All of these books are biting off a little of The Raven Boys and a little of House of Hollow, and few are successful. Don’t Let The Forest In unfortunately did not stand out for me.I think the prose is fine: Drews creates a rich, tense atmosphere, and Andrew and Thomas are vibrant protagonists. As many have noted, the discussion of asexuality here is refreshing and tender, and it was really the moments where DLTFI lingers here that felt the most emotional and compelling.That being said, did not enjoy the combination of repetitive imagery + text formatted as crytyping + numerous plotholes (1. The twist that Andrew is actually the creator of the monsters is then apparently forgotten by the characters and, incredibly, revealed as a twist AGAIN, for a SECOND TIME 2. Dove’s death is not a plot hole exactly, but the book drops like .5 hints that it’s happening and several moments in the book are vaguely contradictory, you will never be Noah Czerny) + near-affectionate lingering over Andrew’s eating disorderThis was not a book for me but I am glad that it has found a passionate audience and I think it would have resonated quite strongly with me had I read it at the right time. I am really curious to see where Drews goes in the future. This HAS the juice but I’m hoping to see it channeled towards more interesting directionsPlease note that I work for Macmillan but opinions are my own. I am not involved in book production

YA books prioritize representation. You will spend a lot of time in the minds of the main characters, usually with multiple POVs. The MCs struggle with the same issues the intended audience struggles with--identity, belonging, relationships (with their peers and caregivers/authority), challenges, disabilities, things that make them different, etc. Everything else--the plot/conflict support the goal of prioritizing the character arcs--how the young people grow & change as a result of the circumstance presented to them over the course of the story. Knowing this will support a healthy relationship with YA books, should you choose to discover the benefits of reading it. Don't Let the Forest In is one of the best YA books I've read (audiobook). The storytelling style is immediately immersive. The "Dark Academia" and "Rottagecore" aesthetics surround the reader, creating a rich...almost decadent atmosphere of a lush, modern, fairytale fantasy. Andrew and Thomas are easy to fall in love with and emotionally invest in their relationship. As the story develops and the various conflicts are introduced, the risk level rises to a fever pitch--I didn't want anything bad to happen to my precious, fragile & broken boys. I really wish books like this were available when I was in junior high and high school. The themes of identity, sexuality/relationships and bullying are so helpful in fostering a safe place for young people to explore serious issues they face on a daily basis. It's really so invaluable. I think there are 3 strong vibes in this book, the Dark Academia, Forest Rottagecore, and the Fairytale Romance/Monsters--of the three, the Dark Academia grounded in reality was the most dynamic and the chapters that rang the truest--real issues young people face and the secrets people keep--the relationship struggles and real world problems. The fantasy/fairytale world building and battles were not as compelling and felt, almost like a distraction from essential plot developments or maybe even symbolic? I didn't like the monster scenes as much--anyhoo, just a small, teensy complaint in an otherwise perfect experience. Final Recommendation: I bought this book for my niece for Christmas last year and I was going to buddy read it with her but she binged it one day before I even got the book! She absolutely loved it. Due to the popularity, it took ages to finally get my hands on the library audiobook. I listened to this every day on my walks for a few days and enjoyed every minute. I fully understand the appeal for young people and as an older reader, I appreciate the quality of writing; the immersive setting, compelling character-development, and the imaginative fairytale story of two boys fighting the world and their deep feelings for one another. I'm excited to read Hazelthorn with my niece and try C G Drews' adult book, You Did Nothing Wrong coming March 2026Comps: If you love "horromantasy" the way I do, like Salt & Broom, The Starling House, and The Hacienda--you'll love this bookThis was the perfect book to end Pride Month :) Loved it
6991179132	This book is atmospheric and nightmarish, with gruesome illustrations, gory body horror, and snippets from the haunting stories that Andrew writes which plays into the plot.Andrew only feels at home with his best friend, his other half. Andrew wrote cruelly beautiful fairytales, and Thomas illustrates them with a few slashes from a pen with macabre beauty. However, back at Wickwood Academy, Thomas arrives covered in blood and his drawings appear to come to life, killing anyone close to him.This had extremely purple prose. This was the highlight of the book for me. Drews reached into my rib cage, rummaged around, and squeezed my heart. right now he was the glorious fairy-tale prince come to save them all, while Andrew was nothing more than a thing made of skeleton leaves needing to be cupped between safe hands before he blew away.This also had great ace representation with conversations about the importance of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as portrayals of anxiety.What brought the rating down were the many glaring plot holes. Why didn’t Thomas and Andrew tell anyone? They had photographic evidence and deleted it. Also, the authorities blaming deaths and the forest invading the school building on collapsing infrastructure seemed too contrived and nonsensical. I also did not like the way Andrew’s refusal to eat and loss of weight was handled. I know this was due to his anxiety, but it felt deathly romanticised and not enough care was taken to address this, despite others noticing this. This book was dark and I am on the fence about it being marketed as Young Adult. It is definitely in the upper range. I am very conflicted. The prose was five stars. The plot discrepancies; predictable, easy twists, and ambiguous open ending brought this down. Andrew hated the way his brain did this. Destroyed beau tiful things. It was like he couldn't just hold a flower; he had to crush the petals in his fist until his hand was stained with mur dered color.Thank you to Hatchette Children for sending me the gorgeous physical arc in exchange for a review!Bookstagram
6812264310	I’ve neverEVEREVER EVER beforehoped that the ambiguous ending is to be read as the most tragic and sick option that came up in my head. And not because I didn’t love our poetically toxic/co-dependent MMCs, but because it makes it much more powerful.This was so unique.5 Things I loved about this book1) The prose was absolutely stunning2) The descriptions felt like paintings3) Macabre botanical monsters are so delicious4) I need to talk at length about that ending (Thanks Evie <3)5) The author naming them idiots-to-lovers 🫠For this book, I had to Google “What is the positive version of Purple Prose?”Lyrical Prose:Beauty and musicality of language, using vivid imagery and evocative descriptions to create a powerful emotional impact on the reader. Elegant Prose:A refined and sophisticated style, where language is used with precision and grace to convey meaning effectively. Vivid:Emphasizes the use of descriptive language that creates clear and engaging mental images for the reader. Rich:A depth and complexity in the writing, with layers of meaning and imagery. Pre-readI was planning to wait until I got the physical book (Amazon don't cancel my order please, I've been waiting 6 months for you to find one to ship), but it's still not here and there was an ebook sale so I'm starting this.I'll pause when Elancer comes (Friday) so it's normal if it takes longer than it should 👀
6437602742	This novel is devastating. The writing is lush and evocative, the characters complicated and real and messy, and the story a ravaged mixture of frenetic energy and folk-horror fecund silence. I couldn’t put this story down once I started. It wrapped its way around me, biting into my skin and holding my heart hostage, but never promising what it would give in return. There is a painful intimacy and desperation that pulls you into the story, and the writing and pacing really bring you to this place where you can feel moss crumbling under your feet as you constantly look over your shoulder for the unseen force that you know is haunting you but you can never look at directly. It is hard to be critical of this story. There are things I would have liked to see. For instance, there are some secondary characters who we get little tastes of that I would love to spend more time with. But the way the story is structured, and is experienced, it is through the bleeding, terrified, isolated experiences of our main character, and to peel away from that to give us a broader picture of this world and its inhabitants would destroy the intimacy, the feeling of being an accomplice. It is possible to guess where it is going form the start, if you are someone who lives in the genre space and does such things, because the seeds are planted and it is clear that something isn’t right, or, rather, there is more that is wrong than what we are being told. But none of that takes away from the book, and in fact it almost makes it more tragic, in the same way that by the end of a Shakespearean opening monologue we already know what fate awaits our princes, our ship-wrecked kings, our star-crossed lovers. Of course, like many stories, if there was just better communication between central characters then, well, there would be no story. But here that miscommunicating feels natural, not forced. The heavy weights of society and identity and general teenage malaise and emotional turmoil make it natural that truths are hidden, bottled up, fermented, instead of being shared and communicated plainly. This story is a journey, one that asks what happens when our inner monsters are so terrifying we invite external monsters in to show us how to wage war upon ourselves. It is heartbreaking, and compelling, and familiar. It hurt to read this story, in places, because, while my teenage years weren’t as emotionally fraught as the characters, I could see myself and my friends and others I care about in these characters, in their struggles with living as they are, constantly feeling attacked from all sides. C. G. Drews managed to make a fantastical story filled with horrific monsters feel real and personal, and I am glad I had the chance to read it.(Also, just as an addendum, throughout the novel there are a few short, one-paragraph long, dark fairy tales, written by our main character in the context of the novel. These are really great. On their own they would be nasty, dark littles bite-sized tales, but in context they add to the ambience or the feel of the novel. There aren’t so many of them that they are a distraction to the narrative, and in fact they complement it really well. It would be amazing to see a small, illustrated collection of these fairy tales, they were that much fun).I want to thank the author, the publisher Feiwel & Friends, and NetGalley, who provided a complimentary eARC for review. I am leaving this review voluntarily.
6180326311	spoiler-filled vlog will be up on my youtube channel on the 14th! all I'll say is the writing is exquisite, and I appreciated the illustrations throughout the book.this reminded me a lot of The Wicker King meets something else that I can't quite pinpoint at the moment.
6787600713	Creepy. Weird. Eerie. Hauntingly beautiful. Don’t Let The Forest In had me gripped right from the start with its wonderfully-written prose. The cover art is absolutely a visual representation of what’s to expect inside. It leaves you feeling grief-stricken and bereft, rare is it for a horror novel to tap into the reader’s emotions this deeply, and in this way.It’s filled with teenage angst, and queer-longing by the main character, who is trying to repress his sexuality because he wants to maintain being a wallflower. My only (very slight) critique is that it does take some time to get into the main, horror, plot; but once it does, it’s filled with gorgeously creepy illustrations and dark poetry. Wow. There is such a heartbreaking twist near the end, and then that emotive ending. I feel like re-reading this knowing what I know now would push me to rating it the full 5 stars, potentially.Also, I can’t be the only person who fan-cast Troye Sivan as Andrew, right? As soon as it said that the character was Australian. 😅Things haven’t been the same for twins, Andrew and Dove, with their friend, Thomas, since an argument at the end of the previous year. This is about Andrew’s determination to make things right between them all, yet he is trying to conceal his romantic feelings towards Thomas. Andrew has a love for dark fairy tales, he writes them, and Thomas draws dark artwork to accompany them. They help each other through the darkness inside their own minds.”To write something nice, he’d need something nice to say. But his ribs were a cage for monsters, and they cut their teeth on his bones.”4.5 Stars 🖤
6976911495	"I think someday you'll hate me. You'll cut me open and find a garden of rot where my heart should be."i'm struggling a little to rate this one but i think i'm settling at a 3.75 or a low 4. while i did really enjoy this, this is nowhere near as good as Hazelthorn in my opinion. in Hazelthorn we're given really lush, descriptive, evocative writing that really sucked me in...with this one it was missing that. yes, the writing is good, at times even beautiful, but it didn't pull me in the way i expected it to. the writing in DLTFI is very lyrical, trying to create this haunting eerie atmosphere...while on one hand it did that, on the other Andrew got in the way of enjoying the atmosphere the author worked so hard to create. Andrew was like that one annoying gnat that won't shut up buzzing around your head on a sunny beach day...like the vibes are there but then you're distracted by having to swat the gnat away every five seconds to fully enjoy the beach??? that kind of thing from the beginning it felt like we're meant to feel sympathetic towards him but without a really clear understanding as to why until further on in the book. he reads as a weak, overly anxious & extremely coddled character & without knowing the why it was really hard for me to connect or feel for him. for the first half of the book Andrew really tested my patience. the pining over Thomas, the overthinking about the relationship between Thomas x Dove & how anxious he was about life really was kind of taking me out of the story for a little bit. I hated being inside his head. when Andrew calmed the hell down with the pining i was able to enjoy the second half a lot better than the first. I loved Thomas, his drawings & the glimpses of Andrews fairy tales throughout the book. I really loved the psychological horror elements as well...Very quickly me & Mikey were like uh uh what's going on??? something is not adding up... We were really trying to solve the puzzle & we weren't even close. it really had me questioning what was real & what was not. when we get to the end & find out about Dove & the truth about the monsters i was in my fee fee's for a little bit, i won't lie i felt bad for finding Andrew so annoying once everything unfolded. overall, an enjoyable read just not my favorite from CG Drews. "I don't care how dark the world is for you. I'll hold out my hand until you find it, and I won't let go."pre read⁀➴another buddy read with mikey, I'm so excited for this one!

6304960614	4.5 stars rounded upI feel like my emo, melodramatic teenage self would have eaten this up. This is a story for all the weird, awkward, dark teens dealing with getting bullied and finding a first love that feels like the world is ending. And it has asexual rep, which is cool! I know there are people trying to find more of that.Don't Let the Forest In is a macabre story where the lines between reality and fantasy blur. They follow two boys at a boarding school with lots of trauma and family baggage, and a fraught relationship. One of them writes dark fairytales and the other draws monsters. But what happens when the monsters become real? This is dealing with depression, anxiety, self-harm, and familial abuse, but through a somewhat fantastical lens. And it doesn't offer any easy solutions or wrap things up with a neat little bow. I kind of loved it, and I especially love it for the teens going through it who need something like this to feel seen. I received a copy of this book for review, all opinions are my own.
6990897412	11/10 Absolutely no notes. This was one of the best books I have read in a minute and PERFECT for spooky season!Someone described this as botanical horror and just.. yes. Spot on. It was everything I never knew I wanted in a fantasy/horror novel. From eldritch esq monsters, to two perfectly imperfect young men just trying to survive, to a gothic academy setting it was perfection all around.

6430600609	Wow, I have so much to say about this book. Thank you to the author, publisher, and NetGalley for providing me with an eARC in exchange for an honest review.The main thing I'd like to mention before getting into the actual aspects of the book, I need to emphasize the fact that this main character is not completely written as just asexual. What really bothered me was the author mixing in qualities of aromanticism with asexuality. There were a lot of points where Andrew was describing how he never had crushes or he doesn't get crushes- this is exactly what being aromantic is. Followed by him explaining that he wouldn't want to have sex; asexuality. This is something that either needs clarification or editing, and it is VITALLY important that this error is fixed. Talking about asexuality as if it is combined with aromanticism is extremely damaging to an already underrepresented and misunderstood community. I haven't even seen anyone bring this up, which is proving my point that people do not understand the difference. As an aroace person, the author desperately needs to make this change before the book is released or else more misunderstandings will only be born from it. Plot wise, this book has an interesting storyline. This was the first time in a while that I couldn't put down reading a book. I did enjoy the actual asexual representation in it, as Andrew feared not being "gay enough" to be in the GSA, as well as him fearing that he would not be able to be enough for Thomas himself. Furthermore, the author did a good job representing the anxiety, guilt, and fear that Andrew felt throughout this book; however, at many points it felt like the author was inserting themselves into the narrative, not just with anxiety but with the discussions of sexuality as well. It's like the author was trying to make you feel bad for this character very early on, and yet how can I care about a character that has barely displayed any of his own qualities thus far.One thing that stuck out to me whilst reading was that this book REALLY nails home the same qualities and attributes of Thomas specifically, as well as a lot of other aspects. There is a constant description of how Thomas "breathes art" and is reckless and how so much of him is ingrained in that. Now, this is not inherently a bad thing, however it is repeated so often that it starts to become redundant. I do enjoy the creativity and poetic nature of the writing style, but it just becomes way too much if it is repeated so often. A lot of this language is used over and over to describe the forest as well, and it just starts to become recycled adjectives that no longer hold description or meaning. There were some parts which I found to be a bit cliche, or corny to say the least. (Possible spoiler warning here? Not sure if it counts.) An example of this would be when Andrew and Thomas had that fight in chapter seven. Andrew saying "go be with Dove then" and Thomas saying "I'm walking away from you now. And I'm not coming back" to me seems almost Disney-like. It reads as using cheap dialogue just to get from one place to another. The build up to this scene was really good and I liked the dialogue that came before it, but the lines towards the end just caught me off guard. The ending line of this chapter shows a part of Andrew that we hadn't seen before, and I like that. Although I do believe this fight happened so early on that it is both uninteresting and a useless conflict. As a reader, it is hard to be interested in a fight between characters we've just met, and it should be saved for a later point. There are obviously tons spelling/sentence errors that are to be looked over by an editor, however there is a slight pattern of confusing intros/descriptions of characters where I couldn't tell who was being talked about. I often had to reread pages and paragraphs trying to make sense of what was going on due to how strangely things were worded. Overall, I felt that this author has the potential to write something great, however their execution of a "twisted story" felt disorganized, redundant, and poorly thought out at many points in the story. Much of this writing technique felt amateur, and I believe the author needs more training on how to write clear dialogue and narrative. I'd like to see the author take more risks with their writing and stop inserting themselves into the story. I can only hope that this book gets thoroughly overlooked by a talented editor.
6335976819	2.5 stars. If this book had existed when I was in high school, I would have eaten it up. On paper, it is everything I adore: a boarding school setting, twisted fairytales come to life, extreme codependency, love often expressed through violence, horror, etc.Unfortunately, I am now out of college and These Violent Delights already exists, so.... I swear this author wanted her characters- Andrew and Thomas- to be Paul and Julian so badly, but she just couldn't get it exactly right. With Paul and Julian, I feel it. I don't have any feelings when it comes to Andrew and Thomas; they're just there. As a fan of character-driven narratives, my nonchalance regarding the characters is perhaps the biggest disappointment of them all. I really think that this book tries too hard. The writing is just... so purple. Sometimes painfully so. And what is with the random spacing?? I think it's to make it look more dramatic, or maybe even aesthetic, but to me it just looks stupid. Exhibit A: "He was l s i n g o his goddamn mind."And no, I did not make a typo. There are things like that scattered throughout the book and it only serves to pull me out of the reading experience. Also, some of the sentences just try so hard to the point where they don't make sense. Exhibit B:"He choked on a sob; he felt like an autumn leaf, disintegrating to the touch."Huh?? Last I checked, you can pick a leaf up without it crumbling to ash. I've seen a few other reviews mention that it seems as though the author did not know whether to make this a horror or a coming-of-age story, and I tend to agree with that. Both elements fought throughout the story for dominance and, ultimately, both fell flat because of it. I do think the horror fell the flattest, but maybe that is because I am a huge horror fan and this is YA, so I really cannot expect too much on that front. Still, there are YA books that I genuinely adore, so maybe I'm giving this book too much leniency there, I don't know. Speaking of YA, the parts that really served to remind me what genre I was reading were the ones where the bullies were unrealistically cruel and the teachers/parents were useless as hell. Reading that was painful. In any case, I don't hate this book. I don't think I care enough to hate it. There are some things that I like about it. Despite the fake-out near the end, I really do like the actual ending itself. It's a bit ambiguous, but I have my own ideas and, besides, I like ambiguous endings. It's dark and twisted and the first part of the book I think is deserving of the 'horror' mantle. I also like that there is at least an attempt to write a violently codependent relationship, despite the relationship itself falling flat for me. I appreciate the effort and the contribution to my "codependency my beloved" bookshelf. I also finished this in one day, so you can call it a relatively easy read. Maybe that's not a great thing, but it's not a bad thing, either. Overall, I didn't hate my time reading this, but I really wish that it gave me more than it did. The premise enticed me so much that I almost bought a physical copy before reading it, which I rarely ever do. I'm sad to say that I'm glad I didn't give into those urges, because I undoubtedly would have been left disappointed (and with a hole in my wallet. Hardbacks are so expensive these days!).
6473084021	4 stars. Gory, homoerotic, and containing an ending that will leave readers haunted long beyond the last page, Don’t Let the Forest In is a YA dark academia tale wrapped in briars and botanical horror.

6278187428	HOW does this book have such high ratings?! 1) the writing is terrible and more purple than a plum 2) the characters are horrible and I couldn't care less about them 3) because I didn't care about them the big reveal left me feeling pretty much nothing 4) what the fuck was that ending?! 5) did I mention I really did not like this book?!!!
5021205740	I have found myself a new favourite author.
8007604134	O carte care la început nu pare că va fi genul de carte care să-ți rupă inima din piept și să ți-o facă bucățele, însă pentru mine fix așa a fost!! Textul este vag liric și n-aș putea spune că a fost extraordinar de frumos sau ieșit din comun, însă simbolistica?! Metaforele?! Psihologia personajului principal?! CHEF'S KISS!! Și un final pe măsură, care pe mine m-a uns la suflet, fiindcă sunt fană a unor astfel de finaluri. Nu știu, pe mine m-a emoționat și impresionat foarte tare în a doua ei jumătate, așa că această carte se va număra printre cele mai bune citite în 2025.

6806731319	I think this was just a simple case of it not being for me 🤷🏻‍♀️ I still struggle a fair bit with reading YA - I can only really get into it when it’s high fantasy, in a world entirely removed from our own. When it’s modern/paranormal the adolescence of it all is really hard to get past - the dialogue, the hysterical drama. Every five seconds I just find myself thinking “you’re 16 relax?” Not sure why this doesn’t bother me when it’s high fantasy - but I am the way I am okay !! This had a lot going for it, the atmosphere was well done - the monsters and art were so gorgeous, but end of day just didn’t work for me. The writing tried too hard to be poetic and it ended up getting deeply repetitive. I think it’ll be for someone though! If it sounds like your vibe give it the old college try
6728455764	A BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE
6825886531	2.5? 3? what a cool premise but lackluster execution. the majority of this book had me hooked, i won't lie. mostly i had questions like, "how will this be resolved? what's the truth? are they going to survive?" as i read on, i started to get annoyed by the redundant, purple prose and the overuse of specific terms to describe the atmosphere. for example, "rot" is the first word to come to mind, overused in possibly every line it was in. the writing set the tone great initially but wore itself out quickly. some scenes were great, and the author is skilled in developing haunting imagery, but 300 pages of repetitive inner monologue, reactions, and dialogue overwhelm this imagery.as for the characters, they were fine. the majority of the book is andrew and thomas together. therefore, it became andrew describing thomas in overused prose. the dialogue was melodramatic and awkward; inserted for the mere aesthetic of it. it could have been great if the book utilized creative fairytale lore, wrote about the clever ways andrew and thomas attempted to defeat the monsters, rather than relentlessly killing them. andrew is an incredibly frustrating character, and i don't mean that interestingly. he is self-pitying and coddled to the max. to an extent is understandable; struggling with mental health in high school is a relatable experience. however, the author attempts to make the reader feel sympathy for andrew before writing him as a character and fleshing out his qualities, which makes me sympathize less. (that's how i am, at least)now a common theme i find in YA books is the insertive, out-of-place therapy conversations. mental health or sexuality is never explored naturally or seems fitting for the context, but just... there. clearly set up for the mc's self-acceptance arc, and not a natural development. that's how i felt with andrew's anxiety and sexuality discussions. his eating disorder felt side-lined, something to layer on top of his miseries, a topic the author didn't want to fully commit to. a disorder to his degree should be all-consuming, yet it wasn't.it seems im in the minority for hating the "plot twist". i'll be vague, but if this plot twist didn't exist, it would've made andrew's melodramatics much more bearable. instead, the twist came off as uninteresting and predictable.
6869202475	I feel like I am going to be in the minority for this one. The writing was really beautiful but I didn’t love any of the characters and the horror/monster aspects fell really flat for me. Overall it was an okay read for me, but I can see lots of other readers really loving this one.
6653231753	Holy heck this was wild. WILD.The author has such a unique way of writing that allows for full immersion in the scenes. The similes are crafted in such a way that you can easily feel what's happening and it enhances the reading experience so much. I know not everyone will love her style, but I personally can't get enough of it!'He was so tired of suffering because he moved through the world differently from everyone else. This wasn't only about goddamn monsters. It was about how he never seemed able to cope, how the world didn't fit against his skin, how he felt too much and hurt too often and couldn't pack his emotions into neat, palatable boxes.' - page 288 I noted this quote because it sums up the book better than I could with my own words. The plot is about two boys fighting monsters, but it's also about Andrew and his personal struggles.More than anything, I appreciate how well the different plot points were woven together. There are monsters, there are two boys and their complicated relationship, and there is Andrew with anxiety that never lets up. Everything is connected in such a clever, seamless way that at no time did I feel like the story was slowing down or going off track. Everything moves forward towards a worthy ending.The characters are disasters, but that's kind of why we love them. The horror is real, with terrifying monsters coming to life and committing horrific acts. The forest seeps into every page.Like her previous books, I really loved this story for it's uniqueness and strange-yet-perfect storytelling. This one is dark, but not without its wholesome moments.Ultimately, it was a little too depressing to get the full five stars from me, but it was brilliantly done and I highly recommend it.
6051037240	Don't Let the Forest In had the character dynamics of These Violent Delights by Micah Nemerever with the isolation of The Wicker King. And the folk horror setting/atmosphere of Summer Sons. So if you like any of those three, highly highly recommend this. Add it to the list of books where I need 3-5 business days to stare at a blank wall and process.Thank you Netgalley and Macmillan Children’s Publishing Group for the ARC in exchange for an honest review! Just a side note: I've noticed a trend where people feel bad rating an ARC less than 5 stars. This is not one of those reviews, it was actually that good. I need to reread this immediately. Oh my god.This is definitely a dark, upper YA book. I've seen people leave reviews that didn't seem to be aware of dark this was, so please look up the triggers. I mean, if I mention a YA version of Paul/Julian, I feel like that's already saying a lot. Being inside Andrew's head is tough and that's a bold choice for a YA book.The prose was beautiful and visceral and perfect for the genre. The first half of the book established the characters and relationships, while the second half had more of the traditional psychological horror elements. I wasn't too positive of some of the more magical elements, but the ending really worked and solidified the every choice the author made. The ace representation was also fantastic and a unique aspect to their co-dependency (and this feels like a good space to say that asexuality is a spectrum).A physical copy of this book is not a want, it is a need.
6206499699	"For a vicious moment, Andrew thought about slipping his fingers into Thomas's cut. Taking hold of his rib and breaking it. Pulling the soft crumbling bone from his chest and sewing it into his own. They'd be forever together, rib against rib, fused in gore and bone and adoration."UGH this is what romance is all about
7801422768	the opening of this really sucked me in, mainly because the writing was so GOOD. the way the author writes is so captivating. mixed with queer horror with dark academia vibes? omg yes. the monsters were genuinely scary as well, anything in a forest always freaks me out lol. this was heavy on the angst, i was sorta frustrated at how little these characters wanted to communicate (would’ve definitely made things easier LOL), but it makes sense at the same time for a bunch of teenagers
6917950654	I shockingly enjoyed this. I didn't think I was going to based on the writing style, flowery/lyrical prose just unfortunately don't work for me. But I was so intrigued in this story, that I was mostly able to look past it. It gave me the vibes of The Wicker King by K Ancrum which is one of my favourite books of all time. But this was so good. Very atmospheric and quite frightening. But that ending, what do you mean? Like, what the hell?! I really liked this, pleasantly surprised.
7034982084	On paper, this book has everything I would be drawn to, but it's so boring and with characters that felt so unrealistic.
6890171577	This story broke me on a little pieces of glass🫠😭 I love it so much!
6967267344	basically i think the universe hates me. i was so excited for this just for it to be god awful
6340784280	** spoiler alert ** I would have eaten this book up when I was in high school simply for the beautifully grotesque horror element written so well in a book aimed at a young adult audience. ‘Back in my day’ (high school 2002-2005) I was reading graphic horror novels written for very adult audiences because the YA books of the time just weren’t doing it for me. The organic, disturbing monsters that stalked the woods and emerged from the wallpaper of the school in Don’t Let the Forest In were both terrifying and yet also oddly beautiful. I cannot wait to see the fanart that will emerge from this book based on not only the descriptions of the monsters, but the well written descriptions of Thomas’s grotesque artwork and Andrew’s morbid short stories that were sprinkled throughout. Teenage me was thriving while reading this and I had trouble putting it down, too eager to see where it was all going. When it comes to the monsters, the forest, and the creeping rot and decay that begins to take over as the mystery of their source expands, it’s a 5-star read.Then there’s everything else. The biggest problem I had with this book is the asexual representation. I really would have loved to see a lead character expressing this particular sexual identity when I was a teenager. However, I find Andrew’s internalized acephobia to be possibly detrimental to asexual teenagers already feeling isolated and ‘broken’ (a very negative term used to describe some asexual people due to a lack of want for intimacy or a relationship at all based on societal ‘norms’). Andrew struggles with the idea of being not enough because he can’t offer more than kissing and therefore his self-worth is greatly impaired and he isolates himself and his feelings for Thomas. He also falls into the asexual trope of never having a crush on anyone… except the single person that he is hopelessly in love with but can never have. BIG, HUGE SPOILER HERE: While I know that there are many causes for Andrew slowly losing his humanity (literally, he gets infected by the forest and his internal organs and brain are pushed aside by vines and branches growing inside him) something about his heart turning into ‘a garden of rot’ just doesn’t sit right with me. Maybe I’m internalizing the asexual character’s heart turning into rot and decay because of my struggle to understand and come to terms with my own asexuality in a society that heavily values relationships, sex, and procreation, but it doesn’t send a great message (asexuality is a wide spectrum and many asexual people are fine with intimate relationships; I’m of the variety where I like no one and Do. Not. Touch. Me.). Ace characters are not often featured in books and it seems difficult to have them represented in a positive, normalizing light (take Sunil Jha from the YA book ‘Loveless’ by Alice Oseman) or in a main role where they still get to have a romance (like Charlie from the adult contemporary romance “Charm Offensive” by Alison Cochrun). A lot of times they are side-lined, or a stereotype… and I felt that, while Andrew’s internal struggles were valid and realistic, he fell a little into the stereotype role in his never resolved acephobic feelings of worthlessness.BIG, HUGE SPOILERS HERE: Another thing that bothered me was the lack of adult supervision and security at this prestigious, expensive boarding school full of the children of wealthy, influential families. Andrew and Thomas sneak out of school every night, climbing down a trellis, running across the grounds, climbing over an 8-10 foot metal fence, where they then stalk and fight monsters until dawn, reclimb the fence (now covered in mud and injuries), run across the grounds, climb the trellis and sleep for like, an hour before attending class. NO ONE NOTICES THIS? THERE ARE NO SECURITY CAMERAS? NO ONE IS ON PATROL? THERE’S NO SECURITY SYSTEM/MOTION ACTIVATED LIGHTS/ANYTHING? These two teenagers, minors, trusted to the care of this school are constantly in a state of visible injury, supremely sleep deprived to the point of failing their classes, Thomas is constantly on edge and is jumpy as hell and Andrew has completely stopped eating, slowly wasting away to a skeletal state. Not a single teacher pulls either of them aside to check in with them. We find out Andrew has suffered a devastating incident last year on school grounds and now he’s not eating or sleeping and the counselor/nurse/principle/literally anyone don’t step in to see if he’s okay? If he needs help? It just seems very unprofessional and a bit ridiculous that they never get caught (except by the school bully almost at the very end of the book) and no one shows any care to them. Also, Thomas’s parents are reported missing almost at the very beginning of the book and we just… never really go back to that. Thomas knows what happened to them, but the school doesn’t and seemingly just lets it go. Thomas mentions his aunt checking in maybe once, but his parents just stay MIA and again, no one checks in with Thomas to see if he’s okay. I love the horror elements. I loved the monsters. I absolutely loved the idea of the forest creeping in and taking over. I really appreciated the slowly building body horror of Andrew’s organic infection. I just wish that body horror hadn’t happened to a character who already feels so othered in his sexual identity. That may have been the whole point of it, but, as stated before, it kind of reaffirms the idea that ace people are not normal and worth less than others. The whole idea of this all coming about due to unresolved or unacknowledged grief was really a beautiful concept. I just wish that the school felt less unrealistic, the adults less stereotyped (super eccentric, unobservant art teacher, ridiculously mean bully teacher that only targets Andrew and Thomas because… plot?), and that the ace rep wasn’t so negatively reaffirming. I had been greatly anticipating this book due to a variety of reasons and I’m glad I was able to read it, but I don’t see this being a book I’d want to read again as much as I adored the creatures and the forest within it. Thank you so much to NetGalley and Macmillan Children’s Publishing Group for granting me access to the ARC of ‘Don’t Let the Forest In’ by CG Drews in exchange for my honest review.
7942168951	This was phenomenal. 5 freaky little stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Oh man, I can’t wait to dig into this review. PLOTAndrew, his twin Dove, & their best friend Thomas are going into senior year at their boarding school, & things get off to a weird start with access to the forest around the school now suddenly & strictly forbidden. Andrew has always been the writer, while Thomas turns his writing into beautiful drawings, & Dove keeps them both in line, but something happened to challenge the trio’s bond & also now weird, creepy things are happening at school. One day, Andrew follows Thomas into the woods & finds him fighting a monster… straight off the page of one of Thomas’s drawings. This book:- YA- dark academia- queer romance & ace rep- horror & fantasy - neurospicy rep- an ending that’ll leave you staring at wallsPROS- The writing is marvelous. It’s extremely poetic without losing purpose along the way. It’s just gorgeous. I genuinely knew from page 3 this was going to be a 5 star read & I’m pleased to report I was right. - The story that twists so well. There are so many mysterious elements along the way & they unravel perfectly. - The whole story is gorgeous metaphor for letting your feelings tear you apart. & the moment I realized that I became even more stunned & impressed. - I fell so in love with Thomas. This is Andrew’s story & it’s not even first person POV but how Andrew felt about the October boy just made me love him for him. - Andrew was so well written. He was given such space to breathe in this while also not being able to take a breath himself. I don’t know if that makes sense outside of my brain. His love for his sister & his best friend but lack of understanding how one could love him in return was such an honest representation of deep loneliness. How he was both terrified of love but needed it to breathe; needed his twin, needed Thomas. Ugh. So good. - I loved the inclusion of Andrew’s stories & Thomas’s art. - The tie from the last chapter to the beginning was *chef’s kiss*CONS- I have none. ⚠️ SPOILERS ⚠️............No really .:.........- The monsters being a metaphor for grief & anxiety & self repression was real. Once we found out the twist at the end & I realized the exact metaphor I was blown away by this story. - I knew it was his stories all along that were the real monster here, but how that was executed on was just a treat. .............K BYEEEE
6785646428	I'm not going to lie, this book tested me. I used to live for angst-filled books, the longing, the pining, oh how I LOVED it. I would've given this book every single star in the sky when I was a teen and throughout my 20's too. But now I'm crabby and my patience wears thin quickly for that kind of thing and this book has that kind of thing. A lot of it. The main character is in love with his best friend, and he believes and fears he is in love with his twin sister and oh my dogs the absolute agony of it all. It's a mess and no one bothers to communicate which can be frustrating when you're in the thick of it and as grumpy about this stuff as myself.However, I thought the writing was quite beautiful in many spots and I never wanted to quit. I was frustrated by the lack of reveals and confusion I felt and probably because of my distracted brain or just because I didn't see what came coming. I hope it all surprises other readers too. All of the things niggling at me for one reason or another came together in the end. It's a heartbreaker and a beautifully told one at that. Recommended for horror fans who don't mind a lot of pining and romance in their stories.
7005302125	This book is just not good. I like the idea of monsters coming to life from creative endeavors, but I couldn't tolerate the silly romance. "Do you like me? I'm afraid, do you like me?" It was back and forth like middle schoolers bantering. Did I miss the point of this book? I'd prefer more time in the woods with the monsters....

7319737726	Some books whisper. Others claw their way into your soul.This book. My god will it haunt me for eternity and beyond. A story that consumes, lures, and devours, leaving behind echoes of its world long after its last word is read. It is horror in its most exquisite form, not just in the dark, shifting terror of its plot but in the writing itself, which pulses with an eerie, hypnotic rhythm. “If you cut open my chest'—Andrew's voice was wrecked—'you'll find a garden of rot where my heart should be.”“When I cut you open all I'll find is that we match.” At its heart, this is a story of two broken, terrible boys—one who creates, one who destroys. Their art is macabre, stitched together from pain and nightmares, crafted in ink, blood, and something far darker. One carves beauty from ruin, while the other turns beauty into something twisted and hungry. They are trapped in a dance of brilliance and horror, their minds unraveling against the weight of the incomprehensible. The true terror is not just the things lurking beyond the trees but the things lurking within them—their own minds, fracturing, their own hands, shaping horrors into existence.The horror of this does not simply reside in its plot (though that, too, is unrelenting in its grip). It is in the way the writing breathes—in how it coils around you, making you long to escape yet beg to stay. It is in the way you feel the forest pressing in, vines tightening, the silence expanding, until you, too, are a part of it. The prose is lush and winding, as if woven from the very roots of the cursed forest it conjures. It is rich with dread, with beauty so sharp it cuts, with a creeping unease that slithers beneath your skin. C.G. Drews has crafted something truly rare: a horror novel that is as breathtaking as it is terrifying, as poetic as it is monstrous. And when you turn the final page, shaken and enthralled, you realize—perhaps too late—that the forest never truly lets you go.
6134601963	New fave horror book of all time. <- Imagine this period is EXTREMELY bold because I’m making a POINTThis book is ENTIRELY atmospheric and I oh so love when the atmosphere be atmosPHERING! It’s giving: reading your book atop the tombstone of the headless horseman on a chilly October evening in Sleepy Hollow while the creatures of the night sing their melodic frights. It’s dark, it’s cottagecore, and it’s gruesome. A spooky forest filled to the brim with the ghoulish of creatures threatening a boarding school?? The concept itself is frighteningly perfect and the immersiveness (is that word?) of the book itself just takes it to a whole other level. Reading this during the Fall? My Halloween loving heart was FLUTTERING! The book itself is just…stunning. Everything about this book. The first being the writing. Which, paired with my previous point, makes the reading experience itself BOOTIFUL. Drews writes with a poise that makes you wonder whether the goosebumps are from the spooks on the page or the lusciousness of the scripture. And yes, this is scripture, because it’s actually perfection. In all honestly, the whole experience is goosebumps inducing. Yet one can already tell the read is a beautiful one because the cover immediately screams beauty queen! Then you’re reading and you get sketches throughout the book of the creatures featured throughout the book?! Iconic. Which just adds to the world building (which is, surprise, perfect) and it all just feels like a nicely wrapped present that even Jack Skellington would approve of :) And then we get representation on top of it all and suddenly, it just feels like this book was made for me. Which is wild to say because I’m not the biggest horror reader but I’m a very much THIS BOOK reader, so horror stans and non-horror stans alike can enjoy this one. MM romance featuring bi and ace characters with a major emphasis on mental health. Point blank periodt. This book truly has it all. Thank you so much to Fierce Reads and Feiwel & Friends for the gifted finished copy of this book!
6970795861	“If he wanted Thomas gone, he could deal with it himself. He knew how to ruin Thomas the same way Thomas knew how to ruin him. They could be so beautiful to each other.

6468657870	This book will stick with me for the next few months. It's haunting, dark, beautifully written, and heartbreaking. I read this both physically and as an audio, and the narrator Michael Crouch does such a remarkable job conveying the emotions and experiences of these characters. As an aussie, I truly appreciated his ability to switch to an Australian accent for Andrew and Dove. It was genuinely perfect, and I really recommend listening to the audiobook if you get a chance.This book also gave me the biggest plot twist whiplash at the end, which was equally satisfying and jaw-dropping. My heart is still aching.

6967938696	Book safety, content warnings, and tropes down below.This book was as beautiful as it was unsettling and original. I loved every second of it. I don’t read a lot of thriller/horror books anymore, but I have missed it a lot and wouldn’t mind getting back into it. With books like this it wouldn’t be a hardship. What would it even look like, to cut their feelings out, bloody and aching and raw, and compare them? To find they didn’t match.This was very much psychological horror (as well as some magnificent body horror), because at any point during the book, you can’t really tell what is real or not, and you’ll change your mind from chapter to chapter. I’ve (obviously) finished it and I’m still not sure, and I kinda dig it. A lot of it is open for interpretation and I could probably chat about it for hours. Andrew and Thomas were wonderful characters, and I loved spending time in Andrew’s head. He is beautiful, lonely, complicated, grieving, and trying to understand himself and his asexuality in the middle of pining for his best friend and fighting monsters. It made me cry, cringe and chuckle. The asexual rep in particular was excellent and I related to a lot of Andrew’s thoughts, worries and experiences. Very highly recommend this one! The knot in Andrew’s chest gave. He had never talked about this because he couldn’t afford to take his feelings for Thomas out of their battered box and ask if he was broken to fall in love and not want sex. ⬇️ Blanket spoiler warning ⬇️ ⚠️ Tropes & content tags ⚠️Horror/thriller LGBTQIA+ Pining Australian MC Asexual MCTwisted fairy tales Botannical body horror Young AdultDark academiaMonsters come to lifeMinor love story plot⚠️ Content warning ⚠️Mention of self-inflicted scars (punching mirror, past)Mention of physical abuse by parent (SC, past)Panic attacks Injured MCVomiting Graphic violence Psychological distress Disordered eating (starvation)Death of side character (on page, graphic)Death of side character (off page)MC punching SC (asked for)Death of parents (off page) MC bullied by side character ⚠️Book safety ⚠️Cheating: NoOther person drama: Andrew believes Thomas is interested in his sister for a while, but he isn’t.Breakup: NoPOV: 3rd person, singleGenre: YA horror, LGBTQIA+Pairing: M/MStrict roles or versatile: N/AMain characters’ age: High school seniors Series: StandaloneKindle Unlimited: NoPages: 336Happy ending: No, not in my opinion, but it is open for interpretation to some degree.

Andrew loved this boy so deep and whole and obsessively that he couldn’t breathe, and the weight of it terrified him. “Everything inside me is in ruins,” Thomas said. “For you.”“I think someday you’ll hate me.” Thomas’s voice stretched with a loneliness Andrew had never heard before. “You’ll cut me open and find a garden of rot where my heart should be.” You can find most of my reviews on Instagram as well: https://www.instagram.com/booksafety?...
5021122711	Oh my god OH MY GOD what is this ending?? Being haunted by this book for all eternity is the best description I can give at this point, beautiful and so soft but ALSO THE PAIN!!REVIEWDon't Let the Forest In is a deliciously dark and gruesome dark academia/horror novel about two feral boys (homoerotic undertones GALORE), Andrew and Thomas, who love art and each other and not much else, studying at a boarding school Wickwood Academy. Andrew writes dark little fairytales about monsters and Thomas illustrates them. But when Thomas's monsters start coming to life, nobody is safe anymore and Andrew and Thomas must figure out a way to put these monsters to rest before more people lose their lives..BASICALLY this book was all about mutual pining in silence, longing stares and careful touches, but also about love and yearning so deep tearing your chest open and fitting the other person inside seems like a valid option. You could literally feel Andrew's longing pouring from the pages, but also add to that his struggles with his asexuality and his ongoing fight with his sister, and you have a nice little mix of confusion and desperation to hold onto the one person who will never turn their back on you *coughs* Thomas.I rooted for them from the get go and every new shared gaze and small touch was torture for both Andrew and me. 😮‍💨 ALSO that ending, CG I shall be sending my therapy bill your way, thank you. 😌

6584394734	You know a book tested me when I feel the need to start a review with “Lord, where do I begin?”The premise of “Don’t Let the Forest in” is an interesting one, what would happen if the monsters in our head became real? Interesting enough! Let me start with the positive, CG Drews can CRAFT the arcs to a story. Even though this book really tested me, I couldn’t put it down, and, to me at least, that proves this authors knows the ebbs and flows of their own story. More or less, lol. In the last ~15%, there were a lot, and I mean a lot, of plot twists. So much so I felt they were starting to become unbelievable. BUT! The final one was wonderful. Chefs kiss. I became so invested in the progression and unraveling of this final twist. The way Drews wrote the raw emotions the characters were feeling and the actions taken was one of my favorite parts of the book. I wish the entire story was comprised of similar moments of raw spiraling. Positives over…Before we begin with ANY kind of discussion about the story itself, one must be aware that Andrew isn’t just written as an asexual but also aromantic (to some regard) even though the author themselves makes no mention of this. Let’s review our terminology. Asexual = little to no sexual attraction. Aromantic = little to no romantic attraction. Both are spectrums, which is something actually discussed in the book! (Just asexual, though.) Claiming a character only asexual while mixing in aspects of aromanticism is just… I don’t even know. Andrew says very clearly he doesn’t experience sexual attraction. Cool, he’s asexual! And also doesn’t get crushes. Cool, that’s apart of aromanticism. Ace people can still get crushes! Please do not conflate these two identities together!! If you don’t know just research something!!! Please!!!! This aspect of the books is going to cause further confusion and misinformation surrounding the aro-ace spectrums. Please get aroace sensitivity/beta reader or editor. A very small number of people (three, including myself…) have talked about this, proving my point about misinformation continuing. Other than that! Much of this book needs an overhaul or an editor. Probably the latter. In order for this not to be a jumble of words, I’ll try my best to keep this concise. One of my biggest issues with this book is the repetition. From devil kissed curls to mud, it all felt too much. There was a lot of repetition in the way metaphors and the contents within them were written too. A lot of bones, teeth, vines, ribs, blood, etc were employed to give a certain vibe to the overall feel of the story… and I found it quite frankly irritating the more I progressed. Drews is a wonderful writer, no doubt about that, but I wish they would’ve taken more risks within the writing of Don’t Let the Forest in. Varied sentence structure/length, switching up the flow of literary devices, tweaking descriptions of characters/scenes/events, things like that are what I feel would benefit the more from a little more… oomph. Moving away from discussions of sexuality and repetition, I’d like to bring up the topic of bullying and discrimination within Don’t Let the Forest In. I dont know how to articulate this the way I want but I’ll try my best. WHY IS ANDREW DISCRIMINATED AGAINST MORE THAN THE QUEER WOMEN OF COLOR?? Thank you. Now, I’m not trying to say that Australians in American schools don’t get bullied for having a foreign accent, different manors of speech, etc, etc, but you cannot sit there, look me in my eyes, and tell me with your whole heart and soul that Andrew gets called “Vegemite boy”? I’m going to leave it at that. The more “realistic/believable”(?) discrimination came to in the form of remarks by Bryce at Andrew and Thomas about them being queer. For some reason, these came up less than Andrew’s Australian identity…Final piece in this segment. Why was there just a random, casual nod to slavery/indentured servitude? Roughly paraphrasing here but the line read something to the effect of “The small halls were a relic of past days when servants had to quickly get around so as to not disturb the lord of the manor.” It’s such a small detail that’s I’m surprised I even noticed it, but it just bugged me. To have the setting be in middle-of-nowhere Virginia and to bring this up with no reason other than to make a nod to the schools past usage felt like an interesting choice, to say the least. For my final bit of ramblings, I need to bring up the amount of plot holes, things that just didn’t make sense, and things that made me cock my left brow and sigh. *Slight spoilers from here on out*!! - Thomas and Andrew’s relationship beginning the book. Why do I care that they’re fighting? We, the readers, just met them and have no context as to what their relationship was prior to their fight. We’re only told that they’re best friends, not shown! By chapter seven they’re on a full blown fight and I couldn’t understand why I was supposed to care. - Why are the monsters never actually explained? Were they real, or just something out of the traumatized psyches of Andrew and Thomas? Where did they actually come from? And more coming up right after our commercial break. But in all seriousness, I’m left wanting much more explanation and world building. You cannot “leave something up to interpretation” if there’s lackluster explanation and nothing tied into it. - There were two big “plot points” that didn’t make sense or tie into the narrative at all. Those being: Thomas’s abusive parents and Andrew’s eating disorder. Both were thrown into the story clumsily and it read like an early draft of work where you’re writing stuff to jog your memory later to fully flesh it out. - Late time I checked, one cannot cut teeth on ribcage bones but… you do you ig- This one was just funny to me but “She probably thought him a bigot” my guy JUMPED at a pride flag ofc she’s gonna think you a bigot smh. In such a story as this with the language being serious, having such a modern term will throw the reader off, and possibly make the laugh… However, I did enjoy the discussion of not feeling “gay enough” to participate in something as simple as GSA! Very good. Needed more of that. - Stuttering… I’m good, no thank you. (Honorable mentions: stuff like SLAMSLAMSLAM.)- Flowery and very pretty, yet ultimately meaningless and confusing, language. My aphantasic ass couldn’t even conjure anything for what the damn monsters looked like.- And finally, telling right after showing. Yeeowch All in all, I caught myself saying “You can’t just say perchance” too many times to count. 2/5
7002257272	I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It was pretty good and I loved that it incorporated the topics of asexuality and eating disorders, albeit scantily. The writing was very purple prose but I found that it worked really well in this case. The descriptions in the book were so vivid, so real I could almost taste it. What I loved the most was how utterly exhausting it felt to be in Andrew's head. It really brought to life how general anxiety and social anxiety feels. I absolutely loved him to pieces. Every single moment of the book kept my interest, mostly due to Michael Crouch's narration. He conveyed emotions so well that I wasn't bored. I highly recommend!!

Я в захваті!Уже декілька хвилин пишу тут шось ще, потім видаляю, пишу знову і знову видаляю, бо досі в ступорі від прослуханого (я слухала аудіокнигу)Саме такі книжки хочеться обговорювати на книжкових клубах, хочеться обліпити кожну сторінку стікерами і попідкреслювати купу ліричних цитат і розписувати в щоденнику приховані сенси.

Taking hold of his rib and breaking it. Pulling the soft crumbling bone from his chest and sewing it into his own. They’d be forever together, rib against rib, fused in gore and bone and adoration”

7045408029	This was genuinely one of the best reads I've had the pleasure of absorbing right into my brain in a long time. I knew little about it but the cover is just superb, and I'm a superficial person when it comes to that. But the content is even better and I might be mildly obsessed.In a way, Don't Let The Forest In reminded me of another one of my ya favourites: K. Ancrum's The Wicker King. Both depict toxic codependency between two teenage boys and best friends in a really creative, fantastical way that packs a punch, both are the kind of stories that stay with the reader long after they've finished the book. This one is very much a horror story too, though, and the horror elements are incredible.The book tells the story of Andrew who loves his twin sister and his very best friend and roommate, Thomas - the boy with hair like autumn leaves. All of them go to an elite private school where they stay most of the year. While Andrew is the shy wallflower type, Thomas is a troublemaker, and they would both die - and kill - for each other. Literally. Andrew also writes very dark and gruesome fairytale stories and Thomas, a talented artist, draws them. All is well until the new school year begins and suddenly, Thomas and Andrew's sister seem to have had a fight that puts a strain on their friendship, and also, the monsters Thomas is drawing are coming to life. Hence the horror begins.The writing is very flowery, but absolutely gorgeous and befitting of the story told. This book is an emotional experience, even though admittedly there are a few very predictable twists and minor plot holes throughout the story. The vibes, the horror of it all, the exploration of both Andrew's asexuality and the relationship between Andrew and Thomas that turns into an exploration of much more, it all makes up for it, though. I could not put this book down and it'll live with me for a long time.So yeah, 5 stars, easy, and a new autobuy author.Many thanks to Feiwel & Friends and Netgalley for the amazing arc!
