3658201529	I am an empty shell of my former self 😃Chloe you're paying for my therapy bills <3This is the 2nd time in my life that I’ve been this heartbroken over a book. Literally it was a full out sob-fest for me reading this.I don't think I will ever truly recover and really I should've known better but of course I foolishly hoped. My heart has been stomped on, torn into pieces and thrown into an explosion. I actually wasn't expecting to be this heartbroken like WHY did I go ahead and fall in love with every single one of these characters?? I was literally setting myself up for pain *sobs* But oh, isn't that the beauty of reading? To fall in love only to have your heart broken.Just the way I got trolled so badly, like some of the events actually had me thinking otherwise but oh no no🤡 I am now and forever depressed™I can literally imagine this was how Chloe was when she wrote OVE:The monster of Shanghai who?? I only know Miss Chloe Gong *sobbing* (Warning: There will be spoiler from the 1st book, These Violent Delights!!) ═══*.·:·.☽✧ ❀ ✧☾.·:·.*═══ "A rose is a rose, even by another name. But we choose whether we will offer beauty to the world, or if we will use our thorns to sting." 1927 Shanghai and the city is at the brink of complete chaos. Sightings of monsters have re-emerged, the Communists have grown more bold, and the two gangs ruling the city have gone at each other out for more blood than usual. Meanwhile, Juliette Cai is having to watch her every step in the face of Tyler--her cousin just waiting to find reason to declare Juliette a traitor and become heir to the Scarlet Gang--and watch for Roma Montagov who is out for revenge after the death of Marshall Seo. Oh and also worry about the appearances of monsters and state of the city. Life is stressful for Juliette :(I won't go into anymore details of the plot because ✨spoilers✨ BUT OMG THE WAY IT GRIPPED ME FROM THE START?? It took me a while to get into TVD but this!! Literally there wasn't a moment in this book I didn't love. I was a ball of anxiety the whole time. of course my heart was also dying because of the wholesomeness and very few precious scenes And like I actually dropped my expectations for this because I thought and feared it wouldn't be that good but oh how very, very wrong I was.The characters were so much more fleshed out here?? I already liked them before in TVD but I was just so so in love with them all here to the point where I'd straight up be PRAYING they'd survive😭 Benedikt, Marshall, Kathleen... I didn't think it was possible to adore them all so much, my heart is so full of love. And don't even get me started on the two stars who went from enemies-to-lovers-to-enemies in TVD sdfsfgs THE ANGST. "She was not fighting for love. She was protecting her own, everyone else's be damned." THIS QUEEN. Did I believe it to be possible for Juliette to be even more of a queen than she already was? No. Did it happen anyways? HELL YES. All the pain she had to go through, making Roma believe that she had actually killed Marshall and subjecting herself to his hatred *sobbing* And it was all to protect him and the city. And then also having to deal with that bastard Tyler along with her own family and people having not so much faith in her ugh. Juliette hiding away any signs of weakness because people were always watching was so heartbreaking. She couldn't give her people any more reason to doubt her then they already do. Kathleen being the only one she could be herself with, always there for her🥺You know that moment when you have so much to say that you don't know how to write it all out? That's me right now. Just know if you loved Juliette before, you will definitely love her even more now. "And maybe he was a coward. He was a coward who wouldn't stop loving a wicked thing." ROMA, MY LOVE. Oh my god, he's such a cinnamon roll that must be protected at all costs. The hatred and love he felt towards Juliette hurt my soul. Even after seeing Juliette "kill" Marshall, a small part of him believed that there was more to it AND HOW RIGHT THAT FEELING WAS. Of course, Juliette tried as hard as ever to extinguish that feeling but still sdfdgsgds THE ANGST BETWEEN THE TWO. "Only he knew if he screamed I hate you, what he really meant was I love you. I still love you so much that I hate you for it." Enemies-to-lovers-to-enemies at its peak😩The first book's romance wasn't a really big focus BUT HERE?? God, the tension was literally killing me. So many times my heart stopped because of these two😭 The two heirs of rival gangs who dared to love one another <3(credit: @polarts_) "And if you are gunned down because you want to fight a war that doesn't belong to you, I will never forgive this city. I will tear it down to pieces, and you will be to blame! When the ship is in a heated argument and then one of them breaks and yells "because I love you!" sdfsfgsgs MY HEART I LOVED THIS SCENE SO MUCH IT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED. (view spoiler)[The only crime was that IT TOOK SO LONG for the confession😭 like the last 70 pages?? that is just too cruel (hide spoiler)]The amount of pain I was in during this whole book like not only did I have suffer watching Roma and Juliette BUT ALSO BENEDIKT WAS SO BROKEN IT HURT. Believing Marshall to be dead completely destroyed him and the whole time throughout I was just screaming "he's alive Benedikt, he's alive!!" That was honestly just true torture knowing Marshall was alive. Benedikt being so reckless about his life like no Ben what are you doing😭 And meanwhile, there's Marshall -- AKA MY PRECIOUS BEAN -- who missed everyone, but of course Ben the most🥺 The two being apart pained me so much, like why can't everyone just be happy?? Is that too much to ask for?? Stan BenMars forever <3(credit: @Kirisy_art)Also let it be remembered that Benedikt is and forever will be the only sensible one of the whole group. (view spoiler)[He literally stopped each and everyone of them (in terms of Roma, Juliette, and Marshall) from trying to kill themselves please he really got sick of the self-sacrificing😭 (hide spoiler)] "Keep fighting for love. It is worth it." ALSO LET ME JUST SCREAM ABOUT JULIETTE AND MARSHALL'S FRIENDSHIP. It was so beautiful, sweet, and just everything omg I loved it so so so much. Their banter was like one between siblings and the way my heart was about to burst😭 IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. Literally all the relationships between the characters were so so amazing, I can't choose a favourite it's impossible. "And yet wasn't that the root of all hatred? Wasn't that what made it so vicious? There was never a reason. Never a good one. Never a fair one." Kathleen Lang, please marry me. She's literally such a genuine and kind-hearted person just how?? Such a morally good character and the development she went through by the end of this book???🥺 I was actually about to cry. Also, Juliette and her just have the most wholesome friendship ever, there was moment between them that made me so emotional, get a friend like Kathleen😭 (view spoiler)[And I can so bet on my life that either her or Alisa is going to be the main character in Foul Lady Fortune!! (im thinking Alisa more tho) (hide spoiler)]Also this is totally off-topic but I'm WHEEZING at how I said at the end of my These Violent Delights review how my loyalty will forever lie with the Scarlet Gang... HAHA no the Scarlet Gang can go to hell :)Correction: My loyalty forever lies with Roma and Juliette <3 They are true leaders. ↓ MAJOR SPOILERS FOR OVE IN THIS SECTION ↓ ═══*.·:·.☽✧ ❀ ✧☾.·:·.*═══ "Keep fighting for love. Juliette had wanted to be selfish, had wanted to run. But this was their love⁠—violent and bloody. This city was their love. They couldn't deny their upbringings as the heirs of Shanghai, as two pieces of a throne. What was left of their love if they rejected that? How could they live with themselves, look at each other, knowing they had been presented a choice and gone against who they were at the core." I legit can't even write their names without tears blurring my vision. LIKE I'M ACTUALLY STRUGGLING WRITING THIS RIGHT NOW TRYING TO SEE. It's so heartbreaking my heart physically hurts. All they wanted was to live happy, alone and free from the blood feud ohmygod AND THEY EVEN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN AWAY, but oh Roma and Juliette were too noble for their own good and I both love and hate them for that. They just wanted to love each other freely. They just wanted peace, and they couldn't even have that. I'M SOBBING. They gave up their lives for the city that caused them so much pain. PLEASE HOW ARE ROMA AND JULIETTE SO GOOD??And like obviously it shouldn't have been a surprise they were going to die considering it was a retelling of R&J. Like even the foreshadowing made it obvious BUT I STILL FOOLISHLY HOPED CHLOE WOULD SPARE OUR HEARTS. It wouldn't have been an accurate retelling if she hadn't followed through BUT STILL😭😭 It pains me so so much and I just want to crawl into a hole and die because those two so deserved all the happiness in this world.I WANTED BENMARS AND ROMAJULIETTE TO LIVE NEXT TO EACH OTHER, HAVE KIDS, AND GROW OLD TOGETHER HAPPY THIS ISN'T FAIR, THIS PAIN IS ILLEGAL. I love that Roma and Juliette got to at least die together holding hands and knowing that both of their cousins were dead at least but omg I will never recover from this. And the gangs were disbanded because of their deaths so at least that's something😭They were only married for one day before they died *sobbing* Chloe you're too cruel. "In this life they had been born enemies. In this life they had blood for miles between them, wide enough to run a river, deep enough to forge a valley. In the next, maybe there would be peace." ═══*.·:·.☽✧ ❀ ✧☾.·:·.*═══This review was a chaotic mess, so you can tell just how much this book destroyed me. It's been months since a book made me feel this way and I don't know if I should be thanking or cursing Chloe. Either way, STAN THIS QUEEN FOR MAKING ME FEEL LIKE THIS. I will forever remember each of these lovable characters and absolutely can't wait for Foul Lady Fortune which hopefully won't break me as much as OVE did. lies, the masochist in me hopes for thatNow, time to go through the stages of grief... except in this case, I'll never get to the 5th✌Thank you Simon & Schuster Canada for sending me an ARC in exchange for an honest review!

3666742648	If you thought THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS was incredible, then Book 2 is going to blow you out of the water. I'm incredibly lucky in that I am one of the first people to read an early copy of this book, and I genuinely treasure this experience beyond words. I can't wait for everyone to read this masterpiece. I am in such awe of this book and am certain all of these characters will live in my heart long beyond the completion of this story. I cried, I laughed, I screamed, I loved. And truly, what more can you ask for in a book?More than anything, this book reminded me that at the heart of it all, daring to love is bravest thing we can ever do. Chloe Gong has built a tale wondrous enough to rival Shakespeare. (He's been real quiet since THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS came out...)

4340971041	Alexa, play The Great War by Taylor Swift.SHAKESPEARE WISHES HE WAS CHLOE GONG. HE COULD NEVER WRITE THIS MASTERPIECE.So, it took me a while to finish this book (more than a fucking year) and it was because I knew what was going to happen... And honestly I wasn't ready. As I said in my review of These Violent Delights , Romeo and Juliet was my first book, and Roma my very first crush, like ever. Holy shit, my mum had to see me cry for him like for 3 hours...Book 1 made me cry slightly, but book 2 broke me like a fucking promise. I said what I said.I knew how this was gonna end. I knew it was gonna break my heart and shatter it into million of small pieces. I knew I was gonna cry like a bitch because I'm a cancer with pisces moon, which means I cry a lot, lmao... And still, I read this book.I'm a masochist, I can see it now.Dear Chloe, please let me live like a delusional and let me have my happy ending, pretending that my Juliette and Roma lived forever happy.

4093783647	Will Roma and Juliette have a new fate in this updated retelling of the classic?Set in Shanghai in 1927, there are two feuding families, the White Flowers and the Scarlets. Roma Montagov is the heir to the White Flowers while Juliette Cai is the heir to the Scarlets. These star-crossed lovers are determined to find a way to protect the city from various forces - the monsters, politics, and even their own families. What fate lies in store for these two?Our Violent Ends is the second book from Chloe Gong following her debut novel, These Violent Delights. Although I did read the first book about a year ago, Our Violent Ends heavily referenced to some events from the first book that I regretted not rereading it before diving into the second book.Ms. Gong is oozing with talent. She has such a vast vocabulary and a very strong command of verbs. When I started to get bored, I would highlight the words that we all know but don't use very often in our everyday language. In this book, Ms. Gong went beyond the traditional fan fiction and crafted a new story.The book could have benefited from better pacing, and the book was overly long at nearly 500 pages. There were too many different sub-plots going on. There were multiple power struggles, multiple love stories, and multiple battles and enemies. The ending was also a huge disappointment, not very memorable. It almost felt like the author ran out of steam by the end. Overall, although Our Violent Ends dragged at times, Ms. Gong's prose was quite delightful, and it was refreshing to see the author craft an original tale.2024 Reading ScheduleJan MiddlemarchFeb The Grapes of WrathMar Oliver TwistApr Madame BovaryMay A Clockwork OrangeJun PossessionJul The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug Crime and PunishmentSep Heart of DarknessOct Moby-DickNov Far From the Madding CrowdDec A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta
4214107424	i mean, given the title and knowing how the story of romeo and juliet ends, i shouldnt be so mad about how everything plays out in this… but i am.and im probably just bitter about it because i wanted a strong, happy ending to offset how meh i felt about the rest of the book. mainly because i couldnt care less about the historical revolution happening in shanghai at the time. the communists vs. the revolutionists is not a subplot i care about, especially when the book is as long and drawn out as this one is. give me more gang fights, give me more monsters, give me more betrayals. basically, just give me the first book again. lol. but i suppose i cant complain that the story sticks to the heart of the story of romeo and juliet and does so in a very unique way. i have no doubt many readers will love this conclusion to a very entertaining duology. i just wish i personally cared about it more. :/thanks, simon and schuster, for the ARC!↠ 3.5 stars
3676276495	↠ 5 starsIt's 1927, and Shanghai stands divided by blood. Allied to the Scarlet Gang through family ties, Juliette Cai gambles the safety of those around her to protect those she loves from the inevitable fallout. Having chosen a necessary betrayal over her own heart, Juliette is completely undone, possessed by an impossible need to prevail against the White Flowers and her own family. Roma Montagov believes her cruelty for the supposed murder of his comrade, but Juliette must keep up the game if she ever hopes to keep her cousin from ousting her as the Scarlet Gang's heir. Deep within the city, something far more dangerous lurks primed to strike. It brings with it great evil, a final chip in the marble that could bring Shanghai to its knees. A betrayal may have torn their reunion asunder, but Juliette and Roma will have to shed the hatred binding them together to become something far greater to each other and to the city that they hold dear.The thing about Our Violent Ends is that I didn't want the ends to be violent. I spent most of my time reading this denying that the duology was in fact a Romeo and Juliette retelling and instead choosing to focus solely on vibes. Right from the start, Chloe Gong does not hold back, amping up the action and drawing an exquisite picture of betrayal and intrigue. The complexities arising from the conclusion of the previous book stay strong, give or take some added angst that set my soul ablaze. There's just something about the betrayal trope that drives forth this finale into something dark and tragic. A foreboding atmosphere that seeps into every crevice of the story, threatening to fracture apart growing relationships and the fate of the characters. Much like the previous book in the series, the politics, and complicated alliances play against the emergence of an outside threat, but one far greater than before. Roma and Juliette really excelled here, as they ultimately reach the tipping point for compromise and a search for power amidst the blood feud that has fueled the city for decades. Seeing all of these complex feelings play out, especially after the events that concluded the last book, was simply delightful. Gong has a talent for keeping the emotions of her characters in check until the last second, which drove me completely insane. By the time that the inevitable reconciliation came around, I was utterly ruined by it. Roma and Juliette have this passion mixed with a tenderness that is so rare to read about. I certainly won't be getting over their journey anytime soon. With so many allusions to the original text, I was afraid of how this was going to end, but Chloe Gong crafts a compelling and bittersweet ending that simultaneously tore my heart to pieces and restored my faith in love. In this explosive finale set in the chaos of a city divided, two people find their way back to one another and must fight against the bonds determined to destroy them both.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing this arc in exchange for an honest reviewTrigger Warnings: blood, violence, gun violence, death, murder

3818036533	“I will fight this war to love you, Juliette Cai. I will fight this feud to have you, because it was this feud that gave you to me, twisted as it is, and now I will take you away from it.” Our Violent Ends brings rivals Roma and Juliette together once again to save their city from monsters. But monsters aren’t the only threat to Shanghai. Communists are competing against the Nationalists for control of the government, workers are organising strikes and a mysterious blackmailer gets a hold of the insects. As Shanghai faces deep political unrest and a potential civil war, it is upto Roma and Juliette to save the city TOGETHER that is if they don’t rip each other apart first.CHLOE GONG IS A SADIST. My heart is still recovering from what I’ve read- a heavy weight resting across its walls. I have an unfathomable amount of pent-up energy inside me and I’m trying not to fall apart crumb by crumb.This book isn’t for everyone, especially not the light-hearted. It is dark and gory and deals with heavy descriptions of war, violence, physical abuse, bloodshed and self-mutilation.I absolutely inhaled this book and the writing style played a huge role in it. Chloe Gong’s writing is suffused with such evocative imagery and an intense sense of resolution and urgency as if anything can happen at any moment; Everyone’s life is at stake. Her ability to point at the brutality and heartlessness of people made the reading experience so much more real and painful. I loved that this book didn’t just focus on Roma and Juliette’s viewpoints alone. It also brought Rosalind, Kathleen, Tyler and Alisa’s povs into the spotlight. I remember hating Tyler in the first book but this book made me view things in his perspective and my heart warmed for him a little. Each character had a different essence and I developed a deep bond with them. No wonder my heart feels so pulverised at this moment. The romance in this book was well-executed and was an amalgamation of the slow burn and the forbidden love trope that made it all the more electric and tantalizing. Having said that, I felt like the last few chapters were rushed. It felt as if the monster and the insect-spread madness was a minor setback as other issues like rising communist sentiment and new alliances were highlighted more. There were relatively fewer graphic descriptions of the insects inflicting madness that resulted in people killing themselves so it all felt a little less raw. But I admit it is insanely difficult to deal with so many conflicts in a 500 page book so props to Chloe for attempting it.
4264785475	“These violent delights have violent ends, you have always known this.” Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (no joke)❗This is a spoiler-free review from Netgalley❗Can someone please explain to me how this is even better than the first one? How is that possible? I can't understand!! I am left so utterly wrecked by this, there are tears still streaming down my eyes and I look like my face has been attacked by bees. I will never be the same again. Firstly, this book is spectacularly written. Chloe Gong literally paints with words! The plot is fantastic, just as action-packed, mysterious, and suspenseful as the first book. The plot twists are staggering. The whole experience is a wonder. It is bad enough to render me a heaping pile of tears and despair, but to blow my mind so utterly as well? I bet Chloe Gong is cackling over tea and cookies with the devil right now. So much of this book is devastating I don't know how I am still alive. It isn't as if I ever were mentally stable, but this book mercilessly tipped me over the edge. So naturally, I highly recommend it. It's not like I need a heart anyway. Moreover, the characters are predictably wonderful. They have an authentic, natural quality to them that almost feels as if they are real people. Juliette is as sassy as ever, with that delightful cunning, and trigger-happy attitude have me crushing on her badly. She made some harsh, yet necessary, choices in the first book that still haunt her. She faked killing Marchall, then hiding him away from everyone, even Roma, for both their safety. It made Roma believe she had never had any feelings for him in the first place, even if something inside of him tells him otherwise. However, in that classic Juliette Cai attitude, she regrets nothing, no matter how much it hurts her or the love of her life. Besides, my poor boy, Roma is going through some shit right now. He is as dreamy as ever, but with more trauma than before. It makes him hotter, to be honest. He is reeling over Juliette's betrayal, completely consumed by fury and despair, while also trying and spectacularly failing to fall out of love with her. It's just not happening.Furthermore, while Roma and Juliette have gone from enemies to lovers to enemies again, no one is fooled into thinking it lasts for long. The tension between them is thicker than ever. The fact that Juliette had seemingly killed Marshall, effectively destroying everything between her and Roma did nothing to deter their feelings for each other. They might be enemies again, and they might fight one another, but that only makes their interactions even hotter. Lastly, Benedikt and Marshal are still the best part of an already incredible series. Their story is just as spectacular as Roma and Juliette's. While there aren't as many moments between them as I would have liked, given that Marshall is in hiding, those moments they do have together are so pure and wholesome, I cried every time they talked to each other. Nonetheless, even though Marshall and Benedikt are kept apart out of necessity and Roma and Juliette are on the outs, there is another blossoming relationship, that of Marshall and Juliette. Their friendship is so wholesome, it is as if they have been friends for years. To be fair, they are the sassiest, most unhinged characters in this series, so it was only a matter of time until these two menaces joined forces. It is glorious, obviously!

3882610875	(4.5, rounded up)This book was just--wow. Probably one of the most stressful books I've ever read, but in the best way possible. When reading These Violent Delights, it took me a good chunk of the book to get into the story, but Our Violent Ends had me utterly hooked from the start. The writing made me feel as though I was in 1920s Shanghai right along side Roma and Juliette.One of the things that truly sets this book apart from other Romeo and Juliet retelling is its unique ability to reshape the borrowed characters and make them anew. While this book maintains a high stakes conflict, the characters still drive the book. The balance of plot and character development was extremely well done, and if I thought I loved the characters after reading the first book, I was proved completely wrong. Our Violent Ends had me so insanely invested in this characters I was holding my breath every time something seemed to go wrong. In a way, Our Violent Ends felt like a completely different book then These Violent Delights. The author's substantial growth as a writer became abundantly clear from the get-go. Our Violent Ends truly takes you into the heart of Shanghai, and the switch in point-of-views was utilized much more effectively, giving the reader a greater understanding of each side involved.The ending of this book just absolutely crushed me. Chloe Gong threw my heart down the garbage disposal and ran away. This book was more than just a retelling, it truly managed to create an entirely new narrative that is both as beautiful and heartbreaking as its source material.It is now time for me to sit and wait--laughing maniacally--for you all to get a chance to read this show-stopping sequel to These Violent Delights. Our Violent Ends was an amazing conclusion to new top duology of mine. It won't disappoint.Be aware that like the source material, Our Violent Ends does feature suicidal ideation and actions. As always, be kind to yourself.

3779955181	My full review is now up on my book blog, The Quiet Pond.I finished it. I read it in one day. I'm numb. I'm numb. This is a phenomenal sequel and it won't disappoint if you loved These Violent Delights. Stressful, satisfying, terrifying - but you will be fed.Your heart may be in pieces but you'll thank Chloe for it. Y'all should be very, very scared. Pain is coming - and you're going to love this. 😌I received an early copy of this book from the author.
3607283441	hey chloe gong! you did it, you absolutely broke me!edit: the emotional pain i am still in months after finishing this sequel with thinking about the character dynamics and the insane high stakes of a plot.05/21/21: this was truly a stunningly done sequel and conclusion, just beyond words. the angst went up an extreme notch naturally in comparison to tvd and the tensions with gangs along with political movements brought much suspense having readers on the edge of their seat, either anticipating or terrified for what was to come as you turn each page. and of course, major plot twists on top of the angst and suspense and the banter we've come to love between the characters still woven in at perfect times for relief while stress levels while reading this story run at an all time high. our violent ends was simply such an emotional rollercoaster, took my head for a spin finishing at 6am in tears especially with how chloe tossed around my feelings back and forth like that. full rtc maybe when i can think up my thoughts coherently. all i'll say more is that i cannot wait for what foul lady fortune brings to this world chloe has created.

"Is not a game of luck"."Since when," Juliette spat, "did you care about my life?""I don't." He was trembling with fury. "I hate you."And when Juliette didn't recoil, Roma kissed her.” ~ 🤭🤭🤭Next, the writing and plot- which were both soo good!! ✨️ I honestly love Chloe Gong's writing smm- she just has such beautiful prose and I also love the way she describes Shanghai, it really made me feel like I was IN the story. The plot of this book was honestly so so gripping- there was tons of action, which I loved, and the pacing was really good imo.

3852683638	“These violent delights have violent ends.”4.8⭐️This book was so great! This book follows Juliette who is heir of the Scarlet Gang and Roma who is the heir of the White Flowers. These two gangs are rivals in a blood feud that creates havoc in Shanghai. There is also a monster and a madness that continues to plague the city.I loved the beautiful and descriptive writing, it completely drew me into the story from the beginning. This book is action-packed and the pacing is nearly perfect. I love Juliette and Roma’s relationship so much. The enemies-to-lovers situation between them was *chef’s kiss* I love Juliette, she is badass, stubborn and resilient. I’m in love with Roma, he is strong, sweet and brave. I also love Marshall and Benedikt. I really liked the political intrigue in this book, it added an interesting element to the book. There were many shocking and surprising scenes that left me on the edge of my seat. The ending was so good, but also very sad.
5101338516	3.5 stars "In this life and the next, for however long our souls remain, mine will always find yours." no one is as disappointed to see this rating as me. i'm starting to question what i liked about the first book so much as to rate it 5 stars. however, i'm not changing it because i read that book over a year ago, and if this isn't a testament to how much my taste has changed since then, then i don't know what is. anyways i'm getting right into it because i have quite a bit to say so buckle up.i never mentioned this, but her writing makes me feel dumb. the talk of politics and the use of complex phrases made me lose interest easily. i think that was why it took me so long to get into this book. the beginning was slow, and with nothing much to grasp or fixate on, it became dull to read (or i became unmotivated, still figuring out which was the problem). i’m not one to really pay attention to politics, so the fact that it’s so prominent in this book never fails to throw me off. icl, it did have me intrigued!! the way chloe does her research to make it historically accurate while adding her own elements is chefs kiss. i love seeing kathleen's shift and change in this book. her transformation to celia and shedding the scarlet label was so beautiful. kathleen is a trans woman in the series who assumed the identity of her other identical sister, which is where kathleen came from. she was known as kathleen in order to save face for her father, and seeing her embrace who she truly was really warmed my heart. marshall and benedikt are the cutest people alive omg. i loved seeing how they progressed (spoiler warning here) even if marshall was "dead" for around half of the book. (end spoilers) i totally expected benedikt to confess to marshall that he loved him as soon as they reunited after seeing he confessed to roma about it, but i was so shocked we had to wait. it was so worth it tho bc i think his confession is my favorite part of the book. i was so surprised to see benedikt and juliette's friendship form but i loved it SO much. seeing benedikt grow to trust her after everything that happened was truly heart warming. and they definitely helped play a part in each other's love story, which makes their friendship all the more meaningful. they're so silly and in love it's sickening. i feel like this book is a criticism of the first book. everyone had complied with the scarlet or white flower way, and they never really shed it until this book. i feel like they were not aware of the effect and what they gave up, especially for juliette, until this book. i think this book was such a drastic shift for every character, and how in their own way everyone rebelled against what they were born into. spoiler alert from this pt onthe pacing. it was all over the place. i think that was why i didn't bawl my eyes out at the end. i feel like the most dramatic stuff happened early on, and after that it just dragged. don't get me wrong, it's still interesting, but i felt like i was losing interest. once the end approached i kept thinking there couldn't have been anything more interesting to happen. i was proven wrong, but by then it was all over so quickly. the ending felt a bit abrupt, with the 2nd to last chapter being a cliffhanger, and then fast forwarding 12 months? please. it was like i couldn't get a moment to breathe!not to mention the characters got together so early on and i kept expecting something dramatic so i was building up a huge expectation. it made the ending a little anticlimactic but i’m glad that there was the calm before the storm.i feel like a lot of this book was chloe gong realizing the loopholes she left out and adding them at the end. i REFUSE to believe they would leave rosalind in a dark safe house tied to a chair for 2 days, no matter how much she betrayed them. like miss girl that is STILL your cousin! not to mention with no food or water? that is just another level of cruelty. it gives off the vibe rosalind's only purpose of the story was to provide the plot twist that she was dimitri's lover. i feel like this book went into so much detail about little things and didn't discuss the things i wanted. how did rosalind save kathleen? and on more, i feel like the death of roma and juliette SO could've been avoided! here's my idea: the ground was already covered in gasoline due to benedikt and juliette's stunt, so they could've gotten to the end of the block where their truck was waiting, and say something to provoke dimitri and the monsters to come just close enough that they could be lit on fire and jump into the car while it drives away!! would make a great dramatic scene in a movie. i'll be waiting for my standing ovation after this. (btw, ik this follows the plot of the og romeo and juliet, but cmon they're already alive in the next few books anyway!!)pre-reviewhmmm..pre-read reviewi’ve never been so terrified yet simultaneously excited to start a bookseries review! . ˚◞♡ ⃗ *ೃ༄a romajuliette christmas specialthese violent delights
3699364598	3.5/5 “A rose is a rose, even by another name,” he whispered. “But we choose whether we will offer beauty to the world, or if we will use our thorns to sting.” I’m honestly kind of sad this book didn’t meet my expectations but I kind of expected it. I knew before I read it that if it had a lot to do with the political landscape of that time I would get bored, and it sadly was. I just really didn’t care for any of the political schemes happening to gain power of Shanghai and since everything tied into that, I got really bored. The fact is I thought the plot was really weak in this one. The first book had lost of suspense and mystery to it. This one started off slow and then had so much happening at the end it was really oddly paced to me. “To have and to hold, where even death cannot part us. In this life and the next, for however long our souls remain, mine will always find yours.” I was sooooo disappointed by the romance in this book. It was my favourite aspect of the first one and it all just disappeared in this one. The romance between Benedikt and Marshall was top notch of course but between Roma and Juliette, I was so disappointed. Sure they had some good scenes but overall it was lacking the emotional turmoil that book one had. I also didn’t like almost any of the characters. I loved Roma in book one but didn’t care for him here 😭😭 I was so sad that happened.Again, Benedikt and Marshall were the saving grace of this book. They really made it shine. Even Kathleen/Celine fell flat and short in this book. I just wish more time was spent developing the characters rather than the plot because so many characters didn’t have an arc or had unnecessary POVs. Like what was the point of random people having POVs???? “How mighty you are,” he whispered quietly. “I am grateful that our roles are not switched, for I would have dove headfirst into the Huangpu should I be left in this world without you.” *Spoilers for ending below!* The ending did make me sad though. The way Roma and Juliette’s story came to a close was sort of anticlimactic (at least to me). I enjoyed how Chloe stuck to the play and had them both die- it was the epitome of tragic star crossed lovers. That being said I wished the actual explosion was told from their POVs? Just as it happened? And not someone else’s? And we never got a good last POV section of Roma before he died which was so sad , he didn’t even get that many POVs in general. I liked the ending but found it lacking still in emotion. I hate to say it honestly but I wanted it way sadder than it was. I hated the prologue. It was so long and dragged on about the communists for no good reason. I have a feeling Alisa will be the MC of Foul Lady Fortune, since her POV ended this book, she’s a spy, and she obviously has reasons to want to sort of destroy the government I guess? Spoilers done! Overall it was an average book. I loved the twist on Shakespeare‘s play and really enjoyed the duology as a whole but I felt it lost the charm of the first book. Either way I may pick up another of Chloe’s books in the future because I really think she knows how to write!! These Violent Delights ★ ★ ★ ★ Only he knew that if he screamed I hate you, what he really meant was I love you. I still love you so much I hate you for it.
4172390794	Me, naively thinking a Romeo & Juliet retelling would end happily: ಥ_ಥ “What are you afraid of?” Roma Montagov asked. Juliette’s lips parted. She exhaled a short, abrupt breath. “The consequences of love in a city ruled by hate.” Reuniting with my favourite Shanghai gangsters after the explosive ending to These Violent Delights had me anticipating two things above all else: Roma and Juliette trying to kill each other attractively (premium enemies to lovers content) and Benedikt and Marshall finally, you know, communicating. (kissing).I’m lying, there’s a third thing: KATHLEEN!! I love her so much. Alas, Chloe Gong is an evil genius and I was not spared. The plot was a lot more exciting in Our Violent Ends, whereas it kind of went in circles with the monster hunt in book 1. The stakes were much higher than before; I found myself far more attached to the protagonists, fearful of the danger they would inevitably face.Gong does a masterful job retelling Romeo & Juliet while also crafting an undoubtedly unique story. I loved the “ohhhh” moments when making connections back to the source material; the plot twists were so cleverly thought out! Our Violent Ends was an amazing conclusion to this duology. It takes everything from the first instalment and amps it up a few notches. Such a breathtaking ending, I can’t wait for it to be published!Thank you to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster for the arc!
4724193398	2nd Read “They speak of Roma Montagov and Juliette Cai as the ones who dared to dream. And for that, in a city consumed by nightmares, they were cut down without mercy.” Romeo, take me somewhere we can be aloneI'll be waiting, all there's left to do is runYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princessIt's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes" -Love Story, Taylor SwiftAll I know is sadness<><><><><><> “These violent delights have violent ends, you have always known this.” No. No no no. 😭I should've known. I HAD known how it would end. I've heard the story of Romeo and Juliet, but this was just so sad. Juliette is an incredible main protagonist, and her cold and cunning ways were what she was taught, but she didn't want to be like that (at least at some moments).Roma is also incredible, and he and Juliette deserve the world together. (view spoiler)[When they got married I had almost started crying, because I knew what was to come 😭 (hide spoiler)] “In this life and the next, for however long our souls remain, mine will always find yours.” YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME. “I will fight this war to love you, Juliette Cai.” I'm not okay. “My darling, darling Juliette.” Stop. You're making my eyes all sweaty. Kathleen, Rosalind, Marshall, and Benedikt are also amazing characters, and I love Benedikt and Marshall together so much, and Rosalind has some redemption. This book had me gasping in shock from twists and turns, crying because of events that occur, and smiling because of happy things. Overall: I love sad endings, amazing characters, and great plots.5 stars["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
3267598100	“In this life and the next, for however long our souls remain, mine will always find yours.” blog | instagram | twitter | pinterestOur Violent Ends is the heartstopping sequel to These Violent Delights by Chloe Gong, and i’m using the word ‘heartstopping’ because there were parts of this book where my heart. literally. stopped. This was probably by far my most anticipated release for this year and i’m so grateful to have gotten the opportunity to read it early.How can I summarise this in the most vague way possible? Imagine These Violent Delights, but with more angst, more romance, and a lot more heartbreak and violence. It’s almost as if Chloe Gong took everything I loved from the first book and multiplied them, fourfold. I gasped, I cried and overall, was mesmerised. I absolutely love how Chloe Gong spun her own beautiful version of Romeo and Juliette, all while staying true to it’s origin.Going into this book, the main thing I was hoping for was more focus on the characters and their relationships. Definitely an A+ on that front. These Violent Delights didn’t have as many interactions between the main characters as I was hoping there would be but this one was basically centred around them. Probably my favourite part of the book.The only complaint I have is that for me, personally, the plot felt a little too predictable in some places and was pretty weak, which is the only reason I reduced the rating a little. But other than that, I can easily say that it is one of my favourite reads of this year!thank you to simon teen & netgalley for the arc !! 13/04/2021 - if you thought book one was insane then you’re not ready for this one. more angst, more politics, more plot twists, more romance and MORE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. good luck you guys.———————————————PAUSE-THE COVER THE COVER OMG THE COVERthis book is going to break me
4459888632	Heirs to the two rival gangs, Juliette and Roma, fell in love. As the next in line to rule a brutal gang, any sign of weakness is an opportunity to leverage for cash, drugs, and lives. Juliette became Roma’s weakness, and Roma was Juliette’s. Then there’s the war between two political rivals and two rival gangs to rule Shanghai; only one will emerge a victor, but not without painting the city red with blood. Roma and Juliette, despite being on opposing sides, fought to save their beloved city against all odds, even sacrificing all that they are including their love for each other.It was an immersive and engaging read. 4 stars.

4314286149	we rarely get enemies to lovers twice. in this series, we get lovers to enemies to lovers to enemies to lovers. she spoils us. she mixed all the best enemies-to-lovers tropes in a little bowl for us: the hate kisses, the "i love you"s shouted in a fight, the miscommunication trope, the "i hate you but im going to gently clean up the wounds i gave you", the forbidden love (star-crossed lovers one might say ;) ) the "i hate that i love you" and oh, don't forget the forced proximity. the cherry on top was the classic, loved by all, "i would kill anyone who tries to hurt you." she even sprinkled in a little fake relationship trope. and i ate it all up.and im not just talking about roma and juliette here. at some parts, i shipped the other couple more (view spoiler)[ ben marshall marshall ben (hide spoiler)] if that was even possible.i think i love this even more than the first one. all my ships have set to sail. ok fine i know i love this one more im just scared to say it. im putting it out in the internet now. tear me down, GoodReads.

4662670770	the lion the witch and THE AUDACITY OF THIS BITCH-
3769404644	beyond 5 stars. the ending to this notorious duology was bloody, exhilarating, and hit my heart in all the right ways. i liked the first book, but holy fuck this book excelled in its deliverance of a stunning, bittersweet conclusion that my head is still recovering from. chloe gong — you magnificent writer, you. take all my money.i enjoyed these violent delights, but not enough where it lived rent free in my head. so it took me a while to get started on this book because i wasn't emotionally invested in what was going to go down. but this book grabbed me, threw me to the ground, and stepped on my neck. and i let it. i begged it to, i cheered it on because that is how you end a fucking series."These violent delights have violent ends," Juliette whispered to herself. She tilted her head up to the clouds, to the light sea breeze blowing in from the Bund and stinging her nose with salt. "You have always known this."the plot was excellent and never let up. and all the tropes? it was absolute fucking perfection. it never let me off the emotional rollercoaster, never softened the blow of the plot twists or the sickening dread when the foreshadowing hit. i didn't cry once, but i still feel the aftereffects of shock and hurt throbbing in my head and heart. because how could i let these characters go? they've grown their own place in my heart and now that their story is at an end, i have to let them go? juliette might as well stab her knife into my heart because the pain would be the same. and the angst that had me in its grip throughout the entire plotline? iconic. i reveled in it, how juliette kept roma at a distance (or at least tried to) so he could be safe. i reveled in how roma loved and hated juliette in equal measure, that it went against every fiber of his being to hurt her, to try to kill her. and the inevitable reconciliation they had? exceeded my expectations in all its bloody, dramatic glory. i could not have imagined it a better, more fitting way. i gasped so hard that i felt that shit in my diaphragm. then i cackled manically because fucking finally the death i had been waiting for was finally delivered. and you know what else this book delivered on? the best gangster father-daughter duo out there."Darling daughter"—Lord Cai pinched the bridge of his nose—"get in the car please.""Father," Juliette shot back, "I crave violence.""Get in the car. Now."lord cai is a dilf. i said it. i take nothing back. the best dad out there. taught juliette how to throw a knife at three years old! who does it like him? and you know what else chloe gong delivered on? the marshall juliette duo!! these two are some of the favorite characters. they're hilarious, witty, and it's absolutely wonderful how marshall is down to do juliette's hair. and when marshall and benedikt got their little gay reunion? [chef's kiss] perfection — the cherry on top was benedikt throwing shit at marshall because he was so aggravated and overwhelmed and relieved. i mean, what else do you do when the love of your life isn't dead in the first place and was actually helping their alleged murderer out? i, too, would throw shit at them. lovingly, of course.There is just enough illumination to catch a fishing boat as it passes by, lighting the profiles of two people. Alisa catches a glimpse. A glimpse of a girl in a dress too nice, leaning over to kiss a boy with a face familiar. Then laughter—a light, airy laughter that echoes across the clearing. In seconds, the boat has drifted away, under the cover of a willow tree that sweeps over the canal, deeper into the maze of waterways that make up this quiet township.(that quote above is mainly for me to feel something so i don't go back to the numbness of having finished an excellent series). i just finished, so my thoughts and emotions are all over the place, but what i do know for sure is this: this book was exceptional. there is nothing wrong with it. i am right. juliette and roma are the original love story. shakespeare must've had a vision about these two, and wrote down his version of juliette and roma. and so, wrapping this up, i urge you to read it. the book will hurt you. but that should be part of the reason you'll be reading this, yes? so i urge you to not miss out on having your heart ripped from your chest and see if chloe gong does go forth with the death trope. but remember to enjoy the ride and say goodbye to the characters along the way. i'll definitely miss this feeling of reading an ending that encapsulates what a masterpiece is. i'll really miss these characters and i'll wonder what they'll be up to, but i have to remember what alisa said in the end, which is not to worry. they'll be okay. and with that, i'm off searching for another book to beat up my heart. happy reading!
3697993376	pre-read: ooo a title and cover.... i like! if Mars and Ben don't get together in this book then i will probably drown myself with my tears.~~~post-read: buddy read with my dear ashley! would it be bad to say that i'm just the teeniest bit disappointed by this? i don't know, it might just be that the complete and utter hype this duology receives brought my expectations just a little too high. don't get me wrong - this is an amazing series! chloe gong is a BRILLIANT writer and i can't wait to read more of her books, and this is an absolutely stunning romeo&juliet retelling. the asian setting with the fantasy aspects and the pining and angst and badassery... it was all so crazily exciting, not to mention the wonderful lgbtq+ rep. but i just found that... a little something was missing. i'm not sure what, but i felt a little detached to the main characters (roma & juliette), and while i still loved their romance, i felt that stages of it felt a little rushed. the angst and iconic knife-to-throat romance was such fun to read, but i was honestly more invested in ben & mars' romance, and though i love juliette with all my heart and soul (badass queen), i just never fully connected with roma. meanwhile, i would happily die for kathleen/celia, juliette, ben or mars. ugh i really don't know why, but throughout the book - especially at the end - i just wasn't all that invested! that little bit of detachment ruined this book a little for me, and though i was still insanely addicted to the story and couldn't wait to read every section, i'm ashamed to say that i didn't really cry at the end (i know, i know, i'm literally a heartless monster). but this was still so good!! i'll definitely be reading more of chloe gong's works.

3769450010	5 STARSWhat a showstopping sequel from Chloe Gong! I cannot say enough good things about Our Violent Ends and These Violent Delights. Chloe Gong created a masterpiece in this duology, and I will never forget it. I binged Our Violent Ends in one day and I don't regret a thing. This duology means the world to me and Chloe Gong is a spectacular author who will definitely be the next big force in publishing.Our Violent Ends is the sequel to These Violent Delights, a young adult historical fantasy duology. After Juliette makes the ultimate sacrifice regarding her relationship with Roma Montagov, the heir to the rival gang, tensions are higher than ever. With Marshall Seo hiding, Benedikt not talking to his cousin, and Roma determined to kill Juliette, Our Violent Ends is an amazing ending to an amazing duology that will surely delight readers.There is so much to say about Our Violent Ends that I don't know where to start. I could start with the amazing setting, or the loveable characters, or the engaging plot. Everything in this book was perfectly executed and captured my attention from beginning to end. The setting of Our Violent Ends is very well fleshed out. There is the historical element of the Nationalists and the Communists along with the fantasy element of the monster and of course the atmospheric Shanghai where the story takes place. I'm not a huge history buff, but I found the politics and history interesting. I loved the premise behind the two rival gangs and the starcrossed lovers. I don't know how Chloe Gong's brain works, but I love it. The characters were even more awesome in Our Violent Ends than These Violent Delights. Every characters is given such a compelling story and we get to see events from their point of view. I particularly loved Kathleen and her development throughout the duology. I was happy to see that Rosalind was also given a more significant part in Our Violent Ends. I felt that she was a little left out in These Violent Delights, but I absolutely empathized with her characters throughout the novel. Marshall and Benedikt had such a great love story and I found myself smiling from ear to ear whenever they met with each other. Of course, Roma and Juliette will always have my heart. Their chemistry is unmatched and I love the transition from their relationship in the first book to this one. I don't want to spoil anything, but Our Violent Ends was just as amazing as I had imagined and I cannot wait to read everything else Chloe Gong writes. Thank you to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for sending me this digital ARC in exchange for an honest review.
4232380098	edit: 10/4/22 - previous rating 2/5, new rating 1/5no more chloe gong books for me moving forward (came to that conclusion after finishing this book way before but..) . i’m done giving her the benefit of the doubt & any more grace when she refuses to respect reviewer spaces and sees everything as a personal attack. the books you write are not that good to making this level of fuss, flexing your age and implying people are jealous because they’re not finishing [writing & publishing] a book at 20 just further proves your immaturity (which is crucial given the topics being handled in this series lmao). just some advice, if your books are already mediocre to begin with, maybe don’t actively try to piss off more readers every week, close that twitter app, it’s not worth it. That was something... Our Violent Ends is the second and final book in Chloe Gong's duology that follows Juliette and Roma and a series of other characters as they try to source out the new mysterious person controlling the beasts/insects who have wreaked havoc in the first book. Meanwhile, the tension between gangs rise and fall, communists and nationalists wrestle for power in the city, and Roma and Juliette have a lot of shit to get through as usual. The plot is pretty simple and predictable, though it loses its grip nearing the end as the focus shifts back and forth so roughly that I just felt detached from a lot of it. The back and forth between Roma and Juliette got so repetitive that I felt zero tension or interest in certain events happening. If I know how it'll end with these two at the end of the scene, it doesn't matter how matter times they point a knife or gun at each other, we'll hear the same speech going through their heads for the 11th time and move on. With main characters that come off so lackluster and a plot that was so messily done and felt incredibly dull (esp the middle), I just felt very little at the end. The pacing of this book also felt really messy, some parts were actually really engaging and things will be moving at breakneck speed (sometimes a little too fast), other times characters feel like they're placed in a scene to perform a specific trope/say a witty line before moving on. However, there were moments in the book that were quite fun to read, I loved the developing relationship between Marshall and Benedikt, the push and pull between the two, paired with the yearning was quite good. Rosalind was an interesting character that fell flat for me in the end but had so much potential and was really interesting given the little bit of time spent on her. The dialogue was probably the best part, some pivotal scenes had exchanges between characters that packed so much punch and were so dramatic in the best way possible that I kind of dig it - I mean this is a retelling of a Shakespeare play... Overall, I would recommend it to people, especially those who loved the first book and want an ending to the story. But if you had a problem getting through the first one and enjoying it, chances are this one isn't for you as well... (How disappointing, at the 25% mark I kept going on about how this was leaps better than the first book cause I thought it fixed all the problems I had with TVD)...Thank you to Netgalley for providing a copy of the eARC for an honest review
3832728591	Our Violent Ends by Chloe Gong is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word. She has crafted a world in Shanghai in the 1920s that is so culturally rich with traditional and fantastical elements that it left me thoroughly submerged into this exciting conclusion to the series. Our beloved characters are faced with the reemergence of a familiar threat from book one, but this time, it’s with a unique twist that made it feel wholly new and refreshing. Not only did she top These Violent Delights, which was utterly addicting, but she was also able to make me feel every single emotion under the sun, and at times, all of those emotions at once. There wasn’t a second where I wasn’t fully engaged and on the edge of my seat, anxious to see how this retelling would turn out. Every character has multiple layers that are slowly unraveled throughout the book, only adding to how well Chloe Gong understands humans and their flaws hidden below the surface. The narrative structure is written so beautifully that I had to stop multiple times to appreciate how it was even possible for storytelling to seem so effortless but intentionally done all the same. Our Violent Ends is an entirely satisfying retelling of Romeo and Juliet, a story about ravaged cities, the power of hatred, and above all else-love. Chloe Gong has truly outdone herself, and my most anticipated read of 2021 did not disappoint. I fear that I will forever be chasing the high that this series has caused me.A massive thank you to Simon and Schuster Publishing and Netgalley for an eARC of Our Violent Ends in exchange for an honest review!
7506819649	˚˖𓍢 ໋ 4.75 stars ࿐⤿ 0.5/5 spice!Screaming, crying, throwing up; Chloe Gong better be paying for my therapy 😭😭 There's an actual physical pain in my chest from crying so hard, I'm not even kidding you. This book would've been a solid five stars if tiktok hadn't sPOILED THE ENDING FOR ME, so it wasn't quite as emotional as it could've been. Nevertheless, this series has definitely claimed its spot on my favorites shelf <3Happy reading lovelies 💞~🐉 ⌇ ⊹ pre-rereadI cannot tell you how terrified, yet excited i am to read this! Our Violent ENDS?? Wdym by that Chloe 🤨 Juliette and Roma have by heart, and I'm not entirely sure I'm ready for this after the ending of that last book 🩹💔
3658225641	I loved the entire book, but the ending just fell a little flat. It seemed too open (but maybe that means more books). The relationships!!!! They’re just fantastic— the character development is just *chef’s kiss*. Benedikt and Marshall, who I liked in the first book, were so cute together in this one.The setting is fantastic and the descriptions are gritty yet beautiful. The Shakespeare retelling was also done well. It mostly follows the original storyline. Can’t wait for Foul Lady Fortune!
3729567073	i'm in awe. i didn't think chloe could outdo tvd but she did all that and more and i love this book so so so much. full rtcedit: chloe's reveal about her new short story/novella/whatever just cheapened this whole duology lmao
4322472987	sliding down the wall shaking crying shitting myself I think this book actually pushed me over the edge I can’t breath
5673412406	3.5 ⭐—Alexa, play The Great War by Taylor Swift ⚔️🖤Roma and Juliet signing an innocent autograph, completely oblivious to the fact that it's actually my adoption papers...(joking, joking. (view spoiler)[I'm not that mentally ill that I want to be adopted by two people that are already six ft under (hide spoiler)])⁺₊⋆ ❝I fight this war to love you, Juliette Cai. I fight this feud to have you, because it was this feud that gave you to me.❞⋆⁺₊A solid sequel and beautifully written. The ending wasn't as emotional or gut-punching as I expected, but it was actually really hopeful and peaceful and left me with a feeling of contentment.The book itself was practically steeped in the bloody Shanghai politics, and I found it fascinating. It also focused much more heavily on the romance than the first book did, but my poor lil cinnamon rolls needed every moment of that time to work out their extremely complicated feelings for one another. Juliette had amazing character development. She was a little bit not-like-other-gorls in TVD (I still loved her though) but her surface-level snark and hot temper are completely wiped away in this book. She became so strong and beautiful and amazing and I LOVE HER SO MUCH.My only problem with this book, besides the slightly disappointing ending, is the lgbt content. Again, no hate. I am not trying to degrade anyone or hate on anyone. I'm just stating my opinion. :)Not only is there a token couple made up by two of the most prominent characters, but one of the characters is subtly hinted at being trans. Just made me uncomfortable and lowered my rating by about 1 star. Overall, though, OVE was a wonderful finale showcasing Chloe Gong's vivid characters and spellbinding storytelling. She knows what she's doing and she knows she does it well 😍⁺₊⋆ ❝And what was love if all it did was kill?❞⋆⁺₊happy reading! 🤍🤍
