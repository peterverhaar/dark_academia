758586688	I went into We Were Liars one cocky son of a biscuit eater, feeling above it all right from page one. I'd seen this book talked about so heavily by other bloggers and how some never saw the twist coming or how others totally saw that twist coming. All the while, I was sitting on the sidelines with my shades on, posted up with my arms folded, saying, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hot potato." That's not to say I didn't want to read this book, because I did. I even had an ARC sitting on my shelf for the longest time, but due to a lot of the hype, I kept putting it off. Plus, I'm one of those people who usually can easily figure out a plot twist and I didn't want to dive into something where a lot of people already mentioned figuring it out.But one thing did nag me a little in the back of my mind was that my Bookish Twin, Blythe from Finding Bliss in Books, LOVED it. I highly value her opinion when it comes to books, because we almost always agree. So when I happened to get my hands on the audiobook, I thought, "What the hell? I was supposed to read and review this anyway, right?" Let me tell you... WHOA.***First off, I just wanna say that I don't know how the print compares to the audio and that it's possible I loved the book more than others because of the excellent job of the narrator. I can see how the fragmented sentences could be a pain to read, but this might be one of those cases where it sounds better out loud. That being said, I if you haven't read this book, possibly check out the audio version first.***Anyway, I was feeling very blasé about the first half. It felt like a really random story about a rich, white girl and her white girl problems, crying her white girl tears and I felt myself unsure about what the point of it all was.And maybe that makes me sound extremely heartless, but I couldn't relate to the main character (no, I'm not even going to tell you her name because I want you to go in blind). But somewhere along the lines, I started to become intrigued with the story because it became this strange, wild thing that I couldn't piece together.Lockhart uses a very odd narration with fragmented sentences and strange descriptions, but I thought it was beautiful and unique. It added a very creepy layer on top the the existing oddness. It makes you question the main character, her account of the incident and the entire book. She's not very reliable and has the habit to cut off mid-sentence. I'm not sure if that was used as a way to distract the reader or if it was to used to make us question her sanity. Maybe a little bit of both. Either way, it worked on me.As things started to heat up and I reached the cusp of the climax, the narrator's voice increased in intensity. She began talking faster, became very emotional, then suddenly on the verge of tears!And I started thinking to myself, OH GOD NO. WHAT IS HAPPENING.And then IT was revealed and I was all, "WHAT IS THIS LIFE? I REJECT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ENDING. NOOOOOOO!!!!"So, naturally, I had a good cry and needed someone to hold me.By the end, I was all:https://twitter.com/Cuddlebuggery/sta...I know this review might not be the most helpful in the world, but it's true what everyone says about We Were Liars. You should absolutely go in blind, with no expectations and let this book take your feels as it sees fit. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers like Stephanie Kuehn's Charm and Strange or Complicit , than this one may be up your alley. I'll be here to hold you when you're finish.ARC was provided by the publisher via YA Books Central.More reviews and other fantastical things at Cuddlebugery.
2136964249	Cadence and her family spend every summer on a private island, courtesy of her racist and classist grandfather. All of her aunts constantly vie for the grandfather's attention and favor (in an attempt to keep ahold of the family fortune).Cadence and her cousins consider themselves above such petty actions and spend most summers making trouble, being rich and taking advantage of the liquor bar. Then, two summers ago, something terrible and tragic happens. Everyone knows but Candace... and everyone absolutely refuses to tell her. And she's bound and determined to find out, one way or another. I don't want to go into too much depth with the plot because I strongly feel that by giving away the twist (even hints at the twist) would completely ruin the novel. The twist was literally the only thing that kept me going. Candace (ooo, that girl...) is such a great example of why kids should be given hard limits. This chick literally goes to a private island every summer.... and all she does is whine about it. Constantly. I guess I understand why the author does this, by the end of the novel, I felt so bad for this poor little girl, who only could go to a single island every summer. Honestly, I don't know how she could handle it. I suppose she did have one, overarching hobby: love. I'm not kidding. Her only hobby is waxing poetic about how how in love she is. And this is not normal love, this is YA love (shudders). Which is a whole other class of adoration. There's this: "He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever."and this: "The universe was good because he was in it." AND THIS! "I wanted to touch him like he was a bunny, a kitten, something so special and soft your fingertips can’t leave it alone." Gag. Her talking about love nearly made me put the book down. In typical YA fashion, she is more in love with the idea of being love than feeling any emotion.Annnd...that's all there was that wasn't directly connected with the twist. Just her whining on and on about how much she loves the boy OR about how her rich family.

1110126087	well this was all kinds of pointlessand also depressing. ugh! the writing is so manneredit is an affectationa studied display of real or pretended feeling.the whole book lacks affect;it lacks the real emotionthat it so desperately tries to conveyin its own affect-less way.the writer has talentsurebut here it is squandered.I like the premise, it's enticing;who doesn't want to read about the fragile cloistered lives of insular rich white peoplewho summer on their own private island?makes us not-rich people feel betterreading about the miserable rich.I guess? but why go to all that troublesetting up class critiqueand racial tensionsand family dramaand dressing it up in fairy tale finerywhen that will all just be thrown awayon a maudlin twist endingwith a corny moral message:"Be a little kinder"...ugh!those ideas went nowherethose ideas were rendered pointlessbecause in the end the book is not a scouring brillo pad after all,it's just another soppy wet sponge.rub that sponge on your faceit will look like you cried!
458761787	It's true what they're saying: you're better off if I tell you nothing about this book.So I will just say two things.1) It is worth reading. Even though I only gave it 3 stars.2) I gave it 3 stars because of the writing style, which irritated the hell out of me. The fact that it got 3 stars after annoying me so much will hopefully give you some indication of how much I liked the idea.It's a very clever book and an incredibly sophisticated piece of YA. BUT... an execution that was not to my tastes. The writing was too choppy and fragmented and I hated the frequent use of nouns as adjectives. Like this: "His nose was dramatic, his mouth sweet. Skin deep brown, hair black and waving. Body wired with energy. Gat seemed spring-loaded. Like he was searching for something. He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever."

2117974591	lets play two truths and a lie. ready? i will go first. - this book has an unreliable narrator and you cant trust anything she tells you. - this story has such deep secrets, even its secrets have secrets. - this novel has a twist that you wont see coming, but you will try to convince yourself that you did. think you got it?i can guarantee you dont.because the best lies are those based on truth.so read this book for yourself.maybe then you will be able to spot the imposter.and if anyone asks you,just lie.↠ 3.5 stars
1989840311	um. no.am glad to have read this though so i can unhaul it! ngl it's satisfying getting rid of stuff you've owned forever.
868828257	so, just like Little Bee, this book begs you "NOOO, DON'T TELL ITS SEEEEKRITS!!" and if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.so part of me is tempted to write this whole long review about how this book is a magical adventure focusing on a young girl in manhattan during the blackout of 2003, when all the red pandas living in the sewers came out to play, carrying tiny flashlights and shepherding people from manhattan to their homes in the outer boroughs and all the lessons this young girl learns along the way from her red panda guide about life and humanity and art history and, ultimately, herself. because i would read that book.instead, i am just going to say that it is perhaps unwise to market a book in this way. true, the only reason i read it myself was because i came across it when making YA list for work, and i was all "SECRETS?? I LOVE SECRETS!! I WANT TO KNOW THE SECRETS!!" it's a very effective way of drumming up interest around a book.but the problem is, when you are prepared for a big twist, it is very easy to guess the big twist, which i did very early on. if you think you are just reading a book about some rich family and a girl with a faulty memory and a mysterious summer, with no tantalizingly bossy instructions about keeping the book's secrets, you might be more surprised when the reveal is revealed. but when such a big deal is made of SHHHHHHH, and you know you are expecting something unexpected, you will probably find it, and so reading the book just becomes an exercise in waiting for the character to figure it out. which is fine, but less effective in terms of shock value.i liked it anyway, but i think it would have been more fun to gasp in genuine surprise at the path it took. so forget i said anything, forget what the synopsis tells you to do, and just read it like you would any other book.this should help you forget everything you have ever known:http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450...come to my blog!
2388430485	”We were warm and shivering,and young and ancient,and alive."When I began to read this book I went in completely blind and had absolutely no clue what it was about. The blurb on the back didn’t tell me anything about the plot and everything I knew was that “We Were Liars” had apparently won the YA Goodreads Choice Award in 2014. So yeah, I just decided to read it and hoped it would be good and looking at it in retrospective this actually was the best decision I could have made! ;-P Because let’s face it, this book will mess with your head big time. The Liars will make you wonder, they’ll make you question what happened in summer 15 and you’ll not only become curious but you’ll also feel a need to read on. XD”Silence is a protective coating over pain.”Of course there are plenty of hints, but will you be able to figure them out or will you be in the dark until the end? I guess by now you already realised that this isn’t one of my typical reviews and yes, you’re right. I won’t write anything about the plot. Sorry?! No, I think I’m not. *lol*”A brute beneath a pleasant surface, betraying his kindness in letting me come to his sheltered island every year – I’ve betrayed him by seducing his Catherine, his Cadence. And my penance is to become the monster he always saw in me.” This is a book you’ll have to experience for yourself! And I want you all to scream: ”WHAT THE FREAKING HELL!!??” when you finally reach the ending. Haha!And before you ask, yes I screamed it loud and clear!!! XD This story is a mindfuck and even my (usually very) observant mind wasn’t ready for the finale! ;-PSo all I’m going to do is to give you a little character description. The rest you’ll have to figure out on your own. XD Meet the Liars: Mirren:”She is sugar. She is curiosity and rain.””Be a little kinder than you have to.”Johnny:”He is bounce. He is effort and snark.””Never eat anything bigger than your ass.”Gat:”Do not accept an evil you can change.” ”His nose was dramatic, his mouth sweet. Skin deep borwn, hair black and waving. Body wired with energy. Gat seemed spring-loaded. Like he was searching for something. He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.”Cady:”Always do what you are afraid to do,” I say. ”These days she is a gnarled crone, touching the raw flesh of my brain with her cruel fingernails. She pokes my exposed nerves, exploring whether she’ll take up residence in my skull. If she gets in, I’m confined to my bedroom for a day or maybe two.”Are you curious and intrigued already? If yes, I hope you’ll enjoy the book as much as I did. It was a really nice and fast read and it definitely exceeded my expectations. No! Truth be told, it completely messed with my mind. But we all love deliberate confusion, don’t we? ;-P”I suffer migraines. I do not suffer fools.I like a twist of meaning.”

939676616	I don't know what to rate this my brain is still digesting.
4067131114	Hated the writing. Hated the characters. Sure, it's a interesting concept, but it was badly executed. All the messages were shallow and fell short. And I'm not going to sympathize with a conventionally attractive old money rich white family whose only problems stem from their own selfishness and egocentrism.
959348694	Mmmmh. ¿Perdón?Yo pensaba que We Were Liars iba a ser mi tipo de libro. Parecía extraño, con una forma de narrar elocuente y un misterio que rodeaba a la protagonista. Sin embargo, no. No ha sido mi tipo de libro.Para empezar, el punto de que los Sinclair sean una familia con una isla privada y hablando de herencias y cosas de ricos me ha hecho desconectar casi desde el principio. Puedo entender algunos de los conflictos, pero no son conflictos realistas para personas de 15-16 años como tienen los protagonistas. Son problemas de gente rica, y lo siento, pero es que me da cringe. Eso para empezar.[image error]Luego tenemos el estilo de E. Lockhart, que no escribe mal la señora, pero creo que intenta elevar la novela a un punto al que no llega. No hay taaanto misterio ni taaantas cosas que hacer para que narre entre la prosa y la poesía, metiendo metáforas y escenas intensas en una historia que no deja de ser un libro sobre un verano de amigos y un poco de romance. En plan, Señora, no es necsario. No vayas de intensa que no hay por donde rascar.¡Y es que es eso! La estrategia de marketing de este libro llega incluso a la propia sinopsis, donde se pide que si lees el libro mientas sobre él para que nadie sepa de lo que trata, y honestamente, es la trama más simple que he leído en muchos años. Vamos, que claro que es fácil mentir con este libro, porque es que no hay que pensar mucho para 'tapar' de lo que trata: porque va sobre la nada. No pasa nada, el misterio es básico y es aburrido.Normalmente intento hacer críticas constructivas, pero sigo sin entender muy bien la intención de esta novela. ¿Dónde está el gran misterio que rodea a Cady, la protagonista? Ni siquiera creo que sea un thriller, como se cataloga. Es una historia sin más con un giro en la trama que se ve venir desde literalmente el primer capítulo. En serio, ¿qué mierdas? ¿De verdad me he tragado 200 páginas para descubrir algo que era más que obvio? Y encima ni siquiera es algo grave, es como... Normal, no sé, hay cientos de historias exactamente igual que estas.Creo que se le quedan grande muchas cosas a este libro. Desde considerarlo una novela de misterio a considerar a Lockhart una gran escritora con un gran estilo. Es un libro pretencioso, que juega con elevarlo a un punto al que no llega solo por tratar de salvarse a sí mismo y ponerlo en una posición mejor de la que es. Pero que no os engañe: no es así.We Were Liars muere con el hype que crea por sí mismo a su alrededor, con personajes que sacan de quicio y una trama simple que trata de mostrarse como compleja. No funciona, no engancha, no sucede nada y lo lees por el simple hecho de terminarlo, no porque te interese. No recomiendo.
989214368	something you have to respect about a book with a twist is that it's all twist.take this, for example. no one ever talks about the lovable characters, or the memorable relationships, or the lovely writing.that's because it doesn't have any of that. it's a twist and that's all.previous to this moment the entirety of my review of this was the following: "what???"and in truth that sums it up!part of a project i'm doing where i review books i read a long time ago, and in so doing add nothing at all to any conversation

3713196530	had to give this one a reread after watching and crying over the tv show[song match - Glory and Gore by Lorde.]I love this book. I really do. I didn't expect to, but then I just fell in love with it and now it's an obsession.The writing is pretty controversial - it’s the style of writing that people either love or hate, no in between. This type of book isn’t for everyone. It’s a very flowery, metaphorical, lots-of-paragraph-breaks style of prose that’s super dreamy and a little too dramatic. Luckily for me, I fall into the category of people who love this writing style.I do understand why people hate on it so much. I just like it too much to listen.I read in the ~extra~ part of my edition that E. Lockhart intended for this book to be through the eyes of a trauma survivor. She talked about the research she did about stages of trauma and events that might cause those mental effects.And then she slayed.In my opinion, at least.“They know that tragedy is not glamorous. They know it doesn't play out in life as it does on a stage or between the pages of a book. It is neither a punishment meted out nor a lesson conferred. Its horrors are not attributable to one single person. Tragedy is ugly and tangled, stupid and confusing.”It wasn’t the most traditional sense of mental health representation, but it still gave a very unique look at trauma rep. The trippy, metaphorical writing layered with the distortion from Cadence’s mind added so much to the plot. It made things so much more...confusing, but in a dreamy way.I also loved the drama in this book. A lot of people talk about court intrigue in fantasy books/books with monarchy systems, but if you really want the dirt then books like this work just fine. There was all this internal fighting, family members blowing up (NOT LITERALLY), and tangled relationships. “We are Sinclairs. Beautiful. Privileged. Damaged. Liars. We live, least in the summertime, on a private island off the coast of Massachusetts. Perhaps that is all you need to know.”“We Were Liars” follows Cadence Sinclair Eastman. Her mother’s side of the family, the Sinclairs, are “old-money Democrats” as she puts it. They spend their summers on a private island called Beechwood Island. This book...I would call it enchanting. I got seriously drawn in by this whole “rich-white-person” thing. It was amazing to read about private islands and summers on the beach and family drama. Imagine being so privileged that your biggest worry is which one of your sisters is wearing the family pearl necklace (*ahem* Kardashians).Don't worry, this book isn't trashy.I loved that feeling of constant perfection. How despite being messed up, the Sinclairs managed to be “sparkling, sunburnt and blessed” - despite being awful, they were perfect. There was just that consistent ethereal quality.“Life feels beautiful that day. The four of us Liars, we have always been. We always will be. No matter what happens as we go to college, grow old, build lives for ourselves; no matter if Gat and I are together or not. No matter where we go, we will always be able to line up on the roof of Cuddledown and gaze at the sea. This island is ours. Here, in some way, we are young forever.”This book was unique. The quality of the writing, the expressiveness and the atmosphere of the whole thing just drew me in. Every single time.Another thing I loved was how different the characters were. The whole book is from Cady’s first-person narrative, and as you can tell, that narrative is very individual only to Cadence. The writing style and the prose would have been completely different if it had been from any of the other characters’ perspectives. Imagine if Gat or Johnny or Mirren had narrated this.It wouldn’t have been the same.“We are liars. We are beautiful and privileged. We are cracked and broken.”I would absolutely recommend this book. It stole my heart and then ripped it to pieces. The prose and lyrical tone drew me in and then broke me. Three words I would use to describe it: enchanting, emotional, and exquisite.
5335532652	with all due respect… what the fuck is this? the book spends so much time trying to convince you Cadence is so different from everyone else because she’s guilty for being rich and *tries* to do things about it but it comes from a place from guilt clearly. she couldn’t even take the time to learn the staff name but yet she’s soo different than any other privileged white her. she goes to a private island every summer and has the nerve to whine about it. the romance was weak as hell btw. i also found the side characters very bland and had no personality. nothing happened the entire book like it’s just the main character having conversations with people and she wasn’t really trying to figure what happened to her i feel like. i’m seriously sitting here trying to figure out why this book is so popular because this book has nothing. the plot twist is stupid and i probably have seen it used more in lifetime movies than anything. i actually figured out the plot twist as soon as the friends were introduced.more thoughts here: https://youtu.be/M0zBxAlF0lE
812548747	A really unfortunate novel by the author of the much better The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks. A completely unconvincing twist in the last twenty pages resolves the mystery in a way that is both improbably gruesome and also lightly dismissed by the author. The real moral questions raised by the subject of the book, including racism, land ownership, inheritance, materialism, greed, and manipulation, are acted out in flat, white-hat/black-hat morality plays by stock characters of little or no complexity. Those questions are then answered by an intruding author's voice that patronizes the reader by declaring single answers to every moral issue raised. The same problems exist on the literary level. Interesting tools, like allegory and literary allusions, are brought into the narrative, but are then executed in a heavy-handed, amateurish way that leaves no room for the reader to respond or engage, simply enter stage right, spell out their own significance, and exit stage left. Finally, the main character, despite being the pov character in a novel of psychological recovery, is a completely empty vehicle for plot and the author's voice, with no identifiable personality or characteristics by the end of the book. The politics in the book are good. The plot is an unfortunate mismatch of borrowed material. The characters are overused stereotypes. The incorporation of sophisticated literary techniques is clumsy and embarrassing.
2180840109	Reread 2022A strange sensation rereading this since I knew the twist. It meant I got to focus more on the characters, and see the subtle hints and foreshadowing. Still love this book as much as I ever did. The writing, the themes, the gut wrenching. I’m looking forward to diving into the prequel now. *************************Original review “Tragedy is ugly and tangled, stupid and confusing.” Everyone warned me about the twist in this book! I did well not to get spoiled, as it was definitely a shock horror moment. A patriarch, his three daughters and their children summer every year on Beechwood Island, where each of the three daughters had a house for themselves and their children. They are all rich, well off and ignorant. The three oldest grandchildren and their family friend are the closest. They refer to themselves as the ‘Liars’. Johnny, Mirren, Gat and Cadence. The summer of their fifteenth year, Cady has an accident. Hits her head, and suffers severe migraines that can knock her out for days at a time. She misses the entirety of summer sixteen - while on holiday with her dad in Europe. When she returns for Summer Seventeen, things don’t feel the same. The adults are quiet, drinking too much and generally being secretive. Her migraines and head injury cause Cady to suffer memory blanks from summer fifteen. It doesn’t help that her ‘Liars’ won’t fill her in on anything, having been told it’s best if she tries to remember things on her own. What eventually comes to light regarding the events of summer fifteen will absolutely blow your mind! Though I knew there would be a shock twist, I was in no way prepared for the one they gave me! A relatively short book, I blitzed through it, and highly recommend. ***************************Well fuckRTC
989018611	THAT ENDING.I knew that the ending was going to be a huge twist and I kept trying to come up with different twists in my head while reading, but I didn't even come close to what it really was.I got a little annoyed with Cadence after a while of her complaining, but the character development was wonderful. I couldn't give it 5/5 because I didn't really find myself attached to any of the characters. Still recommend to anyone who would like to read a suspenseful contemporary book and, obviously, I suggest that you go into this book blindly.
989586762	"Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound,then from my eyes,my ears,my mouth." I feel like this book should come with a bright yellow sticker that says, "Warning: Highbrow literature".Because that's what We Were Liars is. A pretentious, overambitious volume that tries to recreate The Great Gatsby, but fails because it wants to rub its importance in its readers' faces.At least The Great Gatsby attempted to fly by as lowbrow. The language is relatively simple and it has a point: to depict the excessive wastefulness of the Roaring Twenties and how the ye olde American Dream is a bunch of shit if you don't have a rich daddy. The purpose of We Are Liars, as far as I can observe, is for literature students to wank over its unique style and analyze every badly-written metaphor and period because it all means something. Why else would passages like these appear? "I see the base of Beechwood Island andMy arms and legs feel numb but my fingers are cold. SlicesOf seaweed go past as I fall." The choppy sentences have no particular impact on the story or character, so it must be a matter of style. And once you start fiddling with style, you venture into the sacred land of Great Authors and literary analysis. Which brings us back to our previous point: ego-stroking.And the metaphors. My lord, the metaphors. "When blood dripped on my bare feet or poured over the book I was reading, he was kind. He wrapped my wrists in soft white gauze and asked me questions about what had happened." That's not a real injury. That's Candace, the main character, describing her sadness. Her dripping, purple sadness.Clean-up on page 42!I suppose I could live with the overblown style and excessive metaphors (I actually enjoyed them up until the 20% mark) if the narrator was somewhat likeable.Is she? Let's find out. "Steamed clams, potatoes, and sweet corn. The staff made it. I didn't know their names." [Gat]: "I'm saying we should talk about it. Not everyone has private islands. Some people work on them. Some work in factories. Some don't have work. Some don't have food." “You’re filled with superiority, aren’t you? You think you understand the world so much better than I do... But you haven’t paid bills, you haven’t had a family, owned property, seen the world. You have no idea what you’re talking about, and yet you do nothing but pass judgment.” Ah, our poor privileged narrator, who never fails to remind us that she's white. Her and her private island, all-expenses paid trips to Europe, and likely inheritor of the vast family fortune. But wait! She's in a Facebook 'It's complicated' relationship with a boy and gets head-splitting migraines, that paint her brain mauve. Woe is her. I lay prone on the bathroom floors of several museums, feeling the cold tile underneath my cheek as my brain liquefied and seeped out my ear, bubbling. Migraines left my blood spreading across unfamiliar hotel sheets, dripping on the floors, oozing into carpets, soaking through leftover croissants and Italian lace cookies.” She gives away things to atone for her 'sins', never giving a shit that her mother might want to hang onto the jeweled frame that contained a photo of her deceased grandmother. Oh no, she's doing good. So much good that she smashes ivory statues that her grandfather bought, instead doing something useful like selling it and donating the money to Greenpeace. She's not repenting; she's a spoiled brat who thinks she's the next Gandhi.Your enjoyment of the book will severely hinge on whether you can put up with Martyr Cadence for 200+ pages. The twist caught me by surprise and I awarded it an extra .5 stars. Otherwise, I dread the day my grandchild brings We Are Liars home to write a 2000-word essay on.May the literature gods have mercy on our lowbrow souls.
2026457989	2.5 I really wanted to love this book. It's the perfect thriller to the beach. Even though I didn't hate it, I can't see myself recommending it. You will either love it or hate it.I loved reading about the family going every summer to their island and spend time together. Everything else ended up falling short for me. I couldn't connect to the writing which ruined the book for me. You could see the ending coming...A quick read for the summer... just wasn't for me!

4080845948	“We are liars. We are beautiful and privileged. We are cracked and broken.” Buddy read with Naomi and Bonnie✨💖Well wellim so confused abt why this book has so much hypelook i often get caught up in the feelings while reading a book. and I often rate books based on that. my first reaction after finishing this book wasOH MY GOD WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAThen i thought and realisedThis book suckslike so hardthis book was boring and boring and boringWe were Liars is the story of rich white privileged kid being whiny about life. Cadence along with her cousins and friends Gat (like that is a name), Merrin and Johny vacation at island every yearthis book lacks plot. except for the MAJOR PLOT TWIST, there is no plotthe entirety of the first half is just sooo boringlike this book is only 273 pgs long and these 273 pgs haven't felt so long. The major part of this book is supposed to be the whole family dynamicbut where is it??every character is just a cardboard cutout of each other -all are rich-all are privileged-all have pRoBlEmS -everyone keeps whiningLIKE GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER ALREADYI spent the entire 273 pgs reading abt Cadence whining about her family.The Liars were supposed to be close af but I don't really see any close relationship. like we spent so much time in Cady's head that we hardly see anyone else and the characters are so under developedJohnny is boringMirren is boringand don't get me started on GatFirst of all, when did Gat become a namesecond, all last names of Indians are not Singh or Patildon't include rep just for the sake of it. GIVE ME DEPTH GIVE ME DEPTH I really really hate Token Diversity. Like Gat Patil is a character with lots of potentials. Indian background, the whole 2 gf thingy you could have created such a strong character with him. He's an outsider and everything abt him is so fun!but nooooh nooohow dare we have a good characterCadence is really stupid and irritating. She's so lucky and privileged. She's bratty. SpoiledAnd cant take a no for an answerShe keeps sayingMy GatMy GatNoo gurl he ain't yours he is a personnnnMe after reading abt their supposed pRoBlEmS The writing is so fucking weirdIn the bookWhy do sentencesrandomly break offHitting the enter key 3 times doesn't make your writing any betterno itdoesnotIm like totally getting why this book seemed so longits bczof theexcessiveuse ofenterkey Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound,then from my eyes,my ears,my mouth. every word is jumbled together and it was so fckng confusingwhat is up with this book?A character just compares another to strong coffeestop with the weird metaphors lmaothe worst thing about this book is that the entire book is about the twist. Like you have to have a plot right? Just bcz u have mind-blowing twist doesn't compensate for the rest of the bookand this plot has tons of potential. The Guest List has the ​same rich people vibe and omg it was executed really well.But this is no just norich peoplecomplainingis not mycomfortreadThis was a really short review I'm so sorrybut i dont have enough brain cells to write a proper reviewWe were Liars?More like We were arsonistsor We were idiotsPeace out🤞🌈|Blog|Pintrest| LinktreeMy rating system:5⭐ - I loved it soo much!

1380797656	First Read: March 2017, Rating: 5/5 starsSecond Read: November 2018, Rating: 5/5 starsThird Read: April 2020, Rating: 5/5 starsFourth Read: December 2023, Rating: 5/5 starsFifth Read: July 2025, Rating: 5/5 srarsYA contemporary and thriller novels are ones I can definitely enjoy but rarely revisit. This one, however, seems to be made with something different. The writing style is somewhat plain and straight forward and many of the characters are so like other unlikable and privileged individuals that I have read about before. The concluding twist and the endless build-up of mysteries, lies, and intrigue throughout keeps me captivated every time, despite intimately knowing every detail of this short book after my fourth reread.I literally do not know what to say about this book except that y'all need to go read it, sob like a baby, and experience the biggest plot twist of your life!
2501433502	Be normal.Because you are.Because you can be I am so, so glad I decided to pick this up. It was amazing. I am going to do my best to review this without spoilers. Here it goes. The beginning is not very interesting. Unfortunately, I've seen this fact drive away a ton of readers. This is why I suggest the audio. Just keep listening, it ends amazingly. It definitely took me a while to get used the storytelling style that is so unique to E. Lockhart. The ending was amazing. It was like nothing I was imagining. I can't even give vague hints though without ruining the entire story. Aside from the mystery, I really enjoyed the family aspect of this book evening they were the definition of "dysfunctional".Bottom Line:5 Solid Stars: A great story with a plot twist like no other.Age Recommendation: 13+TW: Injuries, Substance Abuse| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram
831171793	I'm pretty disappointed in this one. To me, it was very predictable and underwhelming. However, I did really like atmosphere of the story, the characters, and the writing. Listening to it as an audiobook definitely enhanced the experience.
7521854507	genuinely the stupidest book ever written
791732342	We Were Liars is an incredible, heartbreaking read that really messes with your mind until the very end. The writing, while not for everyone I'm sure, had me mesmerized. It's so different and poetic and full of carefully crafted imagery. It's a writing style that's really out of the box, you'll either love it or hate it. Me, I was thoroughly compelled. The plot itself is one you can't talk about or read about as you're bound to find out spoilers. It's the kind of story where the story itself is a spoiler from very early on. There are hints floating in every corner, pieces of this carefully constructed puzzle laid out for you to put together. My advice: go into this with zero expectations and you might find yourself as enthralled as I was! Although it's a twist I have seen before in different variations (and thus I wasn't completely caught off guard by the ending), it never fails to give me goosebumps and sting at my poor heart. The cast is large, and the dark, twisted fairy-tale-like quality is ever-present inside this tale revolving around greed, power, and material things. This tone is maintained with actual short fairy-tale retellings scattered throughout that bore an eerie resemblance to the present story. It did take me a bit to get all the characters and different disaccords in order - the cryptic, mind-boggly nature of this plot and writing makes it hard to make sense of what's being conveyed at times, but this is clearly purposeful and I ended up impressed by its cleverness. But anyways, this review has to stay short because, la la la - no spoilers - it's that kind of read. Plus the blurb told me to lie, so maybe this review is full of crock and this book is just a bunch of dancing elephants. In any case - 4 stars all the way!--An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads
1244609767	“What if we could stop being different colors, different backgrounds, and just be in love?”I hard quite a hard time rating this book.Things I LovedThe title, the unreliable narrator, the wonderful writing style, the air of mystery, the unexpected twists and turns, the priviliged-wealthy-private-island setting, the fairytales.Things I Did Not LoveThe many names and characters. Ugh, it took me a while to figure out who was who inspite of the family tree! The self-centered protagonist, the shallow side-characters, the oh so forgiving family (sorry but that seems absolutely unrealistic to me), the fact that (view spoiler)[ the Liars were ghosts from beginning to end, the low melodrama ("Gat, my Gat" slowly got on my nerves. And he himself dead or not was kind of melodramatic too) (hide spoiler)], the fairytales.But somehow inspite of all the negative aspects mentioned above I just really loved We Were Liars. Absoluetly compelling and intruiging, it just has...something!Find more of my books on Instagram
3788842417	“Do not accept an evil you can change.” OHMYGOD THAT ENDING , the way this whole story makes sense now. the way i aprriciate this book somuch after finishing it. All i feel like doing right now for the rest of my life is scream intoo the void. This is a book that while you are reading you dont realize what kinda masterpiece it is. Then you look back on it and its so freaking damn brilliant. i will never get over this book. krizzie will forever be shocked and d e s e a c e d. again yes. 4.25 Starss - spoiler free revieuw , spoilers can be found at the bottom off my revieuw. Special mention too Lacey aka the queen of recs. discussing our screaming intoo the void session was everything i needed after finishing this book aaah. Okay so first off all i wont summarize the plot of this and i cant really tell you guys what makes this book so good because those things i cant say without spoiling things. The thing about this book is you really just need too pick it up and believe me it is worth it in my opinion at least. This is a book that ends in this kinda way that totally changes the book arround and in my opinion made it somuch better. When i readed the ending i suddenly saw all the brilliant and just very brilliant clues this book gave trough the story of the main charracter. everything fits together and its just brilliant because of the way this book ends. When i was reading this at first i felt like this would be like a 3 star rating book. This because the writing is sometimes too much for my taste too like with sometimes too much Methaphors like this sentence : “He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.” thats also the reason this doesnt have 5 stars because of these sometimes weird Methaphors i didnt like and the writing was sometimes too much of that. but during my read i kept wondering about what was going on and the book did keep my on the edge of my seat and then the ending comes and the whole book comes together and i am shocked. I will be shocked for the rest of my life. i already feel like rereading this too see all the clues the minute i finished. The way this book deals with Trauma and the rep of trauma in its ugly way it just. i cant. this is so important and you can really see especially after you finished this book how much research the author did too make this rep the way it is. Truly this trauma rep is in my opinion really good and really makes you thinking about it a long while after you finished this book in my opinion. The way that rep is handeled in the book and the way the ending makes this whole story come together and you realize how brilliant this book is are the best things about this book. I would definitly suggest even if you struggle a bit in the first bit of this book too keep reading because its truly worht it krizzie promises : D Anyway sorry this doesnt have like a summarize in it but this is just a book you have too experience for yourself. The ending , the way this whole book comes together and once you realize everything , the trauma rep. those parts are just pure gold and brilliant. The writing was sometimes a bit too much for me with a lot of Methaphors but i feel like i could overlook it in the end because of the rest of the story. Just read this and give it a shot and see what you think of it because its truly something else and a story that really made an inpact on me already. And I am still thinking about it the ending definitly made this story what it is for me and the trauma rep that is amazingly done. i do still am not a fan of the writing and found it very dumb and weird a lot of the times and if it wherent for this ending and my feelings towards this story as a whole then i woudnt like it but damn that ending and the story as a whole and the trama rep is just good. But yeah the writing is still not my thing and super weird at times with all the weird methaphors so be aware before you go in. spoiler section (view spoiler)[Okay so honestly this ending. I didnt guess this at all. i felt the entire book like there was something not right but i thought more of maybe Cady died herself but no they all died.So everything caty experienced , she all saw them but they where not real. Cady coudnt cope with what happend and her brain shut every memorry down in a way too survive , this is real and a real state of trama. its a way of your brain too make you being able too deal with it when you are ready for it and this rep is truly just ugh. this is a true emotional story and just the way everything comes together damn. also think about all the clues they are fucking brilliant. it all makes sense now The fact that the liars where never at the main lunches and dinners when the whole family where there , why they where only Cuddletown , why htey never replied too her emails because they coudnt because they where not there anymore , the way Cady was the same height as gat despite him being a grown boy ,Johhny his mother wearing his coat and crying in midnight because he is death like oh my god. i am just shocked. like how the author created this all. damn. thats some great work. you cant deny that. even tho i am not a fan of the writing this ending and the way everything makes sense is brilliant (hide spoiler)]
8065837825	Why are 15 year olds yapping about bringing down the patriarchy?? fft stfu and go do your homework I don't have time for this nonsense.
4173501135	I loved the plot twist at the end. It really surprised me and shed the entire book in a whole new light. However, I didn't really bond with the authors writing style or the characters. Because of that, in the beginning I kind of felt like I was just reading in order to get to the end and figure out the twist. So if I could, I would give the beginning/middle 2.5 stars and the end 4 stars.
887925005	Warning to everyone who reads We Were Liars: Be prepared to scrape your chin off the floor. With a forklift. Yes, it really is that amazing.
4151708175	Buddy read with Aashi, Zeal, Fran and Jenna. 💕Alternate Title for this book: We Were Liars with #Whitegirlproblems and #Richpeopleproblems~I don’t consider trigger warnings as spoilers, but if you do then don’t read them~ Trigger Warnings: Memory loss, Self-harm, Suicidal ideation, Migraines, Near-drowning incident, Death, Arson, Racism, Head InjuryI don’t like giving disclaimers in my reviews because we are all entitled to our own opinions and if you loved this book, I’m happy for you! I’m just saying if I sound like I want to murder this book in this review (That’s probably because I want to), just know that I never meant to offend you.~This review is not in my usual format because I’m fucking tired of this book~I WANT TO CANCEL BOOKTOK🔪🔪🔪. I most definitely read this due to the huge wave of hype that was caused by booktok and it was like I would drown if I didn’t read this book and bitch I wish I had drowned (maybe I shouldn’t mention drowning in this situation iykyk) because after reading this I’m confused as hell. My brain cells are dead…Let’s first talk about what I liked. I loved the short chapters, look I’m trash for short chapters and I absolutely despise long chapters so that was good!The writing was engaging, was it dramatic Oh, hell yes but I liked it, it kept me intrigued.That’s where the good things end.Let’s talk about the plot for a minute….Yup, that’s it because I’m still finding the fucking plot. Halfway through, I forgot about the plot tbh. But I don’t usually care about the plot if I love the characters (I liked neither lol) but not when it’s a mystery, I NEED A PLOT WHEN I’M READING A MYSTERY/THRILLER BOOK!!! Yes, I need good characters but I also need a good plot. The plot got bent, twisted, and halfway through it got blended.The plot halfway through:The plot was original of how our main character Cadence (Cady) got to the hospital due to a severe accident that she had no idea about… And from the blurb, the family already sounded fucked up, flawed and broken. I mean look at this line"WELCOME TO THE beautiful Sinclair family.No one is a criminal.No one is an addict.No one is a failure."This was an amazing opening line and because of this I thought we’ll get flawed characters with depth and a beautiful, strong plot to keep things moving. Let me tell you, I was wrong as hell… The title “We Were Liars” is so misleading, it never gave answers to why they were called liars but rather I had a question, “Did they ever really lie in their lives or maybe the title itself was the lie?” The characters were some of the most bland, vanilla characters I’ve ever read. I was shocked that how could these characters be so boring. And don’t get me wrong, I love flawed/morally grey characters but don’t tell me these characters were interesting. The characters in a nutshell:Cady was so annoying. I did kinda feel bad for her. But the book was just her complaining (Kinda like me just complaining in this review but we’re not going to discuss that) So she essentially felt bad for being rich and did I mention she was fucking annoying yet?? Because she was.And not to mention she was dramatic as fuckJust look at thisThen he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound,then from my eyes,my ears,my mouthAfter reading I was like fuck, her father shot her but no she was just being her ~dear old dramatic self~ So after coming to terms with Cady being dramatic when it was mentioned she was bleeding all over Gat, I was like so is this dramatic too *visible confusion* But know it wasn’t because Gat was fucking damaging her wounds.Now Gat was the only sensible character in this book. He is Indian-American. He actually talked about real shit and called Cady out for her ~feeling sorry for being rich~ ☺🔪I first thought he was an asshole at the beginning and he was you know he cheated on his already present girlfriend with Cady (I DO NOT TOLERATE CHEATING) but overall he was fine.I liked Mirren and Johnny were alright I guess, they weren’t talked about much in the book.Not to mention the mom and Grandad were complete fucking idiots see parents if you want to have kids CARE ABOUT THEM. The mom makes Cady not grieve because she “can be normal” and I’m like ma’am, she’s not normal now.And the grandad GET THAT RACIST PIECE OF TRASH OUT OF HERE. Just because you are grieving doesn’t mean you can treat your own children and grandchildren as absolute trash.Spoilers begin, so if you still want to read this godforsaken book this is where we part waysThe plot twist, oh the fucking plot twist, this is gonna be WILD.So now here’s the thing the plot twist it was fucking confusing. SO THEY WERE ALL DEAD ALL ALONG????!!!!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. So then I thought ok so this book is satire, she was hanging around with ghosts. But once I cleared my head and thought about it, it was actually Cady’s hallucinations that were making them assholes. WHY DID CADY MAKE HER HALLUCINATIONS OF THE LIARS MAKE THEM HATE HER.So she made up these hallucinations of Gat being an asshole to her But then again it was her hallucination so she made her hallucination to ask her that we should start over. I JUST DON’T GET IT. Also how tf does she kiss her own hallucination!!!So she just burns the place down and because she knows the others die she just goes and submerges herself in the sea, and THAT MY FRIENDS WAS THAT MOMENT WHEN EVERYONE CRIED. And I’m just like you kidding right how is that supposed to make me cry????THINKING ABOUT THAT PLOT TWIST CONFUSES THE SHIT OUT OF ME. I talked with my friend Aashi later when we completed the book that WTF was that plot twist and sufficed to say we were both confused.And the Ending is supposed to make me cry. bitch what? To make me cry, I actually need to connect with the characters and I hated the characters so…Me when someone says they cried at the ending:PLEASE TELL ME HOW PEOPLE CAN LIKE THIS BOOK???THIS WAS A BELOW THAN AVERAGE BORING-ASS THRILLER WHICH WASN’T THRILLING AT ALL.DON’T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME READING THIS PIECE OF TRASHFinal ThoughtsBURN IN HELL BOOKTOKMe after I read the book:That's my review!

2921213691	Propaganda is a monologue that is not looking for an answer, but an echo." —W. H. AudenI feel duped.This overhyped book was advertised thus: "A literary read ... dark and gripping ... a shocking twist ending!"To amuse myself, I was going to type my review in the truncated style in which the book was written (at times it more resembled an eye chart than a piece of literature), but Mark Monday has beaten me to the punch. : (Mark Monday's reviewI was expecting a literary tour de force: a book that would have me purring over its erudite prose as it dragged me into its diabolical depths. Alas, it was as thrilling as last year's Penguin-Counting Competition in Antartica. And as for the 'shock twist', (view spoiler)[I assumed 'something' to be the case early on - and anticipated a far juicier twist to come. Alas, the 'thing' that I'd already taken for granted WAS the twist! (hide spoiler)] *sigh*I shall say no more.
3816792599	This is one of those books that I tell everyone they need to read. It feels like you're living in the book with the main character, Cadence, who is trying to figure out her own dark secrets that she can't remember. If you read this, buckle up because you're in for a shocking roller coaster of hard-hitting emotions. The reason I give this 4 stars (and I'm really wishing GoodRead would allow half stars for a 4.5) is because I found it a bit difficult to follow the plot for the first 100 pages or so. There's many characters to get to know and I kept getting them mixed up. After getting used to the setting and characters, I flew through the book. If you have this issue while reading, keep going! Once you catch onto everything, you won't be able to stop reading.
4070616345	** spoiler alert ** Let me start this review by saying that though I hated most of the characters, the plot was very intriguing- atleast for me. I don't read a lot of books from the mystery and thriller genre maybe that's why I loved the ending. I seriously couldn't predict whatever was going to happen at the end. Tbh this book reminded me a lot of The Cousins by Karen M. MacManus. So if by any chance you liked this book, you could try reading the Cousins. “We are liars. We are beautiful and privileged. We are cracked and broken.” In this book we have Cadence, a 17 year old girl who has lost every memory of her time spent at her grandparents island when she was 15 due to some accident. She don't even remember what happened to her. Her cousins and Gat (her boyfriend?), the so called Liars, don't respond to her texts, her mother never tell her whatever happened to her. So we see Cadence going back to the private island owned by her grandfather to find out whatever happened to her and the Liars and the cause of the accident. “I suffer migraines. I do not suffer fools.”OK so don't shoot me when I say that I liked Cadence. A lot of my friends did not like the way this book was written in (I.e. indirectly Cadence's train of thoughts). But I really liked it.She was the only one who tried to see her messed up family from Gat's point of view. The only thing I didn't like about her was the way she reacted when the accident was mentioned. Like I get it that you were going through a lot but there's no need to be rude to others.“Always do what you're afraid to do.”I wish Harris died when everyone who died died (does this even make sense?). He was a fucking racist bigot. He didn't like Gat just because he was part Indian. Like wtf old man. He really thought that Ed (his daughter Carrie's boyfriend) was way below his level because he wasn't white. Go and rot in hell. And his relationship with his daughters was fucked up too. Talk about his daughters though. Huh! They-1. were dependent on their dumbass father. 2. did not give a fuck about their children. All they wanted was money. 3. were greedy and jealous bitches who not only messed up their lives but also their children's life too.“Someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments. I get the same thing spending an hour with you.”Gat was the second and last character I loved in this book. And he was the first ever person who wasn’t born in India but loved to visit there. I don't know why authors make India sound so disgusting in books. Like one time I read this book where this girl told her friends about her trip to India (and how disgusted she was) and how she had to take mosquito repellent. India is a very beautiful country if you ignore some racist,sexist homophobic assholes living in our country. But guess what? These type of people exist everywhere, like every single country I know of. Just because India's population is way too much doesn't mean it's bad. I went off topic once again but whatever..This needed to be said. So yeah Gat was one of the best character in this book. He was the only one who saw behind the horrible truths of the Sinclairs.“What if we could stop being different colors, different backgrounds, and just be in love?”I hate Cadence's mother Penny for being a bad mother to Cadence. I hate Cadence's aunt Carrie. She rejected Ed's proposal just because she won't get her father's inheritance. If you reject someone with whom you are with for a long time for money then you are not worth it. You know what? I really feel that the entire reason for this book's existence is Carrie's rejection. Why? Well because:Carrie's rejection = Liar's stupid plan = No fire = No tragedy = No accident = No memory loss = No book.Therefore if you hated this book then don't blame E. Lockhart. Blame Aunt Carrie for it.

1032334208	That ending, W O W.I spent the entirety of the book formulating all possible endings but nothing I came up with was even close. Praise to the author for how well this was all strung together!! The story line and the writing style was unbelievably rich. This was just such a fantastic story line I can't express this enough. I would give this a 4.5 stars. It is sooo much better going into this blindly. The absolute best way to read this. DO NOT SPOIL IT FOR YOURSELF BY SKIMMING!!
2062359158	Here's the thing about books.They're filled with a profusion of words, phrases, sentences, fragments, messages, stories. They beg you to talk about them and carry them on once the epilogue hits and you're on the last word. Once you close the book, they silently ask you to go and talk about what it was about... because that's what words do. They demand to be spoken. But every so often, You come across one.And it leaves you speechless.
759921589	Not just one of the best YA books I've read this year, but one of the best books I read this year in any genre. E. Lockhart has written a novel that is both literary and commercial. It will grab readers of YA, of course, but is also the perfect book to hand to those naysayers who wonder why adults read YA. I can't say enough about this book -- I want to simultaneously hug it and keep it for myself and hand it to everyone I know.Please go into this as "blind" as you can -- don't let anyone spoil it for you. The less you know about the story, the more you will be affected. That being said, even though I've just finished it, I want to go back and re-read it right away.(Read the Advanced Reading Copy; this will be published in May 2014).
7846327334	New Yorker Gat Patil first joined Cadence, Jonny and Mirren on Beechwood (rich, powerful, all blond and beautiful family's island) in Summer 8 after the death of his father. He became best friends with eight year-old Cadence when showed him immediate warmth empathy. The kids' antics and lies saw them called 'The Liars'. In Summer 17, 17 year old Cadence is struggling with her Beechwood friendships post a traumatic Summer 15 when she fell in romantic love with Gat and also had a serious brain injury, an injury that prevents her remembering much about Summer 15. In Summer 17 the next time she's allowed back to Beechwood she pesters The Liars and other family members for the truth, and slowly but surely she begins to recall Summer 15.A clever piece of young adult writing that with so much mystery built around Summer 15, being so captivating because in the book we know most of the consequences of Summer 15 but few of the causes. The book reads well, but could have very much done with more and deeper characterisations of Jonny and Mirren. Overall the the slow burn reveal of what happened over Summer 1 5 ids what makes the 'I saw it on Tik-Tok' and 'Netflix adaptation' book work so well. Also definitely in a mature and responsible way for the young adult audience. Hmmm, a Four Star, 8 out of 12 from me, which is a surprise as I originally thought I'd give it a 6; this is why I rarely review a book until a week has past from me finishing it, so I can better judge its impact on me. :)

2153896980	Re-reading a novel you liked is always tricky: you can end up loving it more or in the same way, or find out that it was always pretty bad. If we overlook the endless descriptions of food, clothes, furniture and counting; if we overlook the childish narration - she's seventeen, after all; and if we overlook the annoying feeling of everyone being mad at Cady for no explainable reason - what’s the point of being mad at someone who tries to remember what happened btw?Then what remains is the plot twist, THAT plot twist, and I remember why I liked it in the first place.↠ 3 stars

Then, I saw the foreshadows throughout the book and realized the plot twist wasn’t something you would never expect but I guess I was subconsciously denying that it could end this way. God, the emotional damage... It hurts too much. Another reason for my rating is that I’m not sure I liked the writing style. I somehow couldn’t get into it. However, overall, it was a nice read and I will probably read the prequel because I’m curious. 👀༉‧₊˚. « What if we could somehow stop being the beautiful Sinclair family and just be a family?

This just wasn’t for me.And I don’t mean to offend anyone who enjoy it.There is no way to say this in a nice way, so here we go, this book was boring and forgetful. It irritated me from start to finish. I don’t see the point of this book, seriously 😒. I think this is my first or second 1 star ⭐️ review.I heard so many GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT, mostly on booktube, and I was so excited to start reading this and being blown away butAnd the characters are just dull and uninteresting. The narrator just annoyed me and just NO to everything.
982477516	What happened that Summer? Why Can't she remember? Why won't anyone tell her what happened?We Were Liars is a modern young adult suspense novel from National Book Award finalist and Printz Award honoree E. Lockhart. It was nominated by readers on Gooodreads as the best Young Adult Fiction book of 2014. It is also listed on NPR's Concierge best books of 2014 list.We Were Liars turned out to be a very fast read. It is a well written Young Adult novel with a mysterious tragedy. When I first started reading the book, I thought the Cadence, the narrator of the book, was mentally ill and everything was a figment of her imagination. She had been found curled up on the beach, bruised, and distraught. She spends the next few month recovering in the hospital and can’t remember anything. To add to her frustration, no one including her Mother and Doctors won’t tell her what happened to her. As she returns to Beechwood Island, a couple of summers later, she tries to piece together what no one in her family will talk about. As the story unfolds, the reader is given glimpses into the summer when the "Liars", consisting of Johnny, Gat, Mirren, and Cadence, are 15 years old. They come to a private island, Beechwood Island, off Martha’s Vineyard each year off the coast of Massachusetts with their families. Three of the teenagers (Johnny, Mirren, and Cadence) are privileged members of the prestigious Sinclair family; however, Gat is not a member of the spoiled Sinclair family, but a visiting friend. The teenagers form a close bond and spend all of their free time together. Then something tragic happens. Something that Cadence can't remember. Something that affects not only her but her entire family. I really enjoyed this book. It is about social class, love (family love and first love), loss, tragedy and friendship, I liked how it was told from the point of view of Cadence. The reader learns of events as Cadence is finally able to recall them. A very fast read.* oh I also liked the stories/tales/fairy tales that Cadence wrote. Several of them had a mouse in them - one marries a mouse, one gives birth to a mouse, etc. I found this interesting. But all of the stories had tragedy. I thought this was a nice touch in the book.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com
7785163339	Oh I did not see that coming. There is just something so addictive and captivating about reading about rich people doing terrible rich people things. This book is full of unlikeable characters that are hard to relate to, but I couldn’t help but feel invested in their outcome. The writing in this book was eerie. Emotions were written out as violent acts. It had an almost poetic rhythm. Didn’t expect to love this one as much as I did!

Review:Let me just begin with saying that this is the best book I’ve read so far this year.This book reminded me of all the summers I spent with my cousins.It reminded me of the beach.It reminded me of Granma and Grandpa may they both rest in peace.This book reminded me of true love.And all the sacrifices that come with it.It reminded me of all the times I was fearless enough to say no,And all the times I was fearless enough not to take no as an answer.This book is about, lies but also truth.It’s about life and death.It’s about grief and guilt.It’s about forgetting but also remembering.We were liars, but what if we were not?
820258471	3.5We are Sinclairs. Beautiful. Privileged. Damaged. Liars. We live, in the summertime on a private island off the coast of Massachusetts. And perhaps that is all you need to know.[image error]I am always looking for King Lear-ish story lines (I loved King Lear)- and for the most part- this fits the bill. I wish- WE WERE LIARS had focused more on the three mother's story lines...but then this wouldn't have been YA, I suppose. I also think it would have been better without a twist ending (Oh how many times must I say that?) You all probably know what it is by now... but don't worry I won't give it away...just in case.[image error]Young, beautiful, blond, rich and living on a private island...sounds so horrible doesn't it?

BAD DECISION 😭 I should’ve trusted my gut.😔Was it interesting? ABSOLUTELY NOT 😭The plot? Confusing asf 💀(And if the author meant for it to be all mysterious to keep us hooked—sorry, but it didn’t work on me 😑)Ughhh-I’m exhausted. Literally. This book drained me so much I don’t even have the energy to rant properly 😭(view spoiler)[And okay, here’s my half-baked theory: So the book’s called We WERE Liars, right? And the FMC has amnesia?? So I’m guessing the Liars are just imaginary, or maybe something tragic happened in Summer Fifteen?? 👀 OH—and she remembers that they started the fire sooo… idk, maybe they didn’t make it out??? 😬 That’s my best guess.

6661194475	Before I started reading We Were Liars, I thought it would simply be a story about a family and a child bravely facing adversity. I expected a thrilling journey, but the ending was completely unexpected.The Sinclair family seemed perfect. No one had ever committed a crime, done drugs, failed, or been impoverished. They always maintained an optimistic outlook, undeterred by any misfortune.During Cadence's 15th summer, her father abandoned her and her mother. That summer, Cadence and her mother went to their annual retreat on Beechwood Island, a private island where Cadence spent time with her friends Johnny, Mirren, and the boy she loved, Gat. They were known as the "Liars" by the family. Every summer since they were 8, they had spent time on this island. The Sinclair family was wealthy, and they had built 3 houses on the steep, private island. Cadence's grandfather had 3 beautiful daughters, and as expected, there was the usual family strife over property and land.That 15th summer, Cadence's beloved Gat found a girlfriend in New York. And during that same summer, Cadence selectively forgot the terrifying events that occurred on the island. Although she tried to recover these lost memories, I think she probably regretted searching for them. At 15th, such a beautiful age, life should be simple, happy, and carefree. But when they saw the adults fighting over family property and their grandfather, they chose to do something terrifying to keep the family together.A terrible fire broke out. While people mourned the deaths of Mirren, Johnny, and Cadence's beloved Gat, Cadence was unable to attend the funeral due to illness.Cadence continued to text Mirren and leave her voicemails; she kept calling Johnny until his voicemail box was full; she sent them emails... because she had forgotten that summer and that they were no longer alive. Cadence existed in another time and space, a time where Mirren, Johnny, and Gat were still alive. It wasn't until she regained her memory that she realized the incident, which had ended long ago, was truly over.It’s a cruel irony that a conflict between adults inflicted such immense pain on innocent children. The idyllic image of carefree youth was shattered, replaced by a nightmare. How could such beauty be tainted by such darkness?It was only when I reached the cruelest ending that I truly understood everything E Lockhart had described. Lockhart’s narrative style was clever and poignant. The flashbacks and flash-forwards created a rollercoaster of emotions, shifting between sweetness, mystery, and immense sadness. It kept me hooked and gave me a new appreciation for his work.Cadence was the only one left alive. She had to live the rest of her life without the “Liars” It was a cruel reality. The living were the ones who suffered the most, tormented by their hearts. At just 17th, Cadence had to endure this pain until the end of her life.If only things could be different.4.2 / 5 stars
2700712405	Unlike her other book that I read it this month, Genuine Fraud, this one, a very good part of it, for me, was a slow paced one. At one point was so slow and seemed without any plot, that for a second crossed my mind to DNF it. But I don't usually DNF books, and to be honest, besides the light and not that usual style of writing specifically for E. Lockhart, something else made me not to do it. So I didn't DNF it. It was something pushing me to give it a chance, to see what the finish might give me and if it will surprise me in any way.And let me tell you, the finish almost broke my heart! I didn't saw that coming. Not even for one second. Maybe because I consider myself a newbie in mystery, but I. DID. NOT. SAW. THAT. COMING!The ending, compared with sometimes very confusing writing, made me almost drop my phone. Gave me goosebumps, and an urge to start crying, because the pain of realization felt so very real! Like I was there, and all those things happened to me.I won't continue to talk more about the writing, about characters and so on, because there are a ton of reviews, good and bad opinions, and I don't want to risk to repeat what many other reviewers said about this book before me.So I will let you just with this "advice" if I can call it like that. Even if you are not a fan of slow writing, or you are new to the mystery genre and don't know what to start with, or the writing might get on your nerves sometimes, please give it a try. It might surprise you in a very good way, exactly how it did with me.

3918303505	okay i know i’m not the target audience for this book but it was AWFUL. in. every. aspect.the plot was mediocre and only showed how spoiled and basic the ‘liars’ are, they had no personality whatsoever, the whole premise was really shallow, it didn’t make you wonder what as going to happen next and it simply wasn’t interesting. also, how stupid was that plot twist?? maybe if i was in middle school i would’ve enjoyed it.the writing might be the worst part tho.what was this?i meanit felt like a 13 yo wrote it.attempted poetry?just plain annoying.and badsimply bad.edit: i just found out this was also advertised as a psychological thriller? that’s just insulting.

I want you to believe me when I say THIS IS A BOOK YOU NEED TO READ. Everyone. I don’t care what you read. So please hear me when I say this: this book is beyond amazing, it blew me away and it is one of the BEST BOOKS I’ve read in a long time. This book deserves more than 5 stars -- it deserves fireworks and confetti and lots of recognition. I haven’t had a book really wreck me like this one did but I sobbed and I screamed and this is why I love reading…BOOKS LIKE THIS. A truly remarkable story from start to finish. Especially the finish. It’s just brilliant and my words are just paltry little things that can’t do it any justice.It's rare that I read a book THIS early but I will carry the torch for this book right up until it is released and beyond.Read the rest of my thoughts on my blog

I will not be writing a review since majority of my thoughts are still the same, sooo yeah! ✧༝┉˚*❋ ❋*˚┉༝✧ ✧༝┉˚*❋ ❋*˚┉༝✧ ✧༝┉˚*❋ ❋*˚┉༝✧3⭐️ - “This island is ours. Here, in some way, we are young forever.” i’m speechless. what. did. i. just. read. the ending was definitely something. i still think about it 8 months later 👍let’s talk a bit about the characters: - Cadence: i’m shocked at how much this character went through, like at one second she seems “fine” but the other second she is like on the verge of death? damn i felt bad. but the thing that confused me the most was the last few chapters like, was she hallucinating or was it like a ghost? ( i won’t speak much so i don’t spoil). but i was mostly confused and a bit annoyed at her obsession with Gat, like yeah i get it you’re in love but honey, chill. anyways, i loved her a lot and i felt really bad for her and i wish she would have at least had a break but the ending kinda made up for it? (not really 😭) “It is good to be loved, even though it will not last.” - Mirren: an angel. i loved her so much, but she did not deserve that. at. all. she’s so sweet bro like????? goshhhh i need someone to text me and let me rant about this book, but one thing that annoyed me was when she lied, like yeah i get it some of us would like to “experience” that hun, but like there is no need to lie about it… but omg the ending with her bikini that said “The Vineyard Is for Lovers” LOVED IT, now i want one 💔. anywho, i loved her a lot, but she could have been a bit kinder 🤷‍♀️. - Johnny: my man. PFFT, my first thought when i saw the name johnny was like, “ johnny kavanagha is that you?” <- and i didn’t even read the books yet- but bro omg i loved his character so much. yeah he can be an ass sometimes but he was such an amazing person, i need someone like him in my life. i love you johnny 😭 - Gat: …….HE READS BOOKS YALL!!!! LETS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT!!!!!! i was so happy when i figured out that he reads books like omg. he is an amazing guy, to say the least but he could have been a bit more open about his feelings toward cady (cadence) because yeah that accident kinda ruined it for her but it would have been better between them if he opened up a bit. but to say the least he’s an amazing guy, and it was nice that the author included a guy of color in the book. “I GUESS THAT is why they’ve been here, I needed them.” the liars are definitely something, really, they are like that group of friends that you always wanted, but it’s hard to have, and losing them means losing everything you ever had. and that was what i was experiencing here, i wish i had a friendship like theirs 💔.again, the plot twists were amazing, and i loved them all so much because it kept me thinking of how that was possible. but there was one scene were i was so confused that now thinking about it the answer should have been clearer then😭 “My Liars, my darlings”
2745705468	2.5 stars“Here I am frozen, when I deserve to burn.”This book was annoying. Seriously, it was so annoying. I didn’t care about any of the characters. The main character was SO annoying. I couldn’t stand her. It just felt that no matter what happens or what’s going on she would only concentrate on herself and her stupid crush over a boy. It was so annoying. The first 80% percent of this book was just plain boring. The only reason I kept on reading is because I was told that the end is so freakin awesome and mind blowing. But you know what? I was so unimpressed. Yes, the ending was sad. Yes, I kinda felt sorry for them. But that’s it. I think those little stories were the only enjoyable thing in this book tho.Also, Why were they called the liars?!! It just still doesn’t make any sense to me.We are liars. We are beautiful and privileged. We are cracked and broken.
