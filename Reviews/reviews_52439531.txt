3915998393	I hate this book, I really hate it. I tried my best not to hate it but just couldnt do anything but hate it. Without further ado, here is my review rant.Question 1: How did you find the characters?A) Love (1 star)B) Like (0.75 stars)C) Okay (0.50 stars)D) Dislike (0.25 stars)E) Hate (0 stars)Explain your answer:The characters were teetering back and forth off of the cliff I call “tolerable” and into the chasm I call “annoying.” I had no love at all for any of the characters. I have no desire to go fight over the characters. They could all go fall in a hole and die, and I couldn’t care less. So now, to begin…Avery: Level of annoyingness: 7.5/10 Avery is the teen who Tobias Hawthorn chose to inherit just about everything he had owned. (BILLIONS of dollars) She’s really annoying and I didn’t really see any personality in her. *shrug* Would I want to be her? Probably. Jameson: Level of annoyingness: 10/10 Brother numero dos or tres. I honestly forgot at this point. He’s the rebellious brother who’s really annoying. 10 reasons why I find him annoying to support my 10/10 annoying meter rating:1. Promptly goes to call Avery Mystery Girl2. Because Avery didn’t like him calling her Mystery Girl, changes it to M.G. which stands for Mystery Girl.3. Changes to calling her Heiress (which, mind you, she also didn’t like) because SHE DIDN’T LIKE THE FIRST TWO.4. Sneaks into her room like a creepy stalker using a secret passage. Creepy x100.5. Sprouts random nonsense that takes you too long to understand "Everyone is going to want something from you soon, Heiress. The question is: How many of us want something you’re willing to give?”6. More random nonsense: "If I do what I should no more often than I say what I shouldn’t - then what does that make me?”7. [insert more random nonsense here]8. A few more things for the last three, but they’re spoilers so let’s leave it at this.Grayson: Level of annoyingness 8/10 Grayson is also either brother numero dos or tres. He doesn’t really do much throughout the entire book. He’s just… kinda there? Still, he was annoying. He was annoying at the beginning and got even more annoying as the book progressed.Xander: Level of annoyingness: 5/10 Brother numero cuatro. The youngest brother. I surprisingly didn’t find him as annoying as everyone else. *sigh of relief* I actually don’t remember half the things he did. Which might be the reason I find him less annoying. But Nash: Level of annoyingness: 8/10 Brother numero uno. The oldest one. He has this aura about him that makes you want to cringe and die inside. and not in a melt-your-heart kind of good way. Just, eww. (I legit thought his name was Nate until 5 minutes ago)Max: Level of annoyingness: 100000000/10 AND… DRUMROLL PLEASEEEE… THE MOST ANNOYING CHARACTER AWARD GOES TO MAX!!! [says sarcastically] CONGRATULATIONS!!! Here, I’m gonna put a few quotes that should explain it all: ”Are you foxing with me, beach?” ”Bull fox-faxing ship” ”What the everlasting mothing-foxing elf is going on here?” And the best worst one: ”THAT FAXING CHIPHEAD CAN GO STRAIGHT TO ELF AND EAT A BAG OF DUCKS!!!” Yes. THREE exclamation marks.Do I ship?Avery x Jameson? No. I couldn’t care lessAvery x Grayson? No. I also couldn’t care lessAvery x Xander? Why am I even putting this here? No.Avery x Nash? Also, why am I even putting this here? No.Avery x no one? The best option out of all of them. *points to screen* THIS ONE!---------------------------Question 2: How did you find the plot?A) Love (1 star)B) Like (0.75 stars)C) Okay (0.50 stars)D) Dislike (0.25 stars)E) Hate (0 stars)Explain your answer:I had no idea what the plot was going into this book. Then when I began reading the book, I was like “wait- is there even a plot?” So confused. Then I eventually got around to reading the blurb thingy, and I was like [say in extremely dull tone] “oh.” I judged this book by the title, and I was expecting the characters to have to play a riddle and puzzle game to win the inheritance Tobias Hawthorn left behind. Which definitely would have been more interesting than *waves hands around in the air* whatever this was.The plot follows Avery, a poor teen living in her car, who becomes the world’s youngest billionaire when Tobias Hawthorn leaves almost all of his inheritance to her. But, there’s a catch. Avery has to live in Hawthorn House, which is filled with secret passages and riddles, for at least one year, or else all of the money would be sent to charity. Naturally, the deceased Hawthorn guy’s family is… to put it mildly, jealous of her. To put it as it is, they’re feeling murderous. Now, Avery has to survive in the house for a year. Yes, I said survive. Because there’s danger waiting at every turn, yadda yadda. *rolls eyes in boring*---------------------------Question 3: How did you find the setting/worldbuilding?A) Love (1 star)B) Like (0.75 stars)C) Okay (0.50 stars)D) Dislike (0.25 stars)E) Hate (0 stars)Explain your answer:The setting of this book takes place mostly in Hawthorn House. The secret passages and riddles that are hidden all over the house were kind of cool. But, I feel that it could have been explored further. We get to see… what? 3 secret passages the entire book? 2? And a map of the house would have been really nice. I felt like I had no idea where anything was in the supposedly huge house that the grandfather “added a new room or wing every year.” ---------------------------Question 4: How did you find the writing/POV/pacing?A) Love (1 star)B) Like (0.75 stars)C) Okay (0.50 stars)D) Dislike (0.25 stars)E) Hate (0 stars)Explain your answer: The writing, was very average. Nothing special. Mediocre at best. Unless you’re counting Max dialogue. The suspense was nonexistent. The chapters were too short. WHY ARE THE CHAPTERS THAT SHORT. The POV gets an annoying meter rating of 10000/10. We get a first-person POV from Avery, and just [insert screaming]. As if Avery wasn’t annoying enough, we have to get thoughts STRAIGHT FROM HER HEAD. The pacing wasn’t altogether terrible, just boring. A little bit on the too-fast side. I didn’t find myself wanting to continue but just get it over with. AND WHY ARE THE CHAPTERS SO SHORT. ---------------------------Question 5: How did you find the conflict/resolution?A) Love (1 star)B) Like (0.75 stars)C) Okay (0.5 stars)D) Dislike (0.25 stars)E) Hate (0 stars)Explain your answer:I didn’t see that coming. But I had no idea what I was even supposed to see coming. It really wasn’t that surprising. Dull, like the rest of the book.---------------------------Total: (1/5)Deductions & Bonuses:-1 because i truly hated this bookFinal Total: (2/5)Other notes:- I’m so glad I didn’t buy this book when I had the chance to. Oh, the horrors. *shudders*- The sister is named Libby and I was reading this on Libby and I was laughing out loud like half the time.- I sincerely apologize to anyone who loved this book, it just wasn't for me. Other Reviews:The Hawthorn Legacy: (UPDATE 9/9/21) the book is out and im in the mood to rant so yes, i will be reading and most likely ranting

3828344552	THERAPY!!! THERAPY FOR ALL OF YOU! my thoughts (mild spoilers ahead)• i ain't never seen four emotionally intelligent brothers. two of them always gotta have unaddressed trauma.• the young adult threshold for personality is in HELL. all you need to do is give your teenage main character a vaguely tragic past, enough stubbornness to allow her to mildly bump heads with love interests every once in a while, a weakness for hot emotionally unavailable rich boys, and a best friend of color to carry things (for flavor).• not this billionaire secretly surveilling a low income teenage girl for most of her adolescence while she's struggling to stay afloat and literally living out of her car? taking and saving photos of her without her knowledge? and hoarding his wealth all the while? while she's barely scraping by? until the day he dies and finally decides—now that he no longer needs that wealth—it'll all go to her in exchange for using her as a pawn in his family's trauma olympics? GUILLOTINE!• LIKE? ARE YOU DERANGED? JUST HIRE A FAMILY THERAPIST? YOU LITERALLY HAVE EVERY RESOURCE AT YOUR DISPOSAL?• i clocked the endgame from the moment the hawthorne brothers were introduced, which is always irritating, because love triangles only really work (at least for me) when there seems to be a genuine struggle to decide between two equally interesting, three dimensional characters. • not to get into semantics, but if faced with a choice between two rich white boys, why NOT PICK THE ARTISTIC PHILANTHROPIST? WHO IS GENTLE AND FORGIVING? AND WASN'T PLAYING A BULLSHIT HOT AND COLD GAME WITH AVERY'S HEART BECAUSE HE IS EMOTIONALLY UNHINGED WITH THE MENTAL MATURITY OF A 13 YEAR OLD GTA GAMER?• this is how all of jameson and avery's interactions went:"can you point me to the bathroom?" i asked."he who leaves the game, loses, heiress," he said."please, i really have to pee, can you just—""the ball always looks for the best player," he replied with the glint of a grin, cutting me off."jameson, please—""play alone and you’re bound to win, mystery girl."• THIS MAN DID NOT HAVE A PERSONALITY. HE WAS JUST A TRENCH COAT OF FORTUNE COOKIE QUOTES. FLEXED HIS ABS A LITTLE AND CALLED IT A DAY. • the amount of times the narrator repeats lines of dialogue verbatim in her head did in fact give me a migraine. • xander was the best brother—a puppy, if you will—and i stand by that.• this was textbook young adult in that i could feel the plot mechanics moving as i zipped through the pages. the inheritance games is very much a predictable "mystery" that ended up slowed down by the tediousness of a love triangle i still don't really buy.• HOW OLD IS AVERY? are we ever gonna ask that? because she's interacting romantically with adult men as a minor? just wondering hehe• on that note, this concept would have been so much better if the characters were all college-aged. imagine the shock, the intrigue, the comedy of a low income, jeff bezos-hating college student with loans out the ass suddenly coming into billions? and having to live with two hot white guys? this concept is a lot funnier than it was written. buying into a high school girl solving a billionaire's years-long puzzle and catching the attention of the 18 + 19 year old brothers while she's at it is just a bit too much of a stretch, even for ya.• i also can't get over the whole emily subplot. this book was literally just....avery: Mf's be in relationships with their dead cheating Gf for like 3-5 years 😒 like damn other ppl wanna date you too 🙋‍♂️❗️😂🤣 and for most of the novel, that is exactly how jameson and grayson act. then 75% in, jameson suddenly changes his tune and goes the whole "i actually don't care about emily at all despite constant references to and comparisons between you and her” route. like, okay, buddy. having said all of that, yes, i will be picking up book two for gay ally and HoC (Hawthorne of Color) xander.
4713618779	Traps upon traps . . . and riddles upon riddles. Yes! Except, no. The thing is, if you're going to promise me puzzles and riddles, you'd better deliver. And The Inheritance Games fell way short.Avery is your standard teenager trying to get through high school when she receives news that billionaire Tobias Hawthorne has died and left her almost his entire fortune. The only stipulation is that she must move into his mansion and live there for one year. When she arrives, she meets the enigmatic family, including his four handsome grandsons. But it's all rather awkward since the old devil disinherited them all. Soon though, she realizes that he's got one more trick up his sleeve and it's up to her to figure it out.At first, this story reminded me of Knives Out, probably my favorite whodunnit film of all time. They both have the wealthy old man kicking the bucket and leaving his fortune to an outsider, along with a mystery/puzzle to solve. But that's where the similarities between the two end, and unfortunately, so did my enjoyment.At the very least, I expected the majority of this book to be about the puzzle that Avery is supposed to solve. But that was such a small part, and it was unnecessarily convoluted. Reading about her searching through every book and desk and tree on the property doesn't really quicken my pulse with excitement. And the end result is so lame, I forgot it almost as soon as I read it.Instead, the majority of this book is spent on very immature interpersonal drama between Avery and the ten other teenagers in here (the four brothers, her sister and her sister's ex, her only friend, and three other girls). If that sounds like a lot of people, I assure you, it was.None of the characters have real personalities, so I had a hard time keeping straight who was who. Especially among the four brothers, it felt like they were all approximately the same person, just slightly apart in age. They all spoke in the same ostentatious way and all seemed to have varying degrees of crushes on Avery.In fact, the romances in here really confused me. It seems like every teenager was in some sort of romantic entanglement/flirtation with every other teenager. There were so many implied love triangles and quadrangles, I really just didn't get it. Why is all this in here, other than to fluff out the pages?The other thing that really got on my nerves is the dialogue. It's somehow both bland and pretentious. It's basic as can be, but presented as if it's some sort of witty repartee worth savoring. Then to further rub salt in the wound, random dull sentences are treated like epiphanies, italicized and repeated over and over, just so the reader wouldn't miss it when they come across it for the tenth time.Unfortunately, this was a case of overpromising and underdelivering. The best part of the book was the premise and initial pages. As I read on, the mind-numbing dialogue and YA melodrama/romance between all the characters really grated on me. Add to that the underwhelming conclusion, and I'm sorry to say that this is really not for me. Maybe if I were still a teenager, I would enjoy this more. But that's too many decades in the past for me to remember now.As an aside, if you've never seen Knives Out, I totally recommend it. It's absolutely fabulous and actually lives up to the premise. Imagine that.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧
3390016267	I found this book absolutely delightful. Exactly the fast-paced, entertaining escape I was looking for!Comparisons to Knives Out were pretty accurate, though that says nothing about all the puzzles, riddles, and pretty guys that make The Inheritance Games virtually unputdownable. I don't care that that one twist was obvious-- everything about the journey of this book was delicious!The Inheritance Games follows Avery Grambs, a poor orphaned girl with a plan to work hard, get into a good school, and leave her shitty life behind forever. But then something unbelievable happens. Billionaire Tobias Hawthorne leaves his fortune to Avery in his will, even though Avery has never met him, never seen him, and, as far as she knows, has no link to him whatsoever. Even stranger, the will sets out a series of odd requirements. One being that Avery must spend at least one year in Hawthorne house, the family manor, and that she must allow Tobias's disinherited family to live there with her. Talk about awkward. And maybe even dangerous.Hawthorne House is a sprawling mansion of hidden passageways and dark secrets. The more time Avery spends there, the more she becomes convinced that the will, the letter she received alongside it, and the house are all clues to something bigger; that Tobias Hawthorne is playing a game from beyond the grave. Add to this Tobias's angry daughters, the media who won't leave her alone, and the four Hawthorne grandsons (Nash, who wants to take care of everyone, Grayson, the enigmatic businessman, Jameson, the adventurous rebel, and playful Alexander) and it's clear Avery is in way over her head. Unlucky for her; pretty thrilling for me, honestly.I love puzzles and riddles. In fact, I don't usually enjoy YA mystery because I can never understand why they decide to be detectives and don't call the police, but here it makes a lot more sense because Avery and the Hawthorne brothers are not crime-solving, they are puzzle-solving. It's very fun. Also, I sound about twelve years old, but, hell, do I love me some short chapters 😂There may be a love triangle brewing here, if that's something that bothers you. It's not totally clear, but it is suggested that there's something between Avery and more than one of the Hawthorne brothers. Still, I don't care when a book is this enjoyable.
3551926316	A+ idea, D execution. What a letdown. I wanted a puzzles and riddles and games. I wanted questions with seemingly impossible, shocking answers. I wanted a posse of fascinating, well-developed characters with secrets. I wanted complicated, dramatic romantic entanglements and family drama in spades. Instead, The Inheritance Games is slow and a tad dull, light on the puzzles and "games." The drama feels forced and I never felt engaged with the characters. In fact, Avery's two potential "love interests," brothers Grayson and Jamison are indistinguishable. Until the very end, I was at a loss who was who and what I was supposed to know about each of them. Which makes it difficult to feel anything but apathy when the romantic tension comes to a head.And then there's the lackluster ending with a "twist" I did not care about and a cliffhanger (apparently this is a series for some baffling reason) that left me frustrated. Why did I waste my time on this book if I was going to get zero resolution? There is not enough plot here for more books. Hello, cash grab. How disappointing.2.5 stars
3732567988	Rating this solely based on how much fun I had buddy reading this with my friend, cuz screw it, why not? This is a fun Cinderella story tailored specifically for anyone who enjoys Knives Out, reverse harems, and wish fulfillment stories for poor girls. There's just something satisfying about seeing a poor humble girl get a buttload of money while the rich don’t get anything. The mystery was surprisingly compelling: there were so many questions brought up, and every time there was a new development or answer, it would only unlock even more questions?! (“THIS MAKES NO DAMN SENSE! Compels me though…”) I also surprisingly liked all of the characters; they all have strong personalities, unique qualities, and fun dialogue. Though I don’t buy the instant attraction some of the characters have with each other, the dynamics and relationships between them are interesting enough for me to not mind it. I would definitely be open to reading the sequel.
3612987430	I, too, will be expecting a surprise billion-dollar inheritance as compensation for how much I suffered while reading this. Review to come...
4654239865	Ummmmm……
4178452281	i’m not gonna mince words, this sucked for me
3678194245	you know the saying ‘time flies when youre having fun?’ thats the best way i can describe reading this. it felt like i had just started it when all of a sudden it was over. i could have easily read another 300 pages of this.as everyone is saying, this has a very ‘knives out’ meets ‘truly devious’ vibe with a little bit of ‘paper princess’ thrown in there. its fun, full of riddles and games, all wrapped around a mysterious inheritance. its honestly better than i was expecting it to be. im also so glad i realised this is the first book in a series, because i was about to go off about that ending. there are so many questions that are left unanswered, so im relieved to know the story will continue because my curiosity is going haywire!↠ 4 stars
5143808310	That old man really did have a lot of free time and nothing better to do. He must be laughing up at them from hell.
3673321259	WHATit did not just end like that i-also, jameson and grayson are mine😼 i cant choose oneah, its been so long since I last read a mystery and this just made me remember how much I miss it. Once again, I have fallen in love. The characters, the plot, everything about this was just amazing. Excuse me while I suffer waiting until September for book 2.✌════▣◎▣════ “If there's one thing the Hawthorne family isn't, it's fine. They were a twisted, broken mess before you got here, and they'll be a twisted, broken mess once you're gone.” I still can't get over that Avery just randomly got called to inherit a billionaire's fortune?? How awesome is that? You don't even know said billionaire and have never come across anyone close to them and yet you get all the money that was originally all supposed to go to his grandsons???I couldn't stop laughing when that happened. They were sooo pissed it was hilarious. Although I can't blame them, I would've wanted to kill her... which is probably why she got all those death threats-ouch.I love Avery. She's literally so smart and the way she wouldn't let her personal feelings get in the way in trying to find solve the case was really admirable. Also, being able to show no emotion on her face?? I wish I could do that -- it sounds so cool and it'd be really useful for me during those games of chess i lose.And Jameson ahhh Jamie my bby🥺 demon mashie mentioned how he gives off Matthew Fairchild vibes and seriously why is that so true??? TLH has gotten to us smh.But anyways, I'm in love with his chaoticness (thats not a word) ughh I'm seeing a trend in the type of guys I keep falling for. i mean, he's like matthew so how could i not love him?? Getting drunk to run away from his problems and acting like a maniac even sober... I love it. And the way he talked omg- "If I do what I should no more often than I say what I shouldn't—" his lips twisted—"then what does that make me?" I had no idea what he was saying here?? Although he was drunk, so maybe that's why, but ohmygod I literally spent 10 minutes trying to understand that sentence. god i love jamie.🥺 oh what a coincidence that he has the same nickname as james herondale...okay ill stop nowOkay, and then there's the broody older brother, Grayson, who I absolutely despised at first, but he's actually so sweet??? I can't blame him for always putting his family first sdfsdfs what is this? Me falling in love with two potential love interests for the love triangle?? oh no, not good, not good. *cries* is it too much to ask for both of them to be happy?There was also Nash, the oldest brother of the 4, but I don't like him. There's something off about him and I just cant with him. Now Xander, the youngest one, is such a sweet cinnamon roll. The bright and happy one of the group... or so it seems. Who knows? I definitely can't wait to see more of him next book hehe “Sometimes things that appear very different on the surface are actually exactly the same at their core.” This has to be the first time that one of the first few guesses I made ended up being right?? I am beyond shocked. This needs to be marked in history. I, Lia Demonstairs, have actually guessed correctly.ah, this feeling... so satisfying. But anyways, I had it from the beginning but throughout the book I kept changing because everyone was acting so sus. smh I still don't know who to trust!! what is this sorcery?? And that twist at the end --Dear Authors, you cannot just end a book like that. You're literally killing us. And when we die, we cant read the 2nd book, and when we cant read the book, that hurts you so in the end we both suffer, right? So why not take pity on our poor mortal souls and not end it like that?? Thank you.just kidding, the masochist in me loves this torture════▣◎▣════Buddy read with some demons krizzie, mash, lucy, ish, charm, and devika.i wish a billionare would leave me his fortune🥺
5091516527	broke girl comes into a lot of money. when will it be my turn 😍
4498867319	um… WOW. I did not expect this to be a 5 star read but it definitely is!! First of all, the plot is wild. Avery is just a normal high schooler, but then one day she finds out she’s inheriting billions of dollars from a random guy and she has no idea why. And she has to live with his disinherited family. And that family includes 4 brothers around Avery’s age. The mystery of the inheritance is definitely the main plot but the romance was also 👌🏻. And I was on the edge of my seat the entire time as the characters try and solve riddles and look for clues to find the reason behind the inheritance. Would highly recommend! I will be reading the sequel immediately
3895588027	2.5 stars. “Sometimes things that appear very different on the surface are actually exactly the same at their core.” my spotify playlist Disclaimers: 1. If you haven't read the book and want to, but don't want any spoilers, please don't read any further. It seems like I can't restrain myself when it comes to write a review without any single spoiler. I'm sorry, I didn't ask for this, lmao.2. I'm sorry in advance because I tend to deviate from the main topic, like a lot. A lot. While I was taking a shower and cutting my hair (this is what happens when you leave me alone for like 10 minutes with my own thoughts and with scissors very close), I had the time of writing my review in my mind because I'm the kind of person who has to do like 2 or 3 things at the same time or I get desperate. Multitasking? Perhaps. Let's call it like that.So, let's begin because there's a lot to unpack.I read a couple of reviews without spoilers saying that this book was like Knives Out and I really love Knives Out, so I picked it up and hoped for the best... Well, well, well, look how it turned out.Avery Grambs is a common girl with a common YA life: absent parents, average girl with average appearance, a really smart student. So, everything's fine here. Until one day, she's summoned to Hawthorne House because it turns out that Avery inherits all the money that Tobias Hawthorne has in his will. A random girl with no connection or memories of Tobias Hawthorne is inheriting his entire fortune, like 100B dollar. (Holy shit, the amount of books that I'd buy with that money!)But the thing is that everyone is asking who the hell is Avery Grambs, where did she come from? Why is Tobias Hawthorne picking her to inherit all of his money? Is there something special with this girl? The plot: I can't complain a lot. To be a mystery book, it was fine. Just fine. There wasn't anything special or that blew my mind and that you found me saying "holy shit, I didn't see that coming", because I honestly could guess many things, lmao. It was fast paced, which was cool. The beginning tho wasn't so gripping and interesting as I thought: it was rather boring and I really thought of dnf at chapter 13 or so, lmao.However, there were many things that felt off for me. Like for example, how some chapters jumped to another things/situations totally different from the last chapter. Like we didn't have a proper closure or knew how things ended up. I don't know if I'm explaining myself because it seems like I suck at explaining, yikes.The end of the book left me "???" because I had right one of my theories: Toby is alive. But, Toby being Harry was something that came out of the blue, why? Oh, because we didn't have any clue about it! I can't think of any clue that links Harry with being Toby, at all. My two theories for this (in the second book) is that he escaped to that fire to become a "regular" guy, or that he had a plan with his father, Tobias, I don't know to this point. This was really messy. Characters: Avery: I don't hate her, tbh, but I'm not a big fan of bland girls. I found out that my girl over here and I share MBTI: we are INTJ. I'm not saying that I could have solved those puzzles really quick like she did, but, it doesn't seem a little bit... easy? I felt it that way, tho. (For being INTJ myself, I'm not like a smart person when it comes to numbers, that's why I picked up literature as my career, lol, but I love solving some problems) I don't know how to explain this, but I felt like everything was so easy for Avery and the Hawthorne brothers. I also want to know more of Avery, that she stands up for herself and stop being so bland. Honey, you're better than this, I know that. Jameson: I kind of liked him... Until I didn't. I came to totally dislike him. One moment he was okay for me and then he was being a total jerk. He was boring as hell. The only line where I agreed with thim was with this: "Where are you going?""Hell, eventually". Otherwise, I was rolling my eyes everytime he appeared. The kiss scene was really weird and awkward to me. Also, very disappointing. Jameson wasn't really thinking in Avery when he kissed her AFTER ALMOST BEING SHOT (I say almost because the Drake missed it and hit the tree). No, my dude over here was thinking about the mystery and possibly on Emily. He became grumpy towards the end just to give Grayson the space and chance to make his move with Avery. Grayson: I was hesitant with him being a total asshole. But I get it: he wanted to protect his family. I wanted to beat the shit out of him on the first chapters... And then, I was like "he's hot" and started to questioning myself about this fact. However, he, as his brothers and Avery, felt bland. Like, c'mon, dude, have a little more of personality. His lasts scenes with Avery, the romantic ones, were so random for me. One moment he was saying "stay away from my family" and the next one he was saying "I'm going to protect you". LIKE WHAT, HOW?? Xander; Nash: They were actually my favorite characters, lmao. Xander is my favorite favorite (yes, x2), he's such a cutie and I kind of saw coming that he knew his grandpa's plan/game to keep them together. For me, it was very obvious since the moment that Xander said that he saw his brothers fight for win while he was close to his grandpa and ate with him. Xander is funny and charming. Nash also was okay, with his cowboy boots and his lazy smile. I can't complain of him, tho I wished he would've had some more of participation. I need more of these two boys, ok? ok. Libby; Max: Libby just was there. If she has a bigger purpose, then I want to know it. Just don't make her invisible or make her appear in key moments and then forget about her... Like the author did. (That's how I felt it). I want to know more of my goth girl. Max was okay, and she was totally right when she told Avery that she never asked her how she, Max, was feeling, if she was okay, etc. But that was it. We didn't see or knew anything else from Max anymore. Like, she gave her speech and then left the chat for good. The false swearing was getting into my nerves, please.I for sure hated (in its entirety) the fact that 60% of the book was "Emily was like this...", "Emily would have done that...". Emily, Emily, Emily, and she's dead. I was getting exasperated. Is everything spinging around her?I would have also liked to see more of the Hawthorne family, their struggles or things like that, their reasons to do what they do. Like the foundation that Zara was helping was only mentioned and explored ONCE and then, nothing. Nada. The school was not explored very well, or the kind of treats that Avery could have received there. The romance/love triangle: I'm not a big fan of love triangles... I'm not a fan of that trope. Period. Even more when they're not well developed and it's clear as day with whom the mc will end up with. It seemed like Jameson was pushing himself away from Avery just to give Grayson some space to make his "move", which was ridiculous and illogical. Avery was just a pawn.I didn't feel any connection between Avery and Jameson, nor Avery and Grayson. I don't ship them because I don't think that they have chemistry or a spark. One moment, he's threatening Avery and the next one he's pinning for her. How did this happen? I was so confused by this. And I still am. The same guys who were "in love" with Emily are falling for Avery... Seriously? Hype: I understand part of the hype for this book, I really do. But it wasn't for me. I don't know if I am the problem or what, but I found some characters annoying and bland, or some things unbelievable. Overall was okay, nothing new, nothing that blew my mind or left me shocked, just okay.Am I going to pick up the second book to see how things go? Perhaps, If I'm on the mood, lmao.With that money, you can pay me therapy, because after this book, I really need it. previous review: i'm gonna give you a chance. let's see if the hype is worth it, lmao
6266870606	⋆ ˚ 🗽 ⋆ ࿔ 4.75 stars – spoilers are marked⋆ˊˎ “a very risky gamble.” ATE. THIS. UP. and the plot twist in the end—OH MY GOD. it's the reason i'm so excited for book 2!! i know that i will thoroughly enjoy this entire series, so, i'm really excited for that!!! i also loved how fast-paced this was! that's always great in books for me. and OH MY GOD some of the quotes in this were so good! JAMESON/AVERY FOR LIFE THOUGH. Grayson and her were cute too.⋆ˊˎ “i've seen the way jameson looks at you.” the mystery, the puzzles & the romance were all amazing! the mystery had me hooked, the puzzles had me continuously guessing, and the romance was SPECTACULAR! i'm team Jameson/Avery and he's my favourite, but, nonetheless, i loved all four hawthorne brothers. nash is the most handsome cowboy ever, grayson is really hot plus i'm so down bad for blonde guys, jameson ... he's just the excellent, no words for him; he's super handsome and everything and he also gives me slight cardan vibes and, lastly, xander is quirky and has great humour. ⋆ˊˎ “jameson winchester hawthorne is hungry. ” the negative things about this book were that there were a few characters i didn't like. i didn't really have any problems with this book other than that except for the fact that i'm slightly disappointed i couldn't rate this 5 stars as i really hoped for that, but 4.75 is close enough!⋆ˊˎ “you're not a player, kid—you're the glass ballerina or the knife.” the ending (view spoiler)[ with toby was so surprising. everything about the ending was surprising, from everyone solving the mystery to them also finding out about toby—it was all so shocking.

3506641639	Hmmm....Not quite there but nevertheless still interested to read the sequel. 3 STARS__OMFG THIS BADASS COVER!!!!??‘Cinderella meets Knives Out’BRUH GIMMIE!!
5014103609	I want to reread this already. The mystery in here was amazing. I was so invested and wanted to solve all the riddles. I took breaks to solve the riddles because I wanted to be fully in the story. I loved Avery and her entire story. Her development was really interning and I loved seeing how invested she got in solving the riddles the longer she stayed at the Hawthorne house. Her relationship with Xander and Libby were definitely my favorite. And I was team Jameson. I kept trying to compare it to how Juliette first fell for Adam and then Warner because everyone was team Grayson but nope. I am a fan of Jameson till the day I die. I loved his introductions and the mistakes he made were one not fun but two made sense for what character he was supposed to portray. Now I do need to mention that Grayson and Jameson need to go too therapy because these people hate themselves more than I hate myself and I go to therapy. I also really liked the development of the plot and the secrets were revealed in a way that made the tension rise and rise. The pacing was also really nice and since I was invested from the beginning, the foreshadowing and little hints were visible at times but after reading the reveals, all of them were clear. I think that was my favorite part because I could really tell that everything was planned out even before Jennifer started writing the first page. Sometimes authors come up with the plot as they go on with the story but it was clear how everything was thought through and it was amazing. The Hawthorne brothers were also all great individual characters and here are my rankings for them:Nash is my husband I do not care what anybody say. I have never been attracted to a guy with a cowboy hat so this was funny. Team Jameson for Avery. Sometimes I wanted Avery to just be team avery. Xander is my best friend and we would solve riddles together. Grayson is too much like me and hates himself. last note: Using Max as a comedic relief by not cussing was annoying
3575069210	one day i hope to be as much of a bad bitch as nan isgoing into this book i was a bit nervous because everyone said it was like knives out and when a book is compared to something i love i get nervous because they usually don't compare but this one definitely is amazing, it isn't too much like knives out actually. it also reminds me of the princess diaries and i'm not just saying that because there was a makeover scene. this book has great characters, the main character is so likable! and it has my favorite trope where a girl has to live with a bunch of brothers who are stand offish. it has a love triangle which i LOVE! but most importantly the mystery kept me on my toes. it's not very much a thriller but i still highly recommend this book!
3568515566	This was just alright for me. Maybe it's because I'm not super into young adult anymore, but I don't know I expected to love this book because of the comparison to Knives Out. This book was fine, the first 100 pages or so was exciting but after that I started to lose interest, and I could've done without the love triangle. I also didn't realize this book is the first in a series and was disappointed by a cliffhanger ending.
3581631543	As soon as I set my eyes on this addictive tale, I know I'll be dazed, confused, blubbering all right, all right, all right, transporting myself into the Hawthorne universe, with my grey cells jumping up and down like corn kernels dancing inside a microwave before turning into popcorn. The puzzles, riddles, cryptic messages, and the irresistible charm of the four brothers draw me into this unputdownable mystery that promises a complex mashup of Knives Out meets Game with haunted mansion vibes!Most readers find themselves torn between Team Grayson and Jameson (as a fine whiskey drinker, it's obvious which team I should be on, but the jury is still out!). I couldn't decipher much about the boys' characters to decide which one is better for our smart, edgy, quirky Avery, and so far, only Xander has stolen my heart with his sarcastic tone, robotic intelligence, and his scone addiction (I agree, who chooses lemon ones over blueberry scones!). The plot intrigued me with its fast, fresh start as soon as Avery Grambs gets introduced, bearing many similarities to Beth Harmon's character played by Anya Taylor-Joy in Queen's Gambit. She's an orphaned girl, recently lost her mother, abandoned by her father, getting roommates with her half-sister Libby, who has a dysfunctional relationship with her abusive boyfriend. Instead of living with them, Avery prefers to live in her old car. But her fate suddenly changes when she meets charismatic tightrope walker Grayson Hawthorne in the principal's office, who tells her she's summoned to the will reading of gazillionaire Tobias Hawthorne, whom she never heard of and is probably not related to.But as soon as she flies to Texas, arriving at Hawthorne Mansion to meet the other three Hawthorne boys, including thrill-seeking free-spirited Jameson, who likes to push her buttons with several nickname choices for her, Nash: big brother reminiscent of young Yellowstone stars, Xander; sarcastic, clever, friendlier one who uses humor as a shield to heal his wounds, she feels like her life is never going to be the same, especially after hearing that she's the heiress of the Hawthorne inheritance! Of course, two daughters of Tobias have every intention to reject the will, turning this incident into a media circus as Grayson thinks she's a conwoman. And of course, Jameson sees her as another puzzle left by his grandfather that he should solve by teaming up with her. Why did Tobias Hawthorne leave her his entire legacy? Why did he leave a note to her saying he was sorry? Is she really the last piece of the puzzle left to the family to solve, which may reveal so many secrets, including a girl's death in their hands? I loved the pacing, the mysterious concept, the tense atmosphere! The romantic triangle didn't affect me because I don't have much clue to resonate with any of the boys. I only loved Xander so far, and luckily he had no romantic inclination with Avery! The cliffhanger also intrigued me a lot! I cannot wait to start the second book, even though there are so many mixed reviews for the preceding two books. I am already addicted, and even though there's a risk of disappointment, I'm volunteering to go blind and see what will happen next! Crossing my fingers to entertain myself as much as this first book did by giving it my five stars!Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter
4989074237	This book reminded me of The Hunger Games.....The Inheritance Games is a Young Adult novel which focuses on down-on-her-luck high school student, Avery.The book is a combined Rags to Riches and Quest plot when Avery, who has lost her mother and is living in her car, find herself inheriting billions of dollars from a stranger. Will she discover why she was chosen?Action packed and the pages were flying with these relatively short chapters. Even the fake swearing was entertaining.An incredibly enjoyable, fascinating read, but I wanted a bit more from Avery throughout the book. The beginning was well done, but I wanted to know more about what made Avery so unique. Also, there were a few scenes from The Hunger Games that just haunt me to this day, they stay with me, and The Inheritance Games just isn't there yet.2025 Reading ScheduleJan A Town Like AliceFeb BirdsongMar Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr War and PeaceMay The Woman in WhiteJun AtonementJul The Shadow of the WindAug Jude the ObscureSep UlyssesOct Vanity FairNov A Fine BalanceDec GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta My Bookstore at Pango
4700058831	♧ Reread #1:Rereading this was literally so so fun!! 🤭🤭❤❤ Loved this series the first time round, so I had such a great time revisiting these characters and this story 🥰 I'd honestly completely forgotten the mystery, so some of the twists actually surprised me on the second time round too!! 🤭😂 So yeah, this series is amazing and deserves all the hype 💖💖Also, I'm still #TeamGrayson. GRAYSON SUPERIORITY 👊❤~~~~~~~~~~~Rereading ❤❤ I loved this series the first time round, so I'm so excited to read it again 🥳🥳~~~~~~~~~~~~Original review:This was SO GOOD!👌 I DEFINITELY understand the hype now. The Inheritance Games was a twisty, entertaining mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed. “Everything’s a game, Avery Grambs. The only thing we get to decide in this life is if we play to win.”Firstly, the characters. This book was from the point of view of Avery Grambs, a teenage girl who suddenly inherited an enormous fortune from billionaire Tobias Hawthorne, a guy she'd never met. His will said that, for her to get the money, she had to move into Hawthorne House, the sprawling, mystery-filled home of the wealthy Hawthorne family. Once she's moved in, she teams up with the handsome grandsons of Tobias Hawthorne to solve the mystery of why she inherited that money.I really liked Avery as a character. She was genuinely likeable and smart, and reading from her point of view was really enjoyable! However, despite being a great heroine, she is by no means the star of the show. Nope, that's definitely the Hawthorne grandsons themselves.😏🤭~ Grayson, the cold, calculating businessman~ Jameson, the trickster and troublemaker~ Xander, scone-obsessed and really fun~ And Nash, the cowboyMy favourite was Grayson, for obvious reasons, but I found them all intriguing and complex characters. Jameson was a really interesting (and sometimes confusing) character and I have a lot of respect for Xander's scone obsession (I mean, who doesn't love scones). As for Nash, I'm not an enormous fan of his, but I think there's a lot more to be discovered about him. I'm really looking forward to learning more about him and his brothers in the Hawthorne Legacy. 😁As for the romance, I'm firmly #TeamGrayson. WE LOVE THE COLD BUSINESSMAN ♥️“As awful as it sounds, money is power, and power is magnetic.” Now, onto the writing style. I'm a HUGE fan of Jennifer Lynn Barnes' writing style- it's rather simplistic, but this makes the book really easy to enjoy. I think the simplicity of the writing style really worked in this context, especially as it contrasted with the complex plot & characters. I really hope to read more of Jennifer Lynn Barnes' work in the future. 😏😏“Traps upon traps. And riddles upon riddles.”And lastly, the plot. THE PLOT. It was AMAZING!! I expected a great mystery, and it definitely delivered. With the plot being at a really fast pace and having twists & turns at every corner, I was riveted and absolutely desperate to find out more. AND THAT CLIFFHANGER---- 🤯🤯🤯🤯 I NEED THE NEXT BOOK NOW!! “He left you the fortune, Avery, and all he left us is you.”Overall, I loved this!! I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a fun mystery with great plot twists & an awesome cast of characters. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel! 😁💖~ 4 stars ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Really enjoyed this! Definitely the fun and twisty mystery I was hoping for. 😁 💕 RTC!
5642335977	looking for a lighthearted mystery novel with rivalry, puzzle solving, and a love triangle? the inheritance games!i was unsure if this book was going to be truly entertaining, but it really was a fun ride. the twists and turns this author takes you on keeps you guessing until the very end, and even at the end there’s a cliffhanger (book number 2 i’m coming for you).avery is flown out to an incredibly rich man’s house after he passes away to find out she inherits not only the house, but most of his money. she has no idea how she’s connected to this family, but they’re extremely unhappy that she inherited much more than them considering they don’t even know her. as time goes on she gains friends who go on an adventure to solve the mystery: why her? although, you never truly know who to trust in this novel. romance even sparks, but is it genuine? and are these family members more dangerous than she thought? either way, it’s clear this rich man loved puzzles and wants to send them on an adventure to solve this mystery. you will literally be finding out answers as you go along up until the very last page, so go read and have fun!
5542296371	i feel like the last person on my goodreads friends list to read this book… but better late than never, right?┏━━━━━❂ a quick warning ❂━━━━━┓i am in the worst reading slump i’ve probably ever had. it’s been like six months of a slump at this point and i’m just not enjoying books as much as i *could* normally if i weren’t slumping so hard. for that, i apologize. ┏━━━━━❂ what i liked ❂━━━━━┓❥ jennifer lynn barnes, you are the queen of short chapters and my slumping, ADHD brain thanks you for that ❥ the storyline was unique!! ❥ easy to read + quick to read❥ i love a good puzzle/mystery in a book❥ YA books just go so fast and are genuinely so fun, i can’t complain❥ Nash (to all of those who said i’d love him – you’re right)┏━━━━━❂ what i didn’t love ❂ ━━━━━┓❥ i don’t really think i’m a fan of a love triangle? especially within a family.❥ i don’t really know if *any* sort of romance/yearning was necessary in this first book?

3726600317	I love this book so much. I haven’t read this genre in so long and this is like a breath of fresh air. I need a second book immediately. I love these characters and it was so fun to read. It’s only getting four stars because it was kind of slow

6057725449	4⭐️ "Never lose your heart to a Hawthorne." THE PLOT Avery has a simple plan: survive high school, get a scholarship, and get out. One day at school, she is brought into the dean's office to discuss a private matter. She is informed that Tobias Hawthorne passed away and left everything to her...all his assets, businesses, money, everything. The only catch is that she has to live in the Hawthorne house for a year in order to claim everything. It seemed like a dream come true at first, until her life is put in danger by those inside and outside the house. Avery must solves riddles, puzzles, and gather clues in order to survive living in this house...even if it means taking help from the 4 Hawthorne brothers. MY THOUGHTS The Characters: I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters in this book! Well...maybe not Libby. I really didn't like her character very much. I found her to be kinda insufferable at times but I'll take the bad with the good. Okay I know we were supposed to fall for Jameson, but I liked Grayson more.😳 He's this morally grey, broody character that has that stoic attitude but if he told me to sit, I would be SAT. He really gives off that "touch her and you die" vibe (not literally this is very YA). I wish we got more of him. 😕 Nash though? NASH! Why is the oldest brother always one of the hottest? I will gladly take any of these men...Avery BACK OFF. I found Avery's character to be mid. I didn't find her all that unique or interesting in any aspect. I just didn't connect with her like I did with the brothers.The Plot: The amount of twists and turns this book takes you'd think you were on a roller coaster. This book is very very YA and I don't actually mind! I think the pacing of the book was great. You were never left bored and there wasn't a lot of filler. Everything in this book had a purpose and I loved that. I loved being on the ride of solving mysteries and finding clues it was so fun. I had such a great time reading this from start to finish. This book is told in first person and is 99% in Avery's POV, however the last chapter is Xander's POV.The Writing: I really enjoyed Jennifer's writing style! The chapters are so short and the way it's written makes it very easy to read and understand and also allows you to read it faster than many other books.Overall, I cannot wait to continue this series! I am hooked I want more Grayson, I want more mysteries, I want more of everything this book gave. I'm so excited to continue!! You guys were right I would fall in love with this series remind me never to doubt y'all again.🫡🩷 FAVORITE SCENES AND QUOTES "Everyone is going to want something from you soon, Heiress. The question is: How many of us want something you're willing to give?""Everything's a game, Avery Grambs. The only thing we get to decide in this life is if we play to win.""We aren't normal. This place isn't normal, and you're not a player, kid. You're the glass ballerina--or the knife.""Getting involved with Jameson would just be throwing gasoline on the fire.""And what a lovely fire it would be.""I told you the day we met that the Hawthorne family was a twisted, broken mess. I never said that I wasn't one, too."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I'M FINALLY STARTING THIS OMGGG it took me long enough! Let's see what all the hype is about 👀
3437448128	A Cinderella story with deadly stakes and thrilling twists, perfect for fans of One of Us is Lying and Knives Out.i am very much a fan of knives out and not so much of One of Us Is Lying, but fortunately for me, this is only like that book in that it is a fast-paced distraction-read. and YA. to me, it was like knives out meets the liza, bill, and jed series by peggy parish that i devoured as a kid, loving its scavenger-hunt mysteries and solve-along word-nerd clues. but i guess no one reads those anymore. they should. you should.the 'inheritance' part of this title is indeed very similar to knives out—a tension-filled will-reading with all the assembled heirs getting less than they'd expected, side-eyeing the charity case who's just been left billions by their eccentric relation. in this case, however, there's no suspicion of foul play, and the recipient of the money isn't the kindly care worker whose years of service have made her part of the family, it's a sixteen-year-old orphan who's been living with her half-sister (or, occasionally, in her car) with no connection to the family whatsoever, and no idea why she's been left this fortune along with a note from the deceased that simply says, "I'm sorry." and then the 'games' part of the title begins! because our dead billionaire liked a good puzzle, had a penchant for building secret passageways and hidden compartments and for pitting his four high-performing teenage grandsons against each other in competitive games featuring codes and wordplay and secrets. and avery grambs—this stranger in their midst—may be just another puzzle for the boys to crack.it's all short chapters and intrigue—a one-sitting book if you don't have to spend time baking snickerdoodle cheesecake and, while not without its problems, it is super-fun and will hold your attention and keep you from watching the news.yes, virginia, there are love triangles. there's a love triangle in the present-day narrative, there's a love triangle in the backstory-narrative, and—since there's a sequel on the horizon, it's safe to assume there's gonna be a love triangle in the future. it's not the book's best feature, but it doesn't overshadow the WHY WE'RE HERE of the story—which is for the puzzles and passageways. it helps that avery isn't dominated by her hormones—for the most part, she's practical and unfussy, smart and normal-person brave (as opposed to mary sue YA heroine brave). i will say, however, that these people are as casual about attempted murder as their mom is casual about being nekkid 'round the house mega-mansion. also: I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT BARK. show me the science on that scene, please, because deeply embedded beggars belief. the ending is a bit of a weeeeelllll, and so much of the book is a house of cards made out of convenient coincidences and fortunate stumbles orchestrated by an all-knowing master of foresight, but if you're turning to these kinds of books for your mirror-up-to-life fix, you're doing it wrong. i still have questions, and i expect some of them will be answered in the sequel, but i fear i may never learn who is in charge of stocking the fridge in a secret wing behind a combination lock with AN ARRAY of novelty sodas, all for the benefit of someone who comes and goes like a tomcat. also, where can i get a bacon and jalapeño soda?i hope the sequel sheds some light on this matter. in fact, i hope it is the sequel's central mystery.**********************************************1/7/21: today is definitely the day for an escapist book! ********************************************pre-review review: it strains credulity, but it's really fun. plus, i got the bn exclusive edition with the extra chapter, so i apologize to all the indie bookstores.full review to come.come to my blog!
4381977743	I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXTit gave me the same vibes as Truly Devious and A Good Girls Guide To Murder (both of which i’m obsessed with) and it’s so satisfying figuring out the puzzles with themi also enjoyed the character stories along side the mystery solving but i do find it hard to believe the reason for the whole game and think there must be something more to it!
3505345336	this was the most juvenile, average YA that i’ve ever read. literally nothing about it was special why does it have so much hype🧍🏽‍♀️
3746581069	I CANT TELL WHAT TEAM IM ON IM LOOSING IT THIS WAS SO GOOD
3526052779	“We aren’t normal. This place isn’t normal, and you’re not a player, kid. You’re the glass ballerina—or the knife.” HOLY SHIT.The thing with Jennifer Lynn Barnes' books is that...you can't get enough. No matter the circumstances, no matter the general plot, you can't help but enjoy her novels and find pleasure in reading them. Her main characters are always extremely relatable and the way she piles up plot twist after plot twist makes you crave for more even if, ironically, you'd die to unravel every mystery you're faced with. I feel like these books don't require a huge analysis because they're amazingly crafted and mainly aim to entertain, and it's just a plus that you get to spend some quality time with the mysteries and the characters dynamics, and read a book with this level of writing and exquisitely quick chapters, at the same time. I'll never stop being amazed by the high one of JLB's books always puts me on. They turn me into a voracious book junkie that doesn't even mind love triangles (although, I'm team Grayson all the way) and has a thing for highly saturated Agatha Christie's books based movies. __Remember when i was in love with jennifer lynn barnes and read 6 of her books in 2 days? meet me in 2020: different times, different books, still hopelessly in love.
4247404174	I have no idea how I feel about this. On one hand I did really enjoy it, but on another, there was a lot I didn't like about it. The plot wasn't very original or well executed. I love Knives Out, so I expected to love this, but that wasn't the case. Not only was the big plot twist in the end not even shocking, but the mystery was so confusing and there were too many plot conveniences. I hope that book 2 does a better job at answering all my unanswered questions and making things make sense...if that makes sense. As far as the characters go, Xander is the best sibling and character. I would say Grayson is second, he has potential. Jameson kind of got on my nerves. Nash's cowboy boots are a crime against humanity. Avery needs more character development, but whatever, I didn't hate her. Nan is such a girlboss. Libby is just kind of there. Emily is the bane of my existence. And yeah, overall, it is a good book, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I did find it lackluster in certain areas and I can't help but be a bit disappointed. ~ 3.5 stars; eat the rich, but also why can't that be me inheriting billions of dollars?
3962347317	If yes is a no and once is never. How many sides does a triangle have?I am still not over that riddle because how tf do you get 2? Anyway, I liked the plot and the writing style. The characters were interesting too. Sexy brothers, arrogant women, way too much money. We all love that. The tension was there and you never know who the main love interest really is. The plot twists were pretty unpredictable for me as well. Especially the ending🌚Basically, a nice light read. It consists of way too many and too short chapters, which many people like. Truly, I don’t have anything too bad to say about it. But damn this book put me into a mini reading slump. Idk why, it could be a me problem but I’d rather blame the book. P.S. When will a random billionaire die and leave everything to me?🥲The Hawthorne Legacy reviewThe Final Gambit review
3948259366	4.5 ⭐️ i never wrote a review for this.. i should be ashamed of myself. anyway. this was exactly what i needed to get out of the slump i’ve been in. it was such a refreshing read. the riddles, the puzzles, the characters & the plot were all so entertaining. and the romance subplot.. yes pls. team jameson forever <3
3829992878	UpdateI've just watched Knives Out and it's a thousand times better. The Inheritance Games has nothing on it other than similar premise at the very start. Do not compare them. ReviewThis book wins...The Most Underwhelming Book of the Year! And the first one star rating I give out this year, and the first angry rant review that's longer than four paragraphs. Don't read this review if you like the book. (Which I found out was the majority of the people uh oh)The plot was deceptively simple, lacking the depth it desperately needed. It was basically an escape the room game that didn't make strong sense, filled to the brim with unnecessary angst, inane conversations like “Why do you need extra security? Why does she need extra security?”“There was an incident yesterday. With a bullet and a tree.”“A bullet? Like, from a gun?” and love-at-first-sight he's so hawt descriptions from the MC, Avery Grambs.I can tell that the author tried to make the book mysterious...by letting the characters speak in the most annoying way possible. They threatened ambiguously or made floaty analogies. They cut off sentences in weird segments. It didn't make the book mysterious. It made me want to hit every character with this book.Everyone was quickly assigned a role in the book. E.g. “This is Xander. He's the baby of the family.”“I’m a hypercompetitive, bisexual perfectionist who likes to win.”Nobody talked to that girl. She was wallpaper. The four Hawthorne brothers who were supposed to be competing with Avery for 42 billion dollars were immediately identified as The Drunk One, The Calculating One, The Cowboy, and The Baby of the Family. Their mother was The Talky One. This is not a spoiler. They were literally introduced at the start of the book with attempts of character distinguishing that was sloppy and clichéd as hell, you can tell the author wanted you very much to immediately grasp how cold and calculating the Calculating One is.It was unbelievably annoying. People don't say everything according to an one-track personality. Meet Jameson Winchester Hawthorne, who Avery couldn't stop calling his full name every five pages. Other than having a mouthful of name, he was also the worst nickname giver of all times. He rotated between calling Avery Mystery Girl, MG, Heiress and Cinderella.I think it was supposed to be sexy or something, but it just made him sound incredibly unhinged. Just...be a little more creative!And then, against everything Avery has been told or common sense--she immediately began lusting after the guys??? And she wouldn't even pick one but two? Even just the sound of his voice, the way he phrased things--I could feel myself wanting to lean toward him. This was ridiculous.It is ridiculous. Despite the repeating cold treatment from one of the brothers, and despite that they were competitors for a mountainous sum of inheritance, she still spent most of her time hyperventilating whenever they came too close. And spent the rest of the time telling herself that she should not be attracted to the guys.Then there was the time that Avery found out a girl mattered to the boys and she felt hurt. After Avery met the Hawthorne boys for a whopping two days. She was also constantly disappointed when she found out the guys were just interested in her as a puzzle solver, even though she'd told herself and had been told a thousand times that she was just a game piece. It shouldn't still come to a surprise to her!Nothing about Jameson's reaction should have surprised me, so why did it hurt?Why was I letting it hurt?Because you're stupid.I’d always been good at math. I'd always been logical. THEN USE YOUR BRAIN!!!There was this completely idiotic scene where Avery realized that the four brothers stands together as a family and she was the intruder. After she met them for one day. YES. OF COURSE YOU ARE THE INTRUDER. You just met them. You're supposed to be smart. Use common sense. You shouldn't have to realize that.From what I read, she was not smart. She used her brain in solving puzzles, but at the big moments, she was rash, completely governed by her mood. She rushed forward even though everyone told her not to, and told people things she had been explicitly forbidden to say. But no one in this book has particularly high IQ points so I guess it doesn't really matter.I just can't.
3551180805	“Sometimes things that appear very different on the surface are actually exactly the same at their core.” Buddy read with the precious midnight mansion ; Lucy , demon Lia , Ish , Mashiee and Charms <3 love... Okay first i have too say this WHY is this compared too one of us is lying. The blurb says '' for fans of one of us is lying '' i personally hated one of us is lying , it has a poor offensive mental health rep used as a plot twist and is full of highschool drama and high school tropes also its a murder mystery? This isnt that at all so i really dont get the comparing but oh well. Needed too get this off my chest first. So if you like me hate one of us is lying , still give this a shot cause its nothing a like. The inheritance games By Jennifer Lynn Barnes is the first book in the inheritance games series. Its a mystery that takes place in a huge mansion with huge mansion vibes and secret passages and hiding places and lots of libaries [ can i life here please ? , i loved the vibes it gave off i could see myself playing hide and seek there ] that bellonged too Tobias Hawthrone who has died [ rip] and now the rest of the family still lives there with on the main focus in this book , his 4 rich grandsons. Then we have Avery , the main charracter who lives a poor life and is suddenly brought too this mansion and is told that Tobias , who she doesnt know at all has left her all his money and belongings including the house :o so she is a billionaire in one second. The mystery focusses on Avery trying too find out why a man she doesnt know left her everything and his own family almost nothing while she also gets in the life of the Hawthorne grandsons. The plot this book was for me an enjoyable mystery read , i liked the setting in the house and the mystery the boys have and the whole family. i felt like i was standing besided Avery finding everything out or even was her. We have a lot of clues and i liked getting them together and thinking about them and everytime a bit more is revealed which kept me on my toesss. The ending i personally found meh. It basically has two plottwistst/answers kinda + a cliffhanger. The cliffhanger i loved and one of the twistst , the other one had me a bit meh , i expected more of that. (view spoiler)[the bit of the son of tobias being alive and being the one that played chess with avery in the park WTF ??? I STAN. but the bit of avery basically being random chosen was a bit meh for me , i expected some more reasons because of that.... (hide spoiler)] Charracters We have the main charracter Avery Nash nash is kinda weird idk i dindnt love him , he basically doesnt want anything too do with the money. Then we have Grayson the second oldest son who is a grumpy one and doesnt trust Avery and things she is faking her '' i dont know anything '' thing. Gayson i liked more as the book continued , then we have Jameson I STAN JAMESON. This boy aaah. he is sassy , he is is moral grey , can we trust him ? oh also can we trust any of these brothers and this family hm? and then we have Xander the youngest brother who is a lil cupcake and loves scones and is very witty , i also enjoyed him. but can we trust ? HM. might. i liked the mystery aspect the family and the brothers have and their dynamic with Avery. Romance there isnt a lot of romance we basically have kinda a love triangle between Grayson + Avery and Jameson + Avery. I liked the interactions between them but i liked Jameson and Avery the most. I didnt really mind the love triangle ish here. Overall i think this is a good fun mystery book that has lots of great vibes and i loved figuring all of the things out and was kept on my toes the entire time. I finished it in two settings so yay. I reccomend if you want a fun mystery that is set in a rich people house.
4630156806	4 stars ★i did not expect this book to be this good. seriously. it's fun to read, it's engaging, it doesn't drag out or bore you, it's fast, it's clever, and the ending !! i was so sure it would be a simple cliffhanger, but i kid you not, this is what happened: i checked how many pages were left -> read the last page -> sat up straight and moved forward in my seat because that was literally the last fricking thing i was expecting -> re-read the last page again -> sat in silence for 3 minutes. the riddles are so clever, even though i wouldn't have been able to solve a single one of them (i'm too dumb 😭🤝🏻) but it was still fun to see them put their minds together and solve everything.↠ avery: she is such a good mmc. the part where she starts feeling completely alone, like there's no one at her side, got to me so bad, i wanted to give her a hug. and her saying she spent her entire life feeling like wallpaper and just wanted someone to see her as special, beneath everything. ugh i wanted to cry, that hit too close to home.it makes her indecisiveness between the brothers so much more understandable, cause she's going to take what she can get - she wants love and affection. she wants to matter to someone (she's just like me minus the brainiac + money part).↠ jameson: hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe. he can play all the games he wants with me 😌🎀 i'll play 'em.joke's aside, he is literally the kind of character i ADORE. the reckless ones, without any fear and single-focus type 😭🤸🏻‍♀️🙏🏻 A+, 10/10.↠ grayson: honestly, i didn't like him much at the start, but he slowly grew on me. he actually cares so so much about people close to him 😭🎀 i can understand why so many people love him (even though i'm a jameson girlie 100%).↠ avery + jameson: UMMM THE OFF THE CHARTS CHEMISTRY, the way they put their minds together to solve everything, THE KISS BYE I DIED that was so hot when she pushed him against the wall 😫🤚🏻, the DYNAMICS, the NICKNAME, when she said she needed jameson to solve the riddle, "mystery girl", COMPLETING EACH OTHER'S THOUGHTS, literally the most perfect match ugh ugh ugh.↠ side characters: i loveeeed the hawthorne brothers and their dynamic by the end was so good 😭😫 the remaining hawthorne family was annoying af ngl. nash hawthorne i swear if i wasn't a jameson girlie, i would've been a nash girlie like???? 😫🤸🏻‍♀️💅🏻 the vibes he exudes, damn. libby is the sweetest thing ever, max gets the bff award, oren and alisa LITERALLY UNDERRATED 🙏🏻 those two kept avery alive.↠ the riddles: literally so freaking clever. even though i could never solve them. also, the anagram thing? DAMN.teenage me being baffled by "tom marvolo riddle" being an anagram for "i am lord voldemort" 🤝🏻 adult me being baffled by "avery kylie grambs" being an anagram for "a very risky gamble."↠ the money: a major thing no one talks about. like pls, avery, you know you’re living my dream right? 😭 she really got:- a gun collection- a car collection- EVERY FREAKING TYPE OF GAME?- infinite libraries WITH SIGNED FIRST EDITIONS- private helicopters and whatnot- billions- a freaking NFL team- private bowling alley- mansion- private gym- a freaking hotel(pretty sure i missed some stuff) ALL OF THEM OVERNIGHT. PLS I DESERVE THAT TOO 😭 idc i need money. i'm broke. and all of the things being the absolute best, most expensive versions 🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️ I YEARN.if i got that much money, the last thing i would do was play riddles. probably why i didn’t get it. 10/10 recommend.

5276371162	The Inheritance Games war eine Empfehlung aus der Community, ohne diesen Anstoß hätte ich vielleicht nicht zu dem Buch gegriffen und eine fesselnde Geschichte und faszinierende Charaktere verpasst - danke an der Stelle🤭! Es ist immer ein gutes Zeichen, wenn ich nach Beenden weiterhin an das Buch denken muss. Rätsel, Mystery, Familiengeheimnisse, Intrigen und eine Protagonistin, die bereits in ihren ersten Sätzen greifbar wurde. Greifbar waren auch alle anderen Charaktere, die in ihren Dialogen Vielschichtigkeit bewiesen, während meisterhaft damit gespielt wurde, ihre Motive zu verschleiern. Besonders begeistern konnte mich überraschenderweise der Schreibstil. Überraschend deshalb, weil ich normal gedankenreiche, emotionale Stile bevorzuge und hier eher kurz, präzise und subtil erzählt wurde. Gerade das hat aber super gepasst und viel Tempo ins Storytelling gebracht, sodass es spannend blieb. Auch wenn es noch mehr Twists oder Thriller-Elemente hätte geben können, bewerte ich dieses Buch danach, wie viel Spaß ich beim Lesen hatte: Ganz viel nämlich😍😂!

3527439038	DNF’d at about 60%.I’m not even gonna touch the comparison to Knives Out or the other one because whenever the blurb is _for fans of —— and ——_ the book is never actually like what it’s compared to.Wanted to like it, except the main character was constantly distracted by good looking teenagers about her age. Very love triangle-esque except it was all based their looks. Not real love or even mutual respect. One of them would pass by her and happen to brush her arm and the inner monologue about it just killed me.Her Mom died two years ago but she barely gets mention beyond that she may have kept secrets. Maybe we learn more in the last 40% but meh. I don’t care enough to find out.The love interests were boring. They had wacky nicknames for the main character, like, Mystery Girl. The banter was nonexistent. One character said stuff to another character but it never seemed to matter or deepen the relationship and provide depth to the characters. Mainly it was filler conversation. The whole book felt tropey but in your face tropey and not well done. I don’t mind tropes if they’re done well. We don’t know much about her sister except she bakes when she she’s stressed and had an abusive boyfriend. Nothing about how they got to be so close or why the MC is loyal to her sister.Also, they put someone reaaallllly young in charge of the law firm’s only client. Who does that? YA authors, that’s who. I wanted the MC to be smarter. Cunning and conniving would have been excellent. None of her genius or big brain energy was explained or proven. No way are the main character and her bajillion love interests muttering cryptic shit every two seconds actual, real teenagers. No one aged 13-19 talks like the kids in this book. I don’t care how rich they are, they don’t.All in all, lackluster when it could have been brilliant.
4148791810	“Everything is a game, Avery Grambs.”*contemplates life* *takes a long, deep breath* THIS IS BRILLIANT.FIVE SCHEMING STARS.OMIGOSH I LOVE.think of this book as a cross between a murder mystery and an escape room. *weeps in pure joy that this work of art exists*LE PLOT SUMMARY BEFORE I CRY.Avery Grambs is a scrappy seventeen-year-old who sleeps in her car and whose deadbeat dad is never around to care. Avery didn’t grow up like this. Before her mom’s illness and death, they were inseparable. Solving her mom’s Cookie Game and trying to guess the answer to the I Have A Secret Game (Avery never did solve that one) taught her a love for playing games and decoding riddles. But then her mom died when she was fifteen, and her sweet half-sister Libby became her guardian. Life with Libby is fine (except for Libby’s abusive ex that keeps coming back) but Avery won’t have to live there for much longer. She works hard in class to get into a college and win scholarships, scholarships needed for every single one of these schools. She’s carefully planned and saved for years. She wants to travel the world. She wants to see the places that her and her mom wanted to see together. She wants to live larger than life. But then one day, everything changes. Tobias Hawthorne I, oil tycoon and billionaire philanthropist, dies. When his will is read, his three most loyal servants receive about half million, his daughters get a hundred thousand together, and his four grandsons get two hundred and fifty thousand each. The person he leaves the rest of his 46.2 billion dollar fortune, estate, and assets to? Avery Kylie Grambs.And no one has any idea why.“Traps upon traps and riddles upon riddles.”Before I properly begin this review, I would like to make a very essential point: y’all would not believe the satisfaction I get from watching a poor girl inherit billions and the rich family get almost nothing. It’s really quite cathartic.First off, the characters. The characters practically deserve five stars all on their own.For a YA heroine, Avery is very, VERY understandable. Sick of stuck-up school authorities? Check. Everything-related-to-college problems? Check. Boys being confusing and complicated? Check. Being actually dumbfounded at suddenly being in possession of a jet? CHECK. Surprisingly, she’s actually pretty down to earth about her sudden ascension to fame and fortune (no humblebragging I kno right). Maybe I’ve read too many stupidly individualistic YA fantasy heroines, but I appreciate how this girl knows she needs help and accepts it without complaining.I was also very impressed with Libby and Avery’s sister dynamic. Usually there’s some sort of sibling fallout or toxic power struggles, but Libby and Avery were protective and sweet and wholesome and SUPPORTIVE (I’ve definitely read too much YA fantasy lol iykyk). In terms of family lineage (which gets ridiculously convoluted the farther you get into the series), Libby’s a few years older, and they share the same deadbeat father.And finally, the famous Hawthorne family. Overall, the moms and aunts and uncles are all unique and really don’t like each other, but they do have one, very important thing in common: hating Avery. Avery, the non-family nobody, who inherited the entire Hawthorne fortune. But we are not here to talk about them. They’re boring. We are here to talk about the four brilliant Hawthorne grandsons.Nate, the Southern nomad.Grayson, the cold and reserved businessman.Jameson, the charismatic puzzle master.Xander, the happy-go-lucky inventor.AHHHH I LOVE THEM. ESPECIALLY YOU DARK COLD ARROGANT KING GRAYSON YOU 😍“It would be best, for the moment, for you to just assume that I know everything.”These brothers are renowned for solving riddles, playing games, and hiding secrets. I loved all four of these boys. They’re whip smart, sarcastic, and secretive. And they’re all hurting. In addition, Grayson and Jameson are both attracted to Avery, and while I normally hate love triangles, this one isn’t actually all that bad (and if anything it’s more drama for me to enjoy ;)also AVERY X GRAYSON FOREVER*cough*The story itself is full of puzzles, riddles, and games. I loved how we started out with so many questions, but every time we got an answer we just ended up with more questions. I also appreciated how Avery’s and the boys’ interpretation of clues made sense (i have very limited brain cells what can i say) and the entire book was chock-full of *chef’s kiss* twists. now I will just exist in a state of perpetual excitement until I can get my hands on the Hawthorne Legacy in September love you all sm and goodbye <3Update 10/20/21:I.

The entire book has so many layers to it, not just getting to know the characters, but also the elements of clues and twists where you just don’t know what to expect 🤯 I couldn’t stop listening to it, even if I found the narrator annoying lol 🎧I definitely recommend this book to anyone that loves a good old mystery, tension, and duh elements of romance ✨𝘐 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸, 𝘐 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘐 𝘢𝘮 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺 𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸 😅 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘐'𝘮 𝘵𝘳𝘺𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘰 𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 𝘶𝘱, 𝘴𝘰 𝘐 𝘢𝘱𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘪𝘻𝘦 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘥𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁⋆.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁⋆.𝗽𝗿𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱｡ꪆৎ ˚⋅ everyone has been saying how good these are.. so *inserts audiobook into rotation*
3480305155	Truth be told, i had never heard of this book or its author before seeing it on Netgalley. The blurb is what got me and thank goodness i requested it because i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The premise is greatly entertaining, so much so that I read this book in pretty much one sitting. An eccentric billionaire dies, and leaves Avery almost his entire fortune. We follow her as she tries to navigate the Hawthorne family and work out why exactly she was bequeathed so much money. I'm really happy with how the book ended, so often authors try to cram an unrealistic plot twist in purely for shock value but the best thing about the reveal here is its simplicity. It feels totally on brand for Tobias Hawthorne and was done really well.

3754320391	"Sometimes,” Jameson Hawthorne said, sounding strangely contemplative, “things that appear very different on the surface are actually exactly the same at their core.” How was this book so good? I didn’t went into it with the highest expectations, although I’ve seen some great reviews from people whose reviews I trust, but I ended up being mindblown. Buddy read this with tmm fam - Krizzie, Demon Lia, Ish, Mashie, Devika and Charmie Bookish detectives buddy read 3This book follows Avery Grams and she finds out that this eccentric old man, Tobias Hawthorne, has left all his fortune to her. But things aren’t that simple. The Hawthornes are pretty mad. One of his grandsons, Grayson think she is a con women that trick his grandfather in giving her all her fortune, but Jameson thinks that she is his grandfather’s last mystery. In the blurb this book is compared to Knives Out and One of Us is Lying and I agree but also disagree. The Knives Out comparison, yeah I could see that through out the book and I really like that movie so I like seeing something similar in book form, although this lacked the humor that movie had (but I’m not mad about that since that wouldn’t have fit the book that well). But the One of Us is Lying, I don’t get it. This book is so so much better than OoUiL and I do not appreciate that comparison.I really liked the plot of this book and the only thing I could think about during the day was that I needed to read more of this as soon as I got home from school. The plot is extremely fast paced and I was never bored. I was invested from page one and I needed answers. And how dare the author end the book like that?! I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER FOR BOOK 2 *cries* this is just painful. I WANT ANSWERS!I loved the characters which was surprising. I always have a hard time connecting with characters in murder mystery books, but in here I just love the so much. Avery “You’re the glass ballerina- or the knife.” Avery was an interesting main character to follow. She is extremely smart and I love seeing her working together with the Hawthornes brothers to solve the mystery as to why she is there. Jameson I just loved him. He is an amazing character and I loved seeing him interacting with Avery, but I also really like seeing him with his family and the relationship he had with them. Grayson Another character I just love. He is more mysterious than Jameson is, mostly because he doesn’t interact as much with Avery as Jameson and also doesn’t trust her as much as his brother. It was interesting seeing the way he was dealing with the whole situation and I want to see mire of him in the next book. and Lia THESE BOYS ARE MINE AND ISH’S DON’T EVEN TRY TO GET THEM AS YOU WON’T SUCCEED MUAHAHAHA Xander I really liked his character, but I’m a bit suspicious about him. Can we really trust him? Nash He is one of the only characters, I didn’t like. I just don’t trust him. There’s just something extremely suspicious about him and I cannot put my finger on what. I really loved the mystery in this book. The were so many things happening and foreshadowing and I just love how the author managed to write it. There was something that happened in the end that I expected. It was hinted so much through out the book, that it was just inevitable. The ending reveal felt a bit underwhelming. Not much, but I just found it very strange and I was like Really? That’s it? There’s really nothing more? I’m hoping that we will have some maybe more plot twists regarding this reveal in the Hawthorne Legacy. This was an amazing mystery book and if you are just getting into this genre I highly recommend you give this a try. But regardless of that, I still recommend you pick it up as it’s an excellent book. “Look around at this place,” I said. “My life is escapism at the moment.”
4180120885	My mind is blown by all the things that happened in the last hundred pages.I mean, what the hell?!Sometimes boring, other times fascinating, one thing is sure in The Inheritance Games: the slowness could kill someone.Riddles and mysteries are cool until you're a very curious person - like me - and the urge to give a little pick to the last page is so heavy you'll find yourself at 3 am with the need of a sequel. And with no sleep, of course.But I must warn you: there is no real uncovered mystery in this book. I see it as an introduction to the future: we meet Avery and her sister Libby, the Hawthornes and the dead man with the answers. Patience is not one of my virtues, though.Jennifer Lynn Barnes tells this story with a perfect balance between descriptions and dialogues, questions and answers. The cliches are painfully there, but still not as much as you could ask.In a blink of an eye, the ending comes, bringing just more questions.In a story where everyone is guilty of something, the answer Avery is looking for is not in the near past. But in the immediate future.↠ 4 stars
3519352890	Avery Grambs life has taken a downward turn since her mother died. However, one day she is summoned to a will reading of mega rich Tobias Hawthorne where to her shock she discovers he has left his billions to her, blindsiding the family vultures, the only string attached is that she has to live at Hawthorne House for a year. Not only is this a puzzle of huge magnitude she learns from his Tobias four grandsons (Nash, Grayson, Jameson and Alexander) that he loved riddles and puzzles which are present all over the house but she finds herself in the centre of one huge one. This is a really good YA mystery thriller a Cinderella, rags to extreme riches game. Who to trust? Who are the equivalent of the legendary wicked Stepmother and Ugly Sisters? Is there a Prince amongst the grandsons? I so enjoy trying to unlock the riddles which is like a mansion scale version of a Rubik's Cube. All over the house there are puzzles to solve, secrets to unlock, hidden passages and doorways so it boggles the imagination and it’s almost like a character itself!! I like the characters especially Avery who is clever and she certainly needs to be as she has so much against her and she certainly earns her scones that Alexander feeds her! The brothers are as enigmatic as their grandfathers riddles and how far can she trust them? Although Tobias is not present in bodily form his presence looms and oversees Avery as she tries to unlock mysteries, he’s on every corner, in every brick and within every inch of the huge estate. I love the text and phone banter between Avery and best friend Max which is whip-smart and funny. The book is very clever, it contains hostility, manipulation, there’s danger and threat and tragedy that dogs the family and so has all the essential ingredients of a good mystery. This is a very enjoyable, fun and creative read. It does leave you on a cliffhanger and I’m definitely all in for Book 2! This book should appeal not only to a YA audience but also to older readers like myself. With thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Random House, Children’s UK.
4089235749	Buddy read with my amazing friends Bhavya and Ananya. “Legally,” she said, “the Hawthorne family is required to provide you with keys. Practically speaking…” She narrowed her eyes. “The Hawthorne family is a pain in the ass.”I read a hyped up book again and guess what? I didn't like it that much again. Either my expectations were very high or the book was not that good (highly unlikely). There's one thing I need to ask everyone. Do you all really care about rich people? Like I still don't know who's the richest man in this world is and I really don't wanna know because why should I waste my time reading/watching things about them when they don't even know that we exist? So why do people care so much about Tobias Hawthorne who's not even in the top 10 list? Why do everyone wanna know about why he gave everything to Avery? Guys it's his fucking money. He can do whatever he wants to. People need to learn how to mind their own fucking bussiness.“Hawthorne-born or Hawthorne-made, there’s always something to be played.”This book was entirely based on 💰. We can clearly see how money changes our lives. You know why I hate rich people? Because they can have 5 fricking libraries in their mansions when I have to beg my parents to buy me books since I'm broke as hell. Rich people I'll forgive you if you send some books to my place instead of going to space.I should stop getting jealous from fictional characters. Let's talk about why I don't like this book:REASON 1- Everything that I have said above.REASON 2- The only character I liked in this book was Avery and maybe Jameson a little bit. I don't really give a fuck about other characters. I started shipping Nash and Libby because why not? But then I feel Alisa is a much better person than Nash. Forgive me fans of Nash but I have a problem understanding his character. I really want to like him but it all depends on the next 2 books.I seriously think that the only purpose of Grayson's existence was to make Avery's heart race. And for the love triangle which I have no idea if it even exists. Idk how many of you have watched Vampire Diaries but this book reminded me a lot of VD. REASON 3- The plot wasn't much interesting.I have so many questions but I know I'll have to wait for them to get answered because I totally believe that Tobias Hawthorne won't let anyone have their questions answered. I think everyone who love this book are going to play The Disinheritance Games with me.2.5 stars
4479211719	˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ 4 stars I absolutely enjoyed this book—it was such a fun read! The short chapters. I adored the characters, especially all the brothers. The mystery was captivating, and I found myself completely hooked, eager to unravel every riddle. *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧
4490064317	3.25 🌟don’t hate me for this but if i’m being honest, i do think that this book was a bit overhyped. i did have pretty high expectations for this book so that may be why i had to power through majority of it. the beginning got me hooked and i did really enjoy the ending but i felt like the middle was a bit boring?**SPOILERS BELOW**i didn’t really feel a connection with the characters or any of the romances. the love triangle felt sort of pointless and it might’ve just been me, but where was the chemistry between avery and jameson?? i felt like avery just instantly fell for him and they didn’t have a lot of meaningful interactions beforehand. the same thing could be said for grayson. the banter between any of them was basically non-existent.the whole emily plot also got me really confused. i still have no clue how tobias hawthorne picked avery to be part of this mystery and how he knew emily was going to die on october 18th. as mentioned before, i thought that it was a bit slow throughout the whole middle section of the book and was a bit tempted to dnf it, but the only thing keeping me going was discovering the answer to this whole riddle thing.with that being said, i did love the idea of this book but it could’ve been executed a bit better. the small plot twists also helped keep me interested while reading and most of the puzzles were well thought out. some of the clues did feel very random, though, and i wish they were more related to the mystery. also xander is the best hawthorne sibling and i will stand by that.i could see why others love this book, but i don’t think it was for me. still contemplating whether or not i should continue with the second book but i am interested in finding out more about toby! we’ll see <3”traps upon traps. and riddles upon riddles.”
4269924897	is this just me or did anyone else also read that entire book and still have no idea who the love interest is? like, who is the author trying to make me like more? who does Avery like? i just have no damn clue.
5606373663	Czuję się jak mastermind kiedy to mówię: DOMYŚLIŁAM SIĘ ZAKOŃCZENIA NA POCZĄTKU KSIĄŻKI.Nie całego, ale najważniejszej zagadki. Ta książka była świetna, wierzcie zachwytom.
4258584461	“Everything’s a game, Avery Grambs. The only thing we get to decide in this life is if we play to win.” I did enjoy this book a lot! Especially since the main character and I share a name, I've been yelling at the book more often basically saying, "That is NOT something I would do!!" even though we aren't the same people. It's so odd reading about someone who shares the same name as you, and I veered away from this book because of that, but I picked it up. Also, I feel like I was fine about this book. A lot of people LOVED it, while I feel like it was fine and I won't remember anything about this book and I don't really want to reread it before I start the second book. I don't even remember what happened actually, now that I think about it. Anyways, I can kinda see Avery is getting herself into a bit of a love triangle. I hope she makes the right choice, if she ends up with one. (GRAYSON FOR LIFE)Jameson just gives me bad vibes (don't ask me why, I don't even know) and I just don't like him that much. Cold hearted guys in business suits any day.ANYWAYS, highly enjoyable, and I liked the puzzle/mystery aspect, with all the plot twists, and I liked the majority of the characters. Most of the time.3.5 stars “Sometimes things that appear very different on the surface are actually exactly the same at their core.”

3770912625	** spoiler alert ** wELCOME TO THe awesomeness of The Inheritance Games This Book is frickin' awesome like the gif said!Buddy Read With Raina & Ruby (the first time, re-read was done alone)4 StarsThe Inheritance Games, by Jennifer Lynn Barnes, an amazing under-hyped book, I mean it's hyped, BUT NOT HYPED ENOUGH SO GO READ, AND LOVE IT! (This is a threat! :))) ) No seriously go read it, it's AmAzInG! The PlotThe Book started with a girl named Avery living a normal-ish life with her older sister. Avery met a guy named Grayson in her school who told her that she had to attend his grandfather's funeral in Texas. So she did. Turns out the guy who's funeral she was attending was rich, and apparently he left all his money and his ginormous house to her, but she didn't even know him and nobody knew why he left everything to her and not his daughters or his grandsons. Avery decided to find out with the help of one of the Hawthrone Brothers (The guy's grandson) Jameson. Avery and Jameson did a lot of mystery solving and a lot happened in between like a lot! And in the end things happened though the mystery didn't get solved! (WHICH IS SUPER SAD!, CAUSE NOW I WON'T GET ANSWERS TILL SEPTEMBER I THINK! *SOBS!*)My Thoughts On the PlotI loved this plot, it had soooooo many plot twists! AND all the Plot twists were amazing!, it all went at the right pace and I loved the mystery, but seriously you can't leave an ending like that!, your crushing me Jennifer Lynn Barnes, like seriously stop trying to crush me, I'll die (NOT THAT I MIND! AT ALL!)“Right." Thea dabbed at her lips with her napkin. "No feminism at the dinner table.”The WritingThe writing was very hooking at it should be a mystery novel!, So I really enjoyed it, and it went at the right pace almost always, there was just a few times where it was slow and that was a bit annoying, but then it started going at the right pace again. The CharactersAveryI think she's great! I liked her a lot as the main character! She was strong, and I really liked that about her. Plus she was super nice to like everyone, kinda! She is also very adventurous, and liked solving the mystery which I didn't see where it went though it was cool anyways!JamesonI loved him from the beginning, I also think he cute!, like a lot! not that I don't like Grayson as much 👀! He's so nice and mysterious at times and love that so much! He's also so adventurous, and it's great!, No seriously he's so great *sighs!* GraysonI lovee him, so much!, he's great and really likes Avery!, and it was obvious form the beginning! Also I imagine him super cute!, So that's a plus point! At the beginning, I guess I just didn't like him much, but then I started loving him so much! I'm in love *Squeals!*XanderXander is probably my least favorite Hawthorne brother, I'm not fully sure why right now!, I mean he's super nice, to like everyone, but I guess I'm just not the biggest fan of him. He's the nice character in the book, I don't really like much for reasons unknown. LibbyUmmmmmm.... don't ruin me, but I'm not the biggest fan of Libby, cause she just seemed too nice, and actually I HAVE NO IDEA WHAY I DON'T LIKE HER, but I just don't much. Like Xander....! (why am I so confusing, like seriously) sO YEAH... Libby's not my favorite at all!NashI like him, he's nice! HE'S SO MYSTERIOUS IT'S SO FUN (I know that didn't really make any sense!) Plus he's so cute with Libby! I think there perfect! *Sighs!* *Daydreams in English about them* TheaI want to like her, but she's just annoying! I don't get her!, at all, so technically I shouldn't judge her, but seriously, so far I just find her annoying and I don't get her or her relationship with Rebecca. Makes no sense at all. SadlY i COULDn't find a gif saying she didn't make any sense, so this is close enough cause well technically nothing really ever makes sense to meEmilyI don't really like Emily, she's mean girly as in she's like one of those popular girls who kinda ends up getting what she wants. I find it annoying. AND HE MADE A WEDGE BETWEEN JAMESON AND GRAYSON! 😭😭 I hate that!, (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!, I DON'T WANT TO BE ANOTHER EMILY!, Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!) YOU DO NOT PUT A WEDGE BETWEEN JAMESON AND GRAYSON AND GET AWAY WITH IT!DrakeI frickin' hate him, he's annoying rude, and just a bad person. ALSO HE HIT LIBBY!, LIBBY! WHAT THE HECK IT WRONG WITH HIM? He's stupid and a jerk that totally doesn't deserve a person like Libby! He also tried to kill Avery... 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪 “I wasn't delusional. I wasn't dreaming.I was an heiress.”The Romance“You don't like me much, that's okay. I'm a hyper-competitive, bisexual perfectionist who likes to win and looks like this. I'm no stranger to being hated.”This has nothing to do with the romance in the book, but instead my love!, I have a little crush on Jameson and Grayson, and I AM IN A BIT OF CRISIS BETWEEN, IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY! (I don't want to another Emily, cause I don't even like her :( )“It would be shame," Jameson commented, "if we were related.”Now to the actual romance in the book! Jameson likes Avery, Grayson likes Avery. Avery like Jameson more, than Grayson, (I think she kinda likes Grayson... hmmmm...) Anyways, what do you see? LOVE TRIANGLE! Love TriangleThe love triangle isn't bad, like other books, first of all I don't even know if there is a love triangle but I think there kinda is, and it is totally not bad, it nice!, Though I really do like Avery and Jameson together cause I think there cute, but I think Avery and Grayson would be nice too! I'M IN CONFUSION! Other romances, NASH IS TOTALLY HITTING ON LIBBY AVERY'S SISTER! IT'S SO OBVIOUS AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH! What? I think they'd be super cute if they ever work out *glares* I REALLY want them to be something, Nabby or Lish or Nibby or Libsh or Nashy (I made them ship name(s)!!)The EndingI Hate and Love ending's with cliffhangers! There so annoying cause I hate to read the next book, and in this case THE NEXT NEXT BOOK ISN'T OUT! ahhhhh! The good thing about cliffhanger ending is that, IT MAKES ME WANT TO READ the next book desperately, BUT AS FOR RIGHT NOW, NOT A GOOD THING! 😭😭😭 Otherwise the ending was great!, it closed the first book, but made room for the next book, so that was good!“Toby,” I managed. “I know him.”“You what?” Jameson walked toward me. Beside me, Nan went very still.“I used to play chess with him in the park,” I said. “Every morning.”Harry.This is one of the last lines on the last chapter of the book before the epilogue, HOW DO YOU WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK OF THIS WHEN IT ENDED LIKE THIS?This will probably end up being true, cause if you don't already know, I die of new causes everyday!, It's wonderful just ask everyone who knows me on GR!Rating ExplanationI rated it 4 stars, because there were points in time in the book, when I guess I really just didn't enjoy it much, but I mean all books have flaws, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I might've in some other books. BUT I LOVED MOST OF THE CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK, I mean if I liked all the characters in the book, the book wouldn't really have been that good, but the majority of the characters were great! AND I LOVED THE MYSTERY THOUGH IN THIS BOOK THEY DIDN'T REALLY SOLVE THE MYSTERY AS MUCH AS I'D HOPED FOR, but a lot of other great things happened so it worked out!OverallThis book was great, since when I started it, I had no idea what this book was gonna be about probably since I didn't read what this book was gonna be about. So it was good! I defiantly recommend you read this, it's amazing (YOU BETTER READ THIS! 🔪🔪🔪🔪👀 If you have not!)Reactions!When Grayson told Avery he killed EmilyWhen Avery and Jameson KissedThe EndingWhen I found out Drake Hit Avery!-----------------When I first picked it up, I had no idea what this was gonna be about! BUT IT WAS SOO GOOD!Awesome & Amazing!THIS HAD SO MANY PLOT TWISTS!I NEED THE SECOND BOOK!RTC!
6289708655	4.5 stars rounded up! the riddles made me feel like i was apart of the book they truly didn’t disappoint and it’s SO fast paced which i loveee
4841919536	Jennifer really had me in the beginning. The first 25-30% was going great. Short chapters: love it. Interesting premise: love it. Easy to read writing: love it. Now I figured it would take a moment to get to know the characters and make my decision on if I liked them or not but it never came for the main character. She was just there, didn’t hate her, didn’t love her. Some of the dudes were so annoying. I didn’t want a romance subplot. The clues to this game started getting dumb and the ending? GIRL BYE! I’m through
5730323967	3,5⭐️ "We aren't normal. This place isn't normal, and you're not a player, kid. You're the glass ballerina—or the knife." Hi everyone and welcome back!! I'm starting by saying why I gave it 3,5 stars. Basically, this book was a good one, it kept me entertained and all. And it could’ve been 4 stars if it wasn’t lacking something, like romance... Also I've read worse books than this and I've given them 3 stars, so I think it’s not fair to this book, hence the 3,5.About the plot:This story is about Avery Grambs, a simple teenager who lives a normal life which one day changes completely when Tobias Hawthorne—a billionaire— dies and leaves her his entire fortune. She moves into the Hawthorne mansion which is not a simple house but has as many secret passages as Tobias’ secrets. She’s forced to live with the Hawthorne family which also includes the four brothers/grandsons. Grayson is convinced she’s a con woman, while Jameson sees her like the last game their grandpa gave them to play and the last enigma they have to solve. Avery has to play in order to survive. My thoughts:As I said before, this book entertained me and the story itself was interesting. The chapters are very short and I love short chapters but these are a little too much..? The pace is kinda fast and the writing keeps you focused since the author piles up plot twist after plot twist. The characters are complicated in a way, and predictable in another one. They clearly have issues… Avery is a lovely girl, and i really liked her but istg i don’t understand who tf is the love interest in this series? I’d loved to see more romance but someone once told me the second book of the series is the one with the real romance, and I'm glad bc no romance, no Giulia. I really struggle with books that don’t have a love story. That’s another reason why I didn't give it the 4 stars. It lacks the tension, passion and all the flirting things that would have made this book absolute perfection. Someone also told me there is a love triangle, well… if I didn’t know, I wouldn't even think about it. The only love triangle which is actually in the book is with a freaking ghost (iykyk)... But if you ask me which one is my fav brother, the answer is easy: Grayson. Could I have chosen Jameson? Nah. He reminds me about Jeremiah from TSITP and it gives me the ick. I can’t choose Nash because I feel like he’s like a third cousin or something like that. But I really like Xander, he is playful and kinda funny, even tho I’m sensing he’s hiding something. Well, everyone is hiding something since everyone in that house is enigmatic and full of secrets. But no, Xander couldn’t be my first choice even if he tried. Also, I loved the game and all the puzzles and enigmatic stuff within the story. I love mystery bc it keeps my brain in function and this book def made my brain work for its life! I also have a fishy memory and I appreciated the fact that the author kept repeating the clues because I didn’t lose precious time trying to remember all the small things. I honestly can’t wait to read The Hawthorne Legacy and see where the story goes, hoping there will be more Grayson and def a love story bc I need it like my next breath. Quotes:“Power was as much a fact of life for this guy as gravity. The world bent to the will of Grayson Hawthorne. What money couldn't buy him, those eyes probably did.”"Everything's a game, Avery Grambs. The only thing we get to decide in this life is if we play to win."“I wondered if they'd always been like oil and water, if Grayson had always taken himself too seriously, if Jameson had always made a game of taking nothing seriously at all.”“We could have been reading meaning where there was none, like people trying to intuit the future in the shape of clouds.”“There was something intense in those words, in the expression on his face—like the boy who'd learned to see the world saw me.”“How real, how vulnerable, can you seem without letting yourself actually be vulnerable at all?"Do I recommend it? Yes.well it’s finally time for me to read this book… let’s see👀👀

HOWEVER, it didn’t hit as hard as I remember it doing, and because past audrey believed in handing out 5 stars like CANDY, this reread constituted a drop from a 5 star rating to a 4 star rating. This is also a point about the overall series, BUT this reread made me realize I definitely wish that this series had just been a duology (we didn’t need The Final Gambit, or any of the spin-offs…) ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒✧˚.🎀༘⋆ writing styleLowk, the way JLB writes makes me feel so dumb. Like, if you want a book that’s going to make you feel stupid, read this one. You think you're smart? Psych! Try again (at least, that’s how this book is going to feel). I probably couldn’t even solve the key puzzle, let alone that riddle at the end. Like bro I don’t even know how red acetate works. ♡₊˚ 🦢・₊ ♪ ✧ plotIf I tried to explain the plot of this book I’d probably make a lot of people really sad and disappointed in me, so I’m not going to. However, this book has probably one of the most intricate, complicated plots I have ever read about. It is literally wild to me how JLB could come up with something like this. I mean, of course you have the ‘Avery inherits $46.2 billion and has to live in Hawthorne house with Grayson and Jameson’ plot. But it’s not just that. It’s Thea, it’s someone *cough cough skye* trying to kill Avery, it’s the ‘why did Tobias Hawthorne leave her the inheritance’, it’s the Jameson vs Grayson in the competition for Avery’s heart (ok that last bit isn’t actually that dramatic, but you get the idea). ˚ ༘♡ ⋆｡˚ ꕥ plot twistsSo, the most obvious thing that I tell people to watch out for when reading this book is that you DO NOT KNOW what’s going to happen. There is no guessing the way it’s going to go. If you think you’ve figured out the plot twist, you haven’t - or maybe you have, but you’ve only figured out one of them. I promise, you haven’t realized it all. Even rereading this, I forgot most of the plot twists - it’s literally wild.✧˖*°࿐ world buildingWe all think we know the world of the uber–rich, don’t we? I’m not sure about JLB’s financial status, but this book shows us that we DON’T know much about that world if we aren’t part of, and I LOVE that about this book.˖◛⁺⑅♡main romance♡⑅⁺◛˖So, I apologize to all you gravery shippers, but I just…no. And I’ll elaborate on why I don’t like Grayson later but I think that the way he treats Avery at the beginning of the book would flow into the rest of their relationship if they were to get together and I do not think that that would be healthy for either of them, especially Avery. On the other hand, in this book Jameson makes me angry. He really is a child in this book, and while he grows in the series, I’m glad their relationship wasn’t solidified in THIS BOOK because I don’t think it would have lasted. ୭ 🧷 ✧ ˚. ᵎᵎ 🎀 friendships/other relationshipsSo, here’s my thing. I think that really, there isn’t much fleshed out in this book that can be talked about. However, there are definitely a few things.Xander and Avery’s friendship. Their friendship has the possibility of being one of the most wholesome friendships in all of literature. You can fight me on this, I don't care. Go argue with the wall.Libby and Avery. The bond between sisters never fades, really. No matter what happens, it never truly goes away. Libby and Nash. The ship of all ships in this series (yes, more than jameson x avery or avery x grayson.➶-͙˚ ༘✶ charactersMain Character 「 ✦ Avery Gramps ✦ 」╰┈➤ ❝a very risky gamble❞·˚ ༘₊·꒰➳: ̗̀➛relatability?[■■■□□□□□□□] 30% So, I love Avery. She’s literally such a genius and amazing. However, she’s, how do I put this…hardened by the world. And a little rough on the edges in a way that I do not see myself as. ·˚ ༘₊·꒰➳: ̗̀➛how much i liked them8/10I love her so much! It’s hard to explain BUT she is so…enigmatic is not the word but I can’t think of anything else right now.Side Characters「 ✦ Jameson, Grayson, Xander, Libby, Skye ✦ 」➳ Jameson: Jameson…is a truly enigmatic character. My main problem with him is: he is a child in so many aspects, sometimes more than Xander, but I do like that he always plays. It doesn’t matter what the game is, or if he really is ready to give up, he’ll always play, even if he needs a little push. ➳ Grayson: I’m sorry not sorry to the people who love Grayson. However, I…I hate him with a burning passion. I’m sorry, but it had to be said. He’s so controlling, and too mature, and ughhh he just makes me SO. ANGRY. It’s literally not okay how much he makes me angry.**when I say too mature I mean mature to the point that he's stiff and not any fun➳ Xander: Xander is my favorite character in this entire series like I shit you not he is the best. He's so funny yet can be so serious, and while we don't see it, he is broken too. He reminds me so much of Leo Valdez, who I also love, and honestly is just one of my comfort characters. He's not who I ship with Avery, but he's who I ship with myself, he's my favorite Hawthorne brother, and nothing will be changing that as far as I can tell. ➳ Libby: I really hope you don’t need any explanation for this because if I have to do that I might combust.➳ Skye: PLS woman go die in a whole i beg of you.🪼⋆.ೃ࿔*:･ casting➳ Avery: Ashley LaMarca➳ Jameson: Louis Partridge➳ Grayson: Damian Hardung➳ Xander: Jordan Fisher➳ Libby: Florence Pugh˙✧˖°📷 ༘ ⋆｡˚ other inclusions(🎁 who was your least favorite character? Why?) I'm about to break the hearts of every Grayson lover of the world, but...UGH HE MAKES ME SO ANGRY IM SORRY. it's a toss up between him and Thea because FOR THE LOVE OF GOD BRO WHY CANT U JUST SHUT UR TRAP. He's so controlling and such an asshole to Avery and I just-I cannot. I get that he's broken but like bro PLEASE. anyways that's my rant about Grayson Hawthorne :) (🎁 if you had to choose a holiday song to base a short story around, what would it be? Why?) Probably 'Santa Tell Me' by Ariana Grande. I feel like Avery + Jameson fit this bill perfectly (at least in this book, definitely not after 'The Hawthorne Legacy'). Avery definitely has trust issues (although they're a bit hard to see in this book) and Jameson is so freaking flighty (as we can clearly see), so I feel like that song would be absolutely PERFECT. (🎁 if you could choose any winter holiday for a novella to be centered around, what would it be? Why?) Normally for these things I say Christmas, but I feel like, seeing as this is THE INHERITANCE GAMES, it seems only fitting that a holiday novella would take place at New Year's. The 4 hawthorne brothers, Avery, and Libby, are all SO enigmatic (along with Thea and Rebecca but we don't talk about them) and it would be so interesting to see them all in the same room celebrating a holiday (probably at some function that Alisa arranged lol) (🎁 what character would you most like to build a snowman with? Why?) XANDERRR! First of all: bro is a literal genius. He could probably find a way to make the most beautiful snowman with minimal effort and low amounts of being outside in the cold. Plus: he is the BEST CHARACTER. easy to get along with, fun to be around...well, if you get it, you get it, and if you don't, you don't. simple as that.‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾ favoritesˋ°•*⁀➷ favorite character ·˚ ༘₊·꒰➳: ̗̀➛ Xanderˋ°•*⁀➷favorite scenes ·˚ ༘₊·꒰➳: ̗̀➛ all of them :)✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ final thoughtsI really wish I hadn’t had to lower my rating for this book, but I did.

3900190065	It’s a fun book, I’ll give it that. However, the characters have no depth to them at all. My most hated trope (love triangle 🤮) makes an appearance here. The plot was interesting, but the ending was a bit anticlimactic. A fun, super quick read.Solid 3 stars
3998673670	Hey Beach!IT IS OFFICIAL I AM APART OF THIS FANDOM AND I HAVE FINALLY (after many many minutes of consideration) DECIDED I AM TEAM JAMESON ✨🦋💕For Avery. I am team Greyson for myself of course. How could one not want him for myself? He is charming, quiet and intellectual and whenever he spoke I was giggling, blushing and kicking my feet 🤭I will admit that Jameson was so charming and he and Avery had AMAZING chemistry. I also may be bias because we got CRUMBS of averygreyson 😭. There were literally no scenes of them together which is CRIMINAL but i also get it because of this whole business with Emily but we will get to that Beach later 🙄So let's actually get to business. I'm sure all you team Jameson are overjoyed to have another join your ranks and team Greyson and disappointed to not gain one. Team Jameson for Avery We got SO MUCH JamesonAvery content in this book, they were doing all the puzzles together (until he blew his lid 🙄🙄) and he was not as guarded and cautious as Greyson so he was more open and this man had so much charisma (think Jack Harlow that man oozes charisma). Honestly him calling her heiress🦋✨ >>> I will admit that was good i do love when book men call their love interest nicknames. Mystery Girl was NOT a good nickname and i will die on this hill 🧍‍♀️ALSO THE BATHROOM SCENE???? “It’s ok heiress, I’ve got you “ (view spoiler)[while cleaning the blood off her face, it was so tender and sweet. AND WHEN HE COVERED HER BODY WITH HIS. ICONIC AMAZING BEAUTIFUL (hide spoiler)] Him coming out of the fireplace made me laugh (and i will admit i do love dark messy hair but not as much as Greysons personality. SEE PEOPLE personality DOES MATTER) Team Greyson for me Okay like I said we got crumbs of GreysonAvery which again is CRIMINAL because i wanna see my bby Greyson as much as I can, it also may be why I don’t ship him with her because we hardly saw any of them together but when we did Greyson SHINED. He's such a sweet soul that doees’nt want to be hurt again and I respect it.He's such a pompous 25 year old business man but I love him for it:He calls Drake a gentleman: “If the gentleman so much as tries to lay a finger on her, I assure you my brother would take pleasure in removing that finger” When Drake is decidedly not one. He is so british I love it“You most decidedly are not” - such a weird way to say it😭i love him sm“I won’t let anyone hurt you ever again, you have my word” HE'S SO SWEET ARGH I LOVE HIM <33“Will you show me where you’re hurt?” *screams*HE'S SO AARON WARNER CODED HOW DO YOU NOT SEE IT??Adding to my dislike of Jameson for me, Greyson would never recklessly drive a car at 200mph (for my kph girlies like me, that is 321kmph which is flecking FAST like omg fastest i’ve gone is 110 and that was fast enough for me. You can tell I'm an adrenaline junkie aye) as my old driving instructor would say ‘keep an eye out for the idiots behind you’ and Mr Jameson Hawthorne is definitely the idiot behind me. And that is a bonus for me because I would MUCH rather stay at home in front of the fire with a book and my cat which I'm sure Mr Greyson Hawthorne would appreciate. Now onto the other two Hawthore brothers XANDER HAWTHORNE MY LOVE <333. He was such a free spirit with his addiction to blueberry scones (in an English accent, sCOnEs) he's also my typa guy: a fast talker. I LOVE fast talkers that ramble on about stuff they love <3 mwah! Him and Avery together were such a good combo too. honestly he may be my #1 I just love him sm STAR OF THE BOOK. You all are blind to the best Hawthorne brother. Nash Hwathorne although 🤮I hate that man with my whole being. Such a saviour complex is so yucky. Just gave me the ick. Him sleeping in Libbys room was meh we didnt get much context but he honestly gives me such bad vibes even though I KNOW he's gonna get with Libby 🙄I hope he goes to elf! Thea on the other hand I am on the fence because one line she said stood out to me: “If I was a boy I would be driven” WHICH SHE IS SO RIGHT FOR. But her whole business with Emily and just digging up the dirt made me hate her. Emily, that BEACH she really got on my nerves I just feel angery thinking about her I want to fight her and SHES DIDNT EVEN MAKE AN APPERANCE THE WHOLE BOOK (view spoiler)[ just the way she played with the brothers feelings. My bby Greyson DID NOT deserve that. And getting mad over Thea and Rebecca? Get a flipping life and let the wlw live in peace, they deserve it 💕 (hide spoiler)] Gosh these little boys need to get over themselves AND TALK IT OUT. Men and them being unable to talk about their feelings, society needs to stop that from being taboo. She was so unnecessary (i mean maybe she was but i hated her being there) “Its okay to love them both, i did” - Katherine Pierce AKA Emily the beach (view spoiler)[NOT TO HONK MY OWN HORN BUT I JUST WANNA SAY FOR ONE OF THE PUZZLES WITH THERE MIDDLE NAMES THEY SAID IT AND I WAS LIKE OH THEY ARE PLACES THEN TWO HOURS LATER THEY WERE LIKE OH THEY ARE PLACES!! I DONT EVEN LIKE IN NEW BRITAN AND I KNEW THAT *dramatic hair flick* OH I AM SO HONKING MY OWN HORN (hide spoiler)]Overall I enjoyed this a lot! I listened to the 10h audiobook in two days whilst having a life (i know unbelievable) which shows how much I enjoyed it. The puzzles were so fun too! It was like one giant escape room with hundreds of rooms. And with that I will leave you with this: GREYSON DAVENPORT HAWTHORE EVERYONE 🤭🦋✨HIS AESTHETIC IS TO DIE FOR (if you reached this far i hope you understand the use of beach is ironic as the constant use of subsstitutes for cure words were SO ANNOYING)........so this is basically one giant escape room?I FUCKING KNEW HE HAD RELEVANCE I AM SO FUCKING SMART (joke)massive rtc i have so many thoughts my family and notes app have had enough i can tell.......PREDICTION: Grandaddy Hawthorne put Avery in his will because while being dirt poor she still feed Henry by beating him at chess (a logical game that Grandaddy Hawthore probably loved) and so knew would be selfless with the money.I, as an ameture TIG reader am probably wrong but this is my formal prediction as Tobi as her dad to too easyheres to hoping that i actually enjoy this 🍷okay but what team is everyone i need to know whos cool to like and who isnt 🤣atm im team Xander because hes just funny but ik they wont get together and Libby with get with the cowboy YEHAW["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
4076680442	reread 8/27/22:new rating 4.25✨july 31st: I got my little brother to read this book and let me just share his review:“I never read. And I don’t like reading. But this book made me wanna read so I would say 5/5”history has been made, my little brother who never reads unless he’s forced to, actually liked a book. I’m just going to pat myself on the back for this, he also agreed to read the 2nd book
3600513048	Não queria me tornar a pessoa que fica quebrando nota, mas o meu coração diz um 4.25 pra esse
3859056572	Me esperaba algo mucho más enredado y plot twistero, me explico?no sentí ni un solo plot twist en las 374 páginas, se me hizo bastante básico y predecible, el final💀💀💀💀igual estuvo divertido, te lo DEVORAS quite literally. Es un librito entretenido y pochoclero. Aunque esperaba más, me gustó PD: Grayson Hawthorne estampame contra la pared porfa, gracias.
3420339477	This was an okay read. 🫣 I know lots of people rave about the series - and I waited a looooong time to read it- and… 🤷🏼‍♀️ I don’t get the hype… it gave me Pretty Little Liars vibes. And we all know that went on fooooooorrrrrever!! 😝
