4283498535	Coming back to rewrite my review after reading this book several months ago.This book… plot aside, there were some serious issues with representation in this book:- The black side character’s only purpose was to teach the white main character about racism. Black people do not exist to hold white people’s hands and educate us, and this depiction is deplorable to say the least.- While the author is non-binary, I still find the non-binary side character in the book deserving of criticism. The random scene where the character taught the mc about pronouns was so weird to me as a non-binary reader.- I also found the depiction of mental health painfully ironic. The character talks about how women of the past were viewed as crazy, and how mental health played a role in this. Despite this, the mentally ill characters are often viewed poorly in this book. Everyone’s mental health journey is different, but I felt like the issues within the book were not handled as I would’ve wished.My experience with the author:- As I mentioned, I previously reviewed this book before it was published. My review wasn’t exactly kind, I tend to be extremely frank and I won’t apologize for this or attempt to police my tone. - I was sent a finished copy of this book by the publisher, and as requested I posted an image on my Instagram story. Like suggested, I tagged the author. I also included a small piece of text telling my followers that I had a review for the book on my goodreads. I want to make it clear that I would NEVER tag an author in a bad review, and that’s not what I did here. There was nothing even hinting the tone of my review in the story post.- Not long after, I suddenly began to review an alarming amount of negative feedback on my review. Shocked, I then found out the author blocked me (which is fine, I am not upset over this part). But went on to tweet about a poor review that clearly was mine, prompting their fans to find my review.- Critical reviews are a part of being an author, I can understand the frustration that one may of had over criticisms regarding representation (specifically that of one’s own identity). But people are still able to poorly represent their own community, and I won’t apologize for doing so.- An author deciding to comment on bad reviews is so insanely inappropriate. If you can’t handle bad reviews, don’t look at them. It’s not the reviewers responsibility to cater to the feelings of the author.These are all my thoughts for now, I urge you to think critically about the depictions of certain groups within the book. White authors need to do better.
4110198271	They say when you love something, set it free.They should also say that when you love a trope, you force yourself to read everything that anyone has ever mentioned in the same sentence as that thing that you love, bringing suffering and disappointment but also just enough joy to keep you going in a toxic cycle, à la when I love a sweet so much that I eat it for every meal and snack until I hate it and then I remember it a year later and it starts again.Initial reviews say this expression is "way too long" and "very specific" and "also dumb and who cares," but I believe in myself.And also I believe that my ongoing need to read everything anyone calls "dark academia," even as this results in pain and disappointment-spiked illness on my end, is the right thing.Because, again, I believe in myself.This is a book that many people describe as many things. People call it fantasy, even though it doesn't really have any magic in it. People call it YA, even though there's mature content in it. People call it not YA, even though the characters are aggressively teenage and the whole thing has that adolescent je ne sais quoi. People call it a mystery, or a thriller, even though none of the mysteries are solved and no plot event contains even a modicum of the excitement that the word thriller should imply.And people call it dark academia, when it is actually just unpleasant.This book is no fun whatsoever.Why, I imagine - nay, HOPE - you are asking.I hated this book so much that I took notes while I was reading it. This is roughly on par with me declaring war on someone, or stepping on the back of their shoe so they have to awkwardly hop on one foot to fix it, or offering them a pack of fruit snacks when I have already eaten all of the blues and reds.In other words, a rare and irrevocable act of permanent disgust.Let's get into it. (I love to say let's get into it 18 paragraphs into a rant review. Feels like the good ol' days.)A Lesson in Vengeance follows our protagonist Felicity, a girl who is very rich and very pretty but both of those things are like, so beside the point. Yes, she has about every kind of privilege you can imagine, but she's like, tortured, okay? And like, an intellectual? She is returning to the world pretentiousness capital of the world, her former boarding school in New England, which is for all intents and purposes interchangeable with any other except for the fact that it was founded to be a school for witches and a group of friends in the old-time-y nineteenth century was inexplicably murdered one by one in a series of impossible crimes.Pretty major caveat, no?She had to leave said boarding school previously due to the fact that her best friend / clandestine lover died in front of her in a fairly gruesome way. Although the act itself would be gruesome regardless, really. Anyway, she's back and better than ever, by which I mean hallucinating, believing in ghosts, and generally being a rainy day on the parade that is being wealthy in the autumn at school.I'm just saying - if there's a spot up for grabs in the Emily Dickinson building of an elite boarding school, I'm putting my name on the list.Then Ellis arrives. Ellis is the seventeen year old winner of the Pulitzer Prize, who also somehow is a method writer and goes on grand adventures and gets grants and acclaim for what sounds like some YA genre fiction. Only in young adult novels can this situation unfold, and we are all expected to be like, "ah yes, the Pulitzer is often awarded to debuts coming out of teenagers who write like John Green."But whatever. From like day 1 of meeting Ellis our protagonist develops a crush so huge and defining that she starts describing things as "very Ellis" and "incontrovertibly Ellis" and "so wonderfully characteristically romantically classic for this person we just met" and for a character neither of us (Felicity and the reader) know, it sucks bad.Sucks extra, I should say. It's hard to say what the plot of this is, because nothing that anyone does makes sense. This becomes a problem because eventually you are supposed to think some things are confusing, but everything already is.Essentially, Felicity and Ellis team up (and hook up) to discover the truth behind the old-timey murders that I mentioned above. PLEASE do not make my mistake and get excited about this. You get approximately 10% of the information you want, which is just enough to make you think that that sounds like a better idea for a book.But I can't stress enough that there is no real build or climax here, so I'm not sure what we're doing.Sometimes the ending of a book can be a little clue of what was supposed to matter, because you get a Big Reveal, but while we do get a very silly Dramatic Twist, it manages to be irrelevant to every single potential story.It has nothing to do with the historical mystery. It has nothing to do with the fact that Felicity thinks she's being haunted. It has nothing to do with the presence OR the lack of magic, so we spend this whole so-called fantasy kind of unsure if magic is real in it.WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING HERE.On top of that, characters appear and disappear for no reason except diversity, like Ellis' nonbinary sibling and the two POC roommates who serve as the sole source of nonwhiteness and all of the representation minus Ellis' and Felicity's horrible tangled yucky romance, if you can call it that. Finally, this is an annoying book with annoying characters.I will not be speaking further on that claim.Bottom line: I am going to call my experience with this book Suffering For Character Development and move on.But not because there is character development in this book. There is not.-------------------pre-reviewthis is a bunch of weird creepy nonsense. and not in a fun way.review to come / 1.5 stars-------------------currently-reading updateswhen i'm anticipating a book before it even comes out and then i wait 5 months before reading it, that's actually a compliment.-------------------tbr review(chanting) sapphic dark academia. sapphic dark academia. sapphic dark academia. sapphic dark academia
4267593148	I'm not into dark academia, boarding school settings, or atmospheric stories, so note that I'm not the intended audience here. I picked this up to 1) research more YA WLW stories and 2) change up my reading. I surprisingly liked the love interest (maybe the accent in the audiobook got to me, haha) and enjoyed the twist. I wish the book picked up the pace more, as I struggled to be invested in the first half of the story. I also wish there was more drama and flair that would have put me at the edge of my seat; the story is pretty tame despite all the potential for it to go darker and juicier.
3482928592	"Once upon a time I found it so easy to forget the stories about Godwin House and the five Dalloway witches who lived here three hundred years ago, their blood in our dirt, their bones banging from our trees." I feel like all of Goodreads was screaming "sapphic dark academia with murder and witches" at me to read this, which I very happily obliged, but even with keywords as magnificent as those I still found so many other things to fall in love with about this story. This is such a beautifully crafted and hauntingly atmospheric book staring a lesbian main character who is coming back to finally finish her senior year at a very spooky boarding school. She is also living with an immense amount of grief, anxiousness, and psychotic depression.Dalloway School is a very isolated school, and the house that Felicity is going to be sharing with four other girls is even more isolated from the rest of the campus. And even though there are beliefs of witchcraft all over the school, the Godwin House is where five young suspected witches lived before they were murdered 300 years ago. The writing in this is so wildly fresh, and pleasing, and dare I even say the most aesthetic. The word choices and how each sentence is structured feels so very deliberate and it truly made the whole reading experience even better and even more haunting. Truly some of the best words and passages I've read in such a long while and it was truly a treat every single time I picked up this book, while I also seamlessly fell back into the story.There is also a major theme and plot of literature and how these five girls are working on different theses. Felicity's thesis is about misogyny and the portrayal of women in horror literature. Where a new girl named Ellis is working on an entire book, trying to research these murders to help be inspired for her next award winning novel. And because their projects kind of go together (and because they are living in a really creepy house that five women lived before they were murdered) they decide to work together, and Ellis very much wants to prove to Felicity that magic is not real once and for all. I really loved the constant bringing up of mental health in the past and how women who were not understood (even without mental health struggles) were so easily deemed witches and made them pay for it with their lives. I also just loved how we get to see an unreliable narrator talk about lots of unreliable narrators! Again, the writing in this book is just so well structured and it is so impressive all the building layers.But this book also centers around some very heavy and important things, like the importance of taking your prescribed medications, and how scary isolation can be and how it can also make you much more susceptible to be abused without necessarily realizing it easily. And also, how much darker things can turn when those two things are happening to you simultaneously! I just had a really good time reading this, I think it's not only beautiful but it's so very important, and the ending will truly leave you screaming. "...old and rotten tales about missing girls and desolate mountain cliffs, how Felicity Marrow claimed it was an accident, but no one else was there to say for sure." Trigger and Content Warnings: murder, death, gore, violence, grief, loss of a loved one, a lot of blood depiction, rituals, a lot of alcohol consumption (under aged), a lot of smoking, substance abuse, talk of racism, anxiety, anxiety attack, vomiting, self harm (to get blood), talk of suicidal thoughts, actual suicidal thoughts, talk of being institutionalized in past, mention of illness with an elderly family member, lots of mentions of not taking prescribed antidepressants, gaslighting, manipulation, abuse, a situation with sever parental neglect and abandonment, and animal deaths that are pretty dark. in general, this book is very graphic, and have very visceral depictions of struggling with mental health, please use caution!

3182756530	Frankly inject this book into my veins, absolutely one of my lifetime favourites for it gave me the chills that came when reading a book and loving it incandescently, 10/10 will go feral talking about it. 'Dark academia' has become a marketing buzzword over the last few years, and honestly I do believe that it's often liberally applied to books that don't necessarily fulfil the criteria (sorry). Dark academia is more than dusty libraries and elite institutions and blazers and books, and although that forms part of DA, it is only the surface layer. A Lesson in Vengeance is the only book I've read for a while that fully embodies the fundamentals of what makes dark academia dark academia. There's the underlying sense of obsession around people and ideologies, for instance, so clear within ALIV (often missing in other novels called dark academia), and the subliminal homoerotic content evident within dark academia 'staple' novels (i.e. The Secret History, progenitor of it all) is brought to the forefront here and highlighted in the form of a sapphic relationship and two lesbian main characters. And do not get me started on the unreliable narrator - which though isn't a factor exclusive to dark academia, it adds another level of complexity to the fact that you're not supposed to really trust dark academia protagonists. And how can I not mention the fact that Ellis Haley is clearly influenced by Donna Tartt? Those sharp suits, the short black hair, the silver-grey eyes, that charming southern accent? A Pulitzer-winning author? The only thing missing is a pug. I didn't know I needed a love interest based upon Donna Tartt, but evidently I did. Tartt fans will find many references to Tartt and her works in ALIV, and this is something I found rather satisfying. Victoria Lee understands the dark academia genre, and for that, they have my heart. My only issue? I would've loved for it to be twice as long, just so I could sink deeper and deeper into this enthralling novel. Lee's prose here is so sophisticated and delicious to read. (Also, another sex scene beside the one already included, which I imagine will surprise some people - my excuse for wanting more is that these scenes highlight the complexity of Felicity & Ellis' crooked dynamic excellently.) > 5 stars rep: lesbian heroine, lesbian love interest, sapphic relationships, non-binary side character, Black side character.
3297156312	A Lesson in Vengeance is a twisty, atmospheric tale, full of mystery and memory. Victoria Lee has expertly crafted a gothic thriller with twists of literary fiction and horror that is sure to have readers on the edge of their seat.What strikes me most about A Lesson in Vengeance is the atmosphere. It’s vivid and disquieting, full of the occult and a sinister sense of foreboding. Lee has effortlessly combined atmospheric writing with an intense, academic setting to create a dark academia novel for the ages. With elbow patches, thesis topics and poetry readings in the woods at 3am, this novel has taken the cornerstones of dark academia and ran with them. The writing is beautiful and lends itself perfectly to the unsettling, haunting nature of the story.Felicity Morrow was such an interesting character to read from and I thoroughly enjoyed her perspective. Her character also fulfils something I adore reading: unreliable narrators. In the case of A Lesson in Vengeance, this worked perfectly to maximise the spookiness and unsettling nature of the story. The reader is often left uncertain of what’s real and what’s not, as Felicity’s own mind works against her. I also adored her character arc and development throughout the novel, resulting in a really satisfying, if unexpected, ending.The novel’s intensity, of both characters and plot, served to keep me glued to my kindle until I finished it. Although this is definitely a slow burn, it was effortlessly engaging right from the first page, only growing more and more addicting as the story progressed. The side characters were all interesting and I enjoyed Felicity’s interactions with them but Ellis stole the show. The build up of their relationship and the sheer intensity of everything they did was phenomenal and I never knew where Lee would take me next. The background of the Dalloway Five and the way it was so cleverly woven with the present had me spellbound.A Lesson in Vengeance is dark and mysterious, equal parts intense and haunting. It is a tale to read if you want to have your mind thoroughly blown through clever writing and characters. I cannot recommend this book enough if you fancy some lesbianism alongside your dark academia and murder mysteries.I also talk about books here: youtube | instagram | twitter *eARC received in exchange for an honest review via Netgalley*
4166375495	I created a full video review of this book, which you can view here.A quick summary of the review: I enjoyed the reading experience of this one but did find it somewhat lacking - the main point I kept being caught on is that the dark academia vibes felt largely for aesthetics rather than having any kind of atmosphere or tension, which I found highly ironic as there is a conversation about the characters in this book only doing witchy things for the aesthetic. The ending also made this one unbelievable to me, but otherwise it was a fun read and I always enjoy dark academia/witchy vibes, whether for aesthetic or not.
3816843988	YouTube Tiktok Twitter1.5...maybe a 2 on a good dayWho would've thought that a YA dark academia about pretentious rich white girls that drink, smoke and pretend to be in a gothic novel would be so tedious to get through? If you read books just because of their ~vibes~ then this might be for you but I personally had to resort to a 2.20 text to speech narrator to get through this book.This book has a very slow start, the author excels at setting up the atmosphere of the story and making the reader feel like they're right alongside the characters. You get to learn about all the toxic situations that the main character has going on for her and how absolutely messy her life is. During the first half of the book we get to see her trying to stay on the right path but going down a spiral of bad decisions thanks to new girl at school, a write whom she's absolutely infatuated with. I was told the book picks up later on and what people mean by that is that some actual plot starts happening around the 70% which is already too late for the book to truly be something worth reading. The characters were all unlikable and they felt so shallow. Yes we got told all their likes and dislikes and their traumas but also... It feels so empty and fake. I didn't truly care what happened to any of them and if they had all died the story would have still not made an impact on me whatsoever. Of course the 2 girls are the only ones that had any build up to their characters so just imagine if their characters were shallow, the background characters were just names on a page. The relationship was also so... Stale and dissapointing without a hint of excitement.The ending was... An ending, I didn't care.
3664631410	Throw that sanity out the door (you will lose it while reading this one either way) and listen to me carefully: you need this book in your life. NOTE: a criticism this book has gotten is that it misrepresents psychotic depression. I have no idea if the people who are talking about it have any experience with having psychotic depression, but I just want to bring my perspective.I've dealt with psychotic depression from ages twelve to fifteen. It was the darkest time of my life because I thought I was just...wrong. I thought I was crazy and that there was something incredibly wrong with me, especially because I'd never heard of people outside of my psychiatrist talk about it.Seeing Felicity struggle with this made me tear up more than once. It meant so much to me because I've never had representation for this that made me feel quite so...seen. In my opinion, Victoria Lee wrote psychotic depression so close to how I felt that I don't even know where to begin. I just feel so thankful for them writing this.This book healed a part of me. It personally really hurt me seeing people trash this rep, but I'm definitely willing to listen to people who have dealt with psychotic depression! Just hit me up! <3NOTE 2.0: people have brought up that this book has poor POC rep! It's really important that we talk about this and urge authors to do better. now, let's review!!r a t i n g - o v e r v i e w :characters: 5/5!writing: 5/5!vibes: 5/5!plot: 5/5!enjoyment: 5/5!OVERALL: 5/5!representation: lesbian main characters, sapphic relationship, Indian-American, nonbinary and black side characters.trigger/content warnings: death, violence, manipulation and emotional abuse, child neglect (past/offscreen), mental health issues (specifically psychotic depression), substance abuse, suicide references (no actual suicide), references to racist history.Whatever you and I expected from this book…it’s entirely different. While I think the synopsis for this book is amazing, I don’t think it would be possible to capture this story in a few paragraphs. The reason? There’s so much it has to it, from the underlying psychology to the representation and from the vibes to the twists. As you can probably tell, I am in awe of how Victoria Lee wove this story together! It exceeded all my expectations.When I started this book, though, I feared it wouldn’t be as dark and vibey as I had wished. Turns out I just need to trust Victoria Lee because they wrote this book as if you are descending into the darkness. With every page you turn, it gets a bit more mysterious, a bit darker, a bit more complicated and therefore intriguing. It didn’t take long before I was completely drowning in those vibes I wanted.But it’s not all vibes! The characters were a really strong point of this novel because of their complexity and how realistic they felt. Just like the story, there’s so much to the characters and they are just right. Well, not morally (they are far from morally correct, just saying), but right as in realistically. It just makes sense. Their actions, their choices, their everything.I just love it when authors do psychology right. I could analyze this book for ages. "I feel like she creates and unravels me in the same moment, a sentence she writes and and erases and rewrites, a product of her want and imagination. I feel like she invented me." The thing is, this novel is written through Felicity’s point of view in first person and when I started this book, I questioned that choice. Wouldn’t third person add more to the intrigue of the story?No, Alaska, just trust Victoria Lee. They’re a masterful storyteller, don’t ever doubt them.A lesson in vengeance is written in deep POV, if you’d ask me. You don’t just have Felicity as your point of view character, you are in her head. Literally stuck there. Everything you see in the story is through her eyes. Everything she experiences, you experience with her. I felt every single emotion she felt so vividly which was…a lot at times. Somewhere along reading this, you can feel how Felicity loses herself, so so did I.This book deals with psychotic depression in an amazing way, and I can say that from experience. As someone who’d been in a psychotic depression around the age of fourteen, I can honestly say I’ve never felt myself so seen. Victoria Lee captured this experience perfectly, and I just need to share their words here:“[For the readers] who have never seen themselves represented in fiction as complex, nuanced people rather than as caricatured villains. For the girls who are tired of being called “crazy.” (from Victoria Lee's Goodreads). I love them so much… "She saw the black and twisted heart of me. She took my hand and guided me into that darkness. She opened the door, and truth entered, and nothing can undo that now." Now, you’re probably wondering: Alaska, what did you think of the plot? I loved it so much, there was some really good foreshadowing, and I would love to talk about all of it, but the thing is: this is a spoiler-free review. And everything I could say about this includes something I would rather have you find out yourself, so go preorder??? Like…right now???This book was filled with complexity, from its characters to its storyline. It was an absolutely thrilling experience to see everything unravel in front of my eyes, especially since Victoria Lee’s writing really lets you live in the character’s head which makes this reading experience so intense! This is the first time EVER a book I rate gets a 5 out of 5 for every single category (see rating overview).Conclusion: I have nothing but love and appreciation for A lesson in vengeance.b o o k - o v e r v i e w :One-sentence pitch: After a year away, Felicity Morrow returns to her boarding school Dalloway and befriends teen-author Ellis Haley, who’s working on a novel about Dalloway’s history with witchcraft — the very thing Felicity suspects killed her girlfriend the last time she was there.One-sentence review: This book stole my heart and my sanity all at once.Definitely read it if: you want more (dark) sapphic thrillers, or if you like books with lots of underlying psychology and things to analyse.Maybe skip it if: you don’t like the genre or if you think you’d be triggered by the psychotic depression representation.Thank you to the publisher for providing me with this book in exchange for an honest review! This did not affect my opinions in any way.All quotes are from an advance copy and may differ in the final publication.
3691096876	Most of my most anticipated books this year let me down. Idk if it's because I had too high expectations, or they are just not my taste AT ALL, but I am tired. First I gave this one star, because for me one star literally means there was nothing I liked about it, but giving it the same rating as my most hated book of all time (Song of Achilles) seemed unfair. Although the more I think about it, the more I dislike it, so I wouldn't be surprised if I changed the rating again soon. (edit: Yeah, it's a 1 star, sorry.)It started pretty strong, and I was convinced I will like it, but it went downhill very fast. It honestly felt like a feverdream.Let's start with the fact that at the end it was a totally different book than what it was at the beginning. At first it was this spooky, paranormal-like dark academia, and it turned into a not well executed mystery/thriller. Not to mention that the few characters we had were one dimensional and they were almost the same. They were needed for the plot, but didn't have enough personality. Not like the mcs were so much better, but at least I had some idea about who they are.[SPOILER ahead]I came for the sapphics, but I got red flag after red flag and couldn't root for them. Not when the love interest was manipulative and made the mc kill an animal just because. And I mean she wasn't forced, she did it willingly, so after that I hated her, too. I'm sorry, y'all can torture people all you want, but animal cruelty is where I drawn the line.And did I hear it correctly? The mc hid the body of her dead girlfriend after she killed her (by accident)? I could swear I heard it, but it was so random I wouldn't put too much money on that. I told you it felt like a feverdream.But after it happened (if it happened), I had to take a deep breath and convince myself not to dnf it (which I wanted to do more than I could count). There is one thing I despise more than being in the head of someone I hate and that is when the mc takes a 180, and it turns out she had an information this whole time, but I didn't know about it despite being in their head.I thought Victoria Lee wil be an autobuy author for me after this, but thanks, no thanks. I'm out.
4190894127	wow that took me forever to get through and i really wish i dnfed. this was so bad it was so boring. the author was trying sooo hard to make this dark academia and pretentious and it did not work. the story would have been more interesting if it was adult genre, and the characters were unlikable but not in the fun way. the concept is so good but the execution failed in every way
4618795404	2024 second read: 5 stars. Somehow I forgot the twists and why is no one talking about the last line of this book…I think it completely went over my head when I listened to this audiobook originally…DID THAT MEAN WHAT I THINK IT MEANT!!!??? This book is INSANE. Please read it and stick with it because the pay off is fantastic!2022 first read: 5 stars. The vibes are immaculate
5332978413	this was kinda “do revenge” coded if you think about it… anyway i actually enjoyed this book a lot! it was fun and the vibes were perfect. the authors writing was enjoyable and made it so easy to imagine everything. the ending did kinda fall flat for me tho
3182032496	I was lucky enough to read an early copy of this, and (unsurprisingly, since I adored Lee's FEVERWAKE series) it blew me away. This is a contemporary thriller, with very light speculative elements, where FEVERWAKE is of course sci-fi, but this shares with FEVERWAKE Lee's tight, deft plotting, intimate and nuanced characterizations, and devastatingly beautiful - yet still propulsive - writing. There are shades of THE SECRET HISTORY here, but ALIV is more than that: it's a disturbing yet sympathetic portrait of a traumatized, mentally ill girl, a razor-toothed romance, and a story of the ghosts we cannot exorcise. It's deeply intellectual, yet very accessible - Lee's prose cuts to the bone. It's a thriller, yes, but it's also a rumination on trauma, psychopathy, class privilege, gender, sexuality, and morality. I would say, ultimately, it's a book about being possessed: whether it's Felicity haunted by ghosts both real and imagined or Ellis driven to extreme lengths by her desire to produce art. It possessed me as a reader, too. By the time the book heads into the third act, I was flipping the pages frantically, carried to its twisty, pulse-racing conclusion. A smart, layered, thought-provoking thriller about female desire and the intimacy of violence.
3933787756	⭐️3.5⭐️I have no idea what my thoughts are.I don’t think I was paying enough attention cause I swear I was so confused. I didn’t read the summary before beginning and usually that makes the experience more fun. But in this case it caused a lot of confusion. I thought this was about witches. Um…kinda. But also not at all. Haha.There are parts I really liked cause it’s so messed up. I was not anticipating that. The characters are messy and seemingly psychotic tbh. Which was fun. But maybe I was misinterpreting. I love sapphic dark academia though. So that elevated the story for sure. This is one I’ll have to reread in the future to get a better grip on my feelings.
3482214296	☆ 4 / 5 ☆ “Maybe it’s alright to love this. Maybe it’s okay to find comfort in the darkness, as long as I don’t let myself take it too far.” A Lesson in Vengeance is an atmospheric dark academia set at the prestigious Dalloway School. Felicity is back there almost one year after the death of her best friend Alex that left her guilt-ridden and made her the talk of the school. She resides in Godwin House where only a few select girls get to live; it’s the most elite house with the darkest and most enticing past of the whole school.The ghosts of the Dalloway Five and the weight of Alex’s absence seem to be following Felicity around and she’s promised herself to put witchcraft behind her in an attempt at a new beginning in this haunting place. However, when she meets Ellis, a peculiar but acclaimed best seller writer, she can’t help but be pulled back into the world of the arcane. Ellis has decided her next novel would revolve around the mysterious deaths of the Dalloway Five, and as a method writer she requires the help and knowledge Felicity has gathered about Godwin for her own thesis. Ellis also seems determined to convince the latter that witchcraft had nothing to do with those deaths and that Alex’s ghost is not haunting her. “Is this what it feels like to be a ghost? To haunt the same halls over and over, waiting for someone to see you, to speak to you, to call for you or send you away again?” In this novel, Victoria Lee blurs the lines of witchcraft and explores its role in history and literature in relation to the demonization of women. Were the Dalloway Five truly dabbling in the dark arts or were they simply victims of their time, seeking too much independence and showcasing too much intelligence in a patriarchal society hellbent on keeping them meek and quiet. This question also weaves itself in the present timeline, challenging Felicity’s claims of being cursed and haunted.Experiencing this story through an unreliable narrator’s perspective also brings forth commentary on the horror and speculative fiction genre and how it portrays mental illness, especially with women. This parallels how witchcraft and womanhood have been linked, and how they’ve both been utilised in misogynistic ends but also as a plot device in genre fiction. A Lesson in Vengeance follows in the genre’s footsteps but seeks to bring more factual and unprejudiced representation. Felicity suffers through psychotic depression and it opens up the door to discuss institutionalisation, medication, and the heredity of mental illness through her experience. “Ellis is something new, and it feels like she creates and unravels me in the same moment, a sentence she writes and erases and rewrites, a product of her wants and imagination. I feel like she invented me. I wonder if she feels the same.” While it is uncertain whether or not Ellis can be trusted, Felicity can’t help being drawn in by her and her unique charisma. The Dalloway Five and the magic of Godwin used to be her obsession, but it seems like Ellis now has her whole attention and that the feeling is reciprocated. We thus follow them as they entangle themselves in darkness and magic, and slowly lose sense of what is real or not.I wish the otherworldliness of witches and ghosts had seeped through this book a little more since Victoria Lee has built an indescribable atmosphere within the walls of the Dalloway School. They imbued this story with some of the most aesthetic writing I’ve ever read, creating a very unique voice for Felicity and making it so hard to put this book down.I so very much loved the Feverwake duology and I can say I was thoroughly impressed by this novel which was leagues away from their previous work. I can’t wait to see them grow even more as an author and consume the range of stories they’ll be publishing in the future.Youtube ☆ TwitterBuddy read with Melanie ♡

4617335372	I absolutely had issues putting this book down!! It was sooo addictive and I couldn’t wait to see what happened!! I usually don’t enjoy unreliable main characters, but I couldn’t help but like Felicity. She is just broken in a way that tugged at my heart strings and drew me in from the first couple of chapters. Hell, I was drawn in from the blurb on the book!! Then Ellis… oh our dear, dear Ellis…The characters are great because, to me, they seemed so real. Like these are clearly girls I went to school with. I enjoyed their differences and thought they had a great dynamic. The thing that just kept me drawn in was that I never knew what was going to happen. Each time I guessed something, it was blown out of the water almost immediately by something crazy happening!! Seriously, the level of craziness in this book is intense!!!Let’s talk for a moment about how well written this is too. The worlds are practically lyrical, they’re put together that well. I love books that have a certain rhythm to them and keep the reader entertained at the same time. I’d have to say that this is the most well written book I’ve read this year thus far. Draws you in and never let’s go, but the voice it’s written in is just perfect. I don’t want to spoil anything about it, but I do want to mention that Ellis is just the best character. I love her oddness from the start. Then she unfolds slowly with all these layers and self and not self. That may not make much sense, but once you read the book, it totally will!! Trust me, she’s an amazingly complex and interesting character. I could read a whole series of Ellis books!!! Throw her in with Felicity and they make an awesome duo of characters. So of course I recommend this one wholeheartedly to those who enjoy a great YA thriller. Part ghost story, part magic, part craziness, part lesbian romance, and all awesomeness. Seriously, what a great book!!!!!
3884903998	You guys don't understand... I'm obsessedI can't form coherent sentences because I happen to only be eloquent when I have to talk shit. But I'm done hating! Today it's love.. I... love today.''Bury my bones deep, that I might feel the flames of Hell-Last words of Margery Lemont, recorded by those present at her burial''This is everything I've ever wanted from dark academia, hell, everything I've ever wanted in a book. This is what I wanted The Secret History to feel like. Victoria Lee gave me everything and managed to give the world a wonderful book with no male characters. From this point I guess you could consider these as light spoilers (light because they're totally out of context) but I have to share my thought process in the form of pictures I've been saving from Twitter from the past years. Me as soon as we were told that E was practising her forgery skillsThe fact that we had an unreliable narrator makes this book even better for me. Maybe that's the main reason I loved it so much. But just remember: take your meds, kiddos! No matter how much you think you don't need to, If you start feeling like you're being haunted by your ex that cannot mean anything good for your sweet pretty brain. Of course, you could just blame it on the witches. To each their own. From now on, you can probably find me sitting on my bed at 3am thinking about Felicity and how I would like to start a formal petition to add her to our ''Good For Her'' canon. I'll write something better and actually helpful to those looking into reading this book later, when my will to live comes back from the grave.
4197233582	This book feels like the author read The Secret History and said “I also want to do that” but while removing all of the essential elements that made it literary and complex. I cannot name a single character whom I liked: not because they were good or bad people but because every single person was so appallingly pretentious in a way that eschewed all irony and barreled into absurdity. The way these supposed 17 years old talked was not only highly unbelievable but also esoteric: the amount of shoehorned literary references means that I was either reaching for google or lost frequently throughout the novel. I did find the story compelling, and as a bi woman I liked the acknowledgement of the existence of toxicity within some f/f relationships, but it wasn’t enough to counterbalance what I didn’t enjoy. More than anything, it really upset me to see going off your meds romanticized to such an extent: even if she’s meant to be an unreliable narrator, the way Felicity describes flushing her pills and demonizes her team of psychologists really thoroughly put me off this novel. Speaking from direct experience I can say it’s not cool or edgy to stop talking your medication without a doctor’s direction: it’s deeply unhealthy and irresponsible and it saddens me to see this attitude endorsed in a novel directed towards teenagers.

I might return with more thoughts later, but for now I'll end with: anyone who complains about Felicity or Ellis being "bad rep" just because they're morally grey, complex, traumatized queer characters with mental health issues can meet me in the pit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Edit: Realized I should touch on content warnings, because A Lesson in Vengeance includes some heavy, difficult topics. I didn't keep track of them as I read because I was so engrossed and will probably miss some, so make sure to check out other reviews if you want to make extra sure you're prepared for everything!

4209448688	One-Sentence Summary: Felicity Morrow returns to the prestigious Dalloway School a year after her girlfriend's death, but finds she's still haunted by Alex's memory and the school's dark history of witchcraft and murder. My Thoughts: I enjoyed the gothic atmosphere, but that's about it. For most of the book, I just didn't get the point. Weak plot, pretentious characters. Had some intriguing twists near the end, but kind of boring overall. Borrowed from the library. [R.I.P. 2021]
4244343537	A LESBIAN DARK ACADEMIA?A MURDER MYSTERY?WONDERFUL CHARACTERS AND A WITCHY CULT?Where were you all my lifethis book was so good. I am in love with this!
4291026495	First things first, I want to clear the air. I absolutely loved this book and this is not a hate review. Straight five stars.So, this story begins from the point of view of a girl who is returning to this private school called Dalloway. She is reattempting her senior year for the second year after taking a break. Apparently she suffered some severe trauma that caused her to almost loose her mind and had to be admitted to a mental institution. Her name is Felicity Morrow. Old money, brilliant girl.It rotates around her settling in her dorm and other characters living in her dorm. She is a strong believer of witchery and has been researching the Dalloway five for her final thesis. Dalloway five were five witches who were murdered on the grounds of present day Dalloway. There is an introduction of Ellis Haley, who is an author and has recently been admitted into Felicity’s dorm. She is presently writing her second novels that is based on the mysterious deaths of the Dalloway five. She wants to approach the deaths from a logical approach instead of witchery. Felicity is convinced otherwise. They eventually develop a sapphic wlw relationship while working on this.The novels then develops into two girls who try to unravel the deaths of these witches that occurred centuries ago. They try to get into the perspectives of them and imagine how it would have unravelled meanwhile slowly discovering Felicity’s fears and trying to heal the traumas she has faced on the side.It’s a beautiful piece of literature. Well written, well developed. Tremendous potential, could have been better in some areas but overall, is probably the best thing I’ve read so far. Could not have asked for more. Honestly.I like how the main characters have the story running but the side characters also have their own push. There is commendable character development for almost all the characters mentioned in the story. It has a private school setting, old money, dark academia, mystery, thriller, plot twists i could not guess, theories and philosophies every once in a while, untrustworthy single main character point of view but in a good way. It is just a very well written, beautiful book that is my new comfort read.Trigger warnings: graphic representations of death, attempted murder, eating disorder, mental illness, parent issues, trust issues, manipulation.Advised reading age 14+
3670789651	Actual Rating: 4.5 starsOooh this went darker than I was expecting! And I loved it. I think this one is going to be a hit. If you're looking for queer dark academia with a twisty plot, you will definitely want to check out A Lesson in Vengeance. Set at an elite, all-girls boarding school founded by a survior of the Salem witch trials, there is a dark, bloody history and a dark present. Felicity Morrow has returned to Dalloway School to finish her senior year after taking time off when her best friend died the year before. All her housemates have graduated and a new crop of girls has moved in. Including a young, bestselling novelist working on her next book. This has all the creepy, dark, haunted vibes you could want. Excessively intellectual teen girls reading high brow literature (I say this in love as I was like this too), witches, rituals, possible ghosts, plenty of sexual tension, and an unreliable narrator. It took me a little while to get fully invested in this and I don't love the way the early part relied so heavily on a dual timeline with flashbacks. I think structurally it could have been done a little differently. Regardless, once I was into it, I was INTO IT and that ending was perfection! Did not expect a YA story to go where this one went. The author took inspiration from The Secret History by Donna Tartt, but with lesbians and it is fabulous. Definitely recommend! I received an advance copy of this book for review via NetGalley. All opinions are my own.Content warnings include: death, gore, rituals, blood, animal death, violence, mental health related episodes, probably others.
3557836011	This was such an incredible ride right through to the bloody, brutal end and I am FLOORED by how wonderfully dark and the lengths it went to. This is the book I will forever picture when I see the words Dark Academia, and future books have a lot to live up to.There were times when the story felt slower, but instead of dragging it just became more atmospheric, using the time to bond Felicity and Ellis closer over dim candlelight, unfinished essays, stories of murdered girls and the disappearance of Felicity's ex girlfriend, Alex, who still haunts her. I trusted correctly that the story was leading me down a path I wouldn't be able to predict, and I as I started to realise that Ellis seemed to be leading Felicity to terrible decisions, the more I started to question her intentions. Both Felicity and Ellis are unpredictable, morally grey characters which elevated the story to near perfection for me.
3731135339	3.5 stars rounded up because of dark academia sapphics.I loved the concept, and the prose (yeah, I'm that person) and the setting but I just wasn't intrigued enough?? Damn, that sounds pretentious af but truth to be told I'm just too lazy to start or finish this - especially after reading reviews.The prologue hooked me in originally but after learning more about the mc and getting an actual glimpse of where the story was leading (and confirming that through reviews) I lost my entire interest,If you like dark mysteries apparently this should be a satisfactory read and I might pick this up one day to actually finish but until then, it shall stay on my 'dnf' shelf.
3260784241	well i liked the fact that theres sapphics! ellis was the only interesting character but shes also a donna tartt insert so i guess thats a given

5611513772	This book is a gripping and layered sapphic dark academia thriller! I mean, if that first sentence doesn’t grip you, then read it again please. Dalloway is a school rooted in bloody, primal witchcraft but is now simply a school for well-off girls. There were 5 mysterious and brutal murders of 5 students within the first ten years of the school being open. These murders became known as the Dalloway Five and have become legend. Felicity is enamored by the Dalloway Five and the darkness and the idea of witchcraft. She is returning for her senior year after taking a year off following the devastating death of her girlfriend Alex. She’s staying in her old room in Godwin House, the most coveted dormitory for being allegedly haunted by the ghosts of the Dalloway Five. She is warned to stay away from the occult, stop researching the Dalloway Five, and just put her nose to the grind and finish school. Some think she murdered Alex with her witchy ways. Ellis Haley, a novelist at the age of 17, arrives at Dalloway for the first time and Felicity is inexplicably drawn to her. Ellis recruits Felicity to help her research the Dalloway Five for her next book that she’s writing. There is something sinister to Ellis and Felicity is drawn in like a moth to a flame. What did I love about this book? Everything! It was so easy to get sucked into the dark atmosphere, the whiskey drinking and poetry reading, the arcane rituals, the unadulterated depiction of mental illness, the sexual tension between the girls, the witchcraft… Ugh, I could go on! I can smell the forest and blood and cigarettes and paper. Underneath this tantalizingly dark tale, we deal with real life things too, like grief, sexuality, mental disorders, class privilege, and obsession. If you have an affinity for dark academia, thought-provoking novels, LGBTQ representation, witchcraft—or all of the above—I highly recommend you read this! Maybe wait until fall, I feel like a chilly night with crisp autumn air and an outdoor fire would do wonders for this book.
3707495978	this book is marketed as sapphic + dark academia + witches but it unfortunately fails to follow through on any of them. - sapphic: i'm sorry to say, but this love story was non-existent. i never really felt a connection between ellis and felicity, but it felt more so like felicity was projecting her grief on ellis. there is like one scene that confirms their 'romance' but then the tide of the story shifts letting any chance of future romantic progressions go out the window. this book is marketed very much as sapphic! so make it sapphic! - dark academia: i feel like authors need to realize that just because your story is set in a rich white boarding school it doesn't make it dark academia. it is even less so a dark academia story when it makes no contributions to the story and reads simply for an aesthetic then actually bringing atmospheric tension and depth to your story (which is especially ironic since the story touches on how the students only believe in the witch stuff for the aesthetic-- maybe this was intentional but that's a huge maybe) - witches : this was so disappointing! there are like no witches in this book! it's basically everyone in the book telling the mc that she is insane and that witches are stupid and don't exist! i wanted secret coven witch rituals! we got fake coven witch rituals to prove that actual witch rituals are hocus pocus and preppy teenage girls doing fake coven witch rituals so they can fall in love with some demon prince! LIKE WHAT?! this story was more about a murder gone wrong, some gaslighting, and like no plot progression until the last 40 pages where i just became overwhelmingly confused and i still don't know what ellis's motives were by the end of the story. i hate it here.

The suspense and reveal were so good! I also love that these weird queer teens are terrible and that they believe themselves to be righteous. The best kind of morally gray and messy characters.Felicity Morrow (18, lesbian) isn’t a reliable narrator. She couldn’t keep her own memory of Alex’s death straight. Was there magic involved? Was there no magic? The book kept me guessing as novelist Ellis Haley (17) tries to prove that everything has a non-magical explanation, all the while gathering inspiration for her next novel. The twisted plot took me off guard and I love the creepy vibes and how the past kept haunting Felicity even in the epilogue.There were side Black and brown characters who were rather two-dimensional that felt like they were serving as diversity points. I’m glad they didn’t die at the end of the book though. One notable side character is Ellis’ sibling Quinn, who is older and perhaps just as eccentric.I had high hopes for The Lesson in Vengeance, and I’m happy to say that it was indeed a satisfying read.content warnings: suicidal thoughts, loss (grief), alcohol (underage), smoking (underage), body horror, gore, ritualistic self harm, blood, deaths (including accidental & murders), mentions of attempted suicide, stopping mental health medications against doctor’s orders, suffocation/strangulation, gun, shooting, death of animals, child abuse, hallucination, drowning, mention of transphobia, racism, classism
3224054552	Hello, new dark academia read! The unsettling cover and the sinister title had me initially hooked and all that awaited beyond them proved to be as delightfully eerie as anticipated.Dalloway School's history is full of skeletons, some only newly buried, but all have their roots tangled with the Dalloway Five. Legend tells that the five female students, who each died in inventive and inexplicable ways, practised witchcraft and were cursed for their involvement with the dark arts. This has never been proven but the rooms were they boarded, and all those who are privileged enough to now commandeer their space, are treated with the same fear and respect, in almost equal measures. I loved exploring the historical mysteries clinging to the hallowed stone walls of this elite academic institution but I found equal enjoyment in the contemporary disturbances also haunting them. The two worked in tandem to create a dread-infused and continually unsettling read, which intrigued as more secrets were revealed in seemingly every chapter. An absorbing and atmospheric read I had much fun with!I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you to the author, Victoria Lee, and the publisher, Titan Books, for this opportunity.

3961553013	Critically underrated. I'm not a huge mystery person, or honestly even a dark-academic person, but the setting and plot of this book are written so expertly that I ended up loving it anyway. The premise and setting are perfectly creepy, the magical elements are grounded, and the dark academia elements are written incredibly well. You can tell when a dark academia book was written by someone who actually consumes literature, and Victoria Lee clearly does. And finally, I know a lot of people will disagree, but I really loved the (view spoiler)[ dark ending to the story. I thought it wrapped everything up perfectly, in a grim little bow. (hide spoiler)] I know this book didn't meet a lot of people's expectations, but it surpassed mine. To me, this is the perfect gothic thriller.
4284015617	Idk if I'm even gonna write a review. Didn't like.
5109130648	3.5⭐️I liked this one but it was definitely different than I was expecting it to be. It was spookier and scarier than I was anticipating. This was a quick read with easy writing. The characters were really interesting. This was more of a character-driven story than a plot-driven story so the pacing felt a little slow at times but the dynamic characters made up for that. Things were left a bit open-ended for my liking. There were some interesting things brought up throughout the book but I was kid of left wondering that the ultimate point was.
3828748953	What a delightfully dark, spooky, sapphic dark academia story. I absolutely loved the setting — Godwin House, an old dormitory in the mountains with a history of witchcraft. Felicity, the protagonist, returns to Godwin House after the death of her girlfriend. She meets a new girl, Ellis, and gets drawn into Ellis’ research into the Dalloway Five, five girls who died for allegedly being witches. And then, of course, weird things start happening.The atmosphere is fantastic and one of the highlights of the story. There is an ever-present sense of foreboding, and there is so much tension because you can’t really figure out how much of the supernatural stuff is real, and how much is just Felicity’s imagination. There are some excellent discussions of morality, life, death, nature vs nurture, violence, and psychology. I will say that I think the middle part of the book was the weakest; I think the pacing slowed too much, and parts were predictable. But the rest of the book definitely makes up for it. I definitely did not guess how the mystery would be resolved. I also really enjoyed the mystery of the story, and the characters were all super intriguing. You literally can’t trust any of them, and I love that. In particular, Felicity was an unreliable narrator, which meant that sometimes I couldn’t figure out what the truth was. A highly enjoyable read!
4727149843	3'75.Todos los libros tienen su momento oportuno para ser leídos y con esta novela me ha pasado exactamente eso. Su inicio aunque me intrigada, me resultó lento y me costaba concentrarme en la lectura y fue pausarlo durante unos cuantos días, retomarlo y que me encantara. Sobretodo las últimas 200 páginas, lo que viene siendo un poquito más de la mitad del libro.Características que he amado por completo:- Ambientación muy oscura. Nos encontramos ante una novela dark academia y sin duda es de las mejores ambientaciones que haya podido leer. Realmente la autora consigue transmitir ese aura oscuro, en una academia escondida, ubicada entre las montañas, rodeada de bosques. Incluso en muchos momentos llega a generar miedo y tensión (aunque no es una novela de terror, ni mucho menos).- Personajes de los que no te puedes fiar.Últimamente me he dado cuenta de que adoro este tipo de creaciones de personajes, ya que tanto Felicity como Ellis transmiten esa sensación de secretos muy oscuros y gracias a la narración de la autora, no acabas de fiarte de absolutamente nadie. - Dos lesbianas en una academia. Sí a todo. Además, si le añadimos el hecho de dos chicas intentando descubrir la verdad acerca de las muertes de Las Cinco de Dalloway, de la que dicen que eran brujas, son todo lo que necesito en un libro.Si hablamos de lo que menos me ha gustado, ha sido el arranque de la propia historia. Si bien los primeros capítulos son intrigantes, que te animan a seguir leyendo, no sé si fui yo que no estaba en el momento adecuado para leer el libro o la propia historia, pero se me hizo lento y me costaba concentrarme. Sin embargo, como he comentado, al retomarlo fue una maravilla porque prácticamente he devorado la mitad del libro en un día.Aunque es cierto que me esperaba ciertos plot twists de la historia, algunos otros me sorpredieron y mucho. Sobretodo el final en sí, dejándome con muy buen sabor de boca e incluso con miedo por lo oscura que es la novela. ¿La recomiendo? Sí, sin lugar a dudas. De hecho, es perfecta para Halloween. Además, la literatura tiene mucho peso en la historia y eso siempre nos hace feliz a las lectoras.
3652935542	This book literally had the makings of everything I could want: dark academia, spooky vibes, witchy things, sapphic...and yet, it left so much to be desired. The story takes place at a prestigious all girls boarding school (Dalloway), and mainly follows Felicity Morrow (who is repeating her senior year following the death of her girlfriend) and prodigy novelist Ellis Haley (who is starting her first year at Dalloway). Together, they are two of the five girls that live in the coveted Goodwin dorm. One of the biggest issues that I had with this book was the fact that I had to constantly remind myself that these were high schoolers. There was no well-rounded liberal arts curriculum. Instead, the dialogue between the girls was an onslaught of in-depth literary examination about books from authors that I have never heard of. You had girls that rebuffed modern society and instead thrived off vintage fashion, cigarettes, and sipping on bourbon and whiskey. Also, social media was nonexistent for this clique as well. It was so painfully pretentious. When it comes to characters, Felicity and Ellis are the only two characters that get any sort of depth. We see side characters of color as well as a trans character, but they all feel like interchangeable shells because they pop in for a random comment then float back into the ether. I wish that the author spent more time developing the other characters instead of only focusing on Felicity and Ellis. I will say that the author does a really great job of digging into horror elements to create a desolate and spooky vibe at the boarding school. I would've enjoyed this one more of the constant literary references weren't crammed down my throats, and it didn't feel like the side characters were token characters. Thank you to Delacorte Press for providing a review copy. This did not influence my review. All opinions are my own.
3839848231	content warning for violence/murder, some brief animal cruelty4.5 starsfirst things first, this book is a POWERHOUSE. when i heard the pitch - dark academia lesbians - i was automatically invested and then when i picked up the book itself, i was drawn in just by the language and voice. the world-building, the characters, the atmosphere, this book is incredibly well written and i was thoroughly impressed. i think so often, the way you pull off a dark academia book is by getting the aesthetic just right, and this book definitely nailed it. the other key to a good DA book is by writing a mysterious, murder-filled plot and keeping the reader on their toes. and while i think the ending definitely lived up to the hype (which is not easy to do), i did find that some of the plot in the middle left a little to be desired. as with most DA, most of the payoff is in the last 20% of the story. and even though that payoff is definitely well-earned and absolutely lives up to my expectations, i had a difficult time staying invested in the middle of the story. i think a lot of this comes up to personal preference and me just not clicking with the story, but usually when i get invested in a DA book, it's an instantaneous I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS pull, and this book just...doesn't quite have that urgency. towards the end, yes, but from the beginning i couldn't quite tell what mystery we were trying to solve and where the plot was actually going. but then again...that ENDING...at the end of the day, i am still incredibly impressed and i think this is such an important book because there are so few (popular) DA stories that feature lesbians to this extent. more than that, i love victoria's writing style and i will definitely pick up more from them in the future!

3673607645	like a 3.5. the prose has a polished stylistic flair where most ya forgoes style completely, and it serves the ~aesthetic~ very well. a lot of ya f/f romances tend to be sappy and overly sentimental—which is fine, just not what i like to read—so i was pleasantly surprised that the romance here is like. fucky. there’s some strong atmospheric writing, and it comes through the most when the book delves into the five girls who died mysteriously after conducting an occult ritual. when ellis and felicity start recreating the girls’ deaths, the tone shifts into genuine creepiness, and i think the book is at its strongest when it fully commits to it. and even though i’m not super into the whole dark academia schtick, i think this book could have benefited from more of that veneer. the two main characters have all the makings to be dense and interesting, but the book never quite gets there. i didn’t buy into ellis being a 17-year-old pulitzer prize-winning author (lol), nor did i completely grasp her motivations. a lot of the book is spent sketching out how mysterious and alluring she is, but it never comes across as completely authentic because the reader is privy to so little of her actual tangibility. i was on board with felicity’s character until the 85% mark, where suddenly her motivations take an abrupt turn. perhaps it would have been more believable had the buildup to this change been more gradual, but as it stands, the middle stretch of the book doesn’t do enough to propel this change forward. despite my issues, the last fifth of this book is really compelling; this isn’t really a mystery novel, but i was still caught off guard at points. initially i didn’t think i could be impressed by ya with flashy, aesthetically-geared marketing, but i’m pretty happy to have been wrong.
4140671268	I crown this book as THE spooky season book. Full review to come.
4019921316	daaaaaaaaaamn did not expect that
7917591371	I liked this a lot. I didn’t take my normal notes while reading for whatever reason, but it was partly because I was just churning through this book as quickly as I could. Ill take that as an endorsement. This novel wasn’t perfect and there were several things I could probably criticize, however the overall package was so satisfying that I’m not going to. Great mystery, solid characters, a narrator that you are unsure if they are reliable, and a plotline that doesn’t go where you expect it to (kind of?). I enjoyed this novel and now that it’s the next day I am still happy about it. There were a few elements, particularly around the ending, that I wasn’t sure exactly what they were going for and it was left a bit less resolved than I would like. Yet it was still satisfying and I had a good time. I recommend.
4139542838	I enjoyed this book a lot. The atmosphere was top tier. Spooky, creepy, suspenseful just my cup of tea. Dark Academia is quickly becoming favorite of mine and it hasn't disappointed me yet. Felicity is going back to Dalloway School after taking some time away after the death of her girlfriend Alex. On her return she meets Ellis Haley who is a prodigy novelist and a bit eccentric. She has cultivated a following and wants to explore the deaths of the Dalloway Five who were killed in what seems to be occult like methods. Rooted in witchcraft and Secret societies this book was everything I love. Where it lost me was the ending. It just left me feeling flat. Also the characters did not seem like teenagers at all. I kept having to remind myself they were in highschool as a lot of the behavior and mannerisms read older to me. That being said I am glad I read this book and would recommend it as it was a captivating read.
4564450210	Felicity is back at the elite Dalloway School, living in Godwin House which is the most elite house on the grounds (with the darkest history) almost a year to the day after her best friend/lover Alex died in front of her in such a horrific way. Felicity is convinced she’ll leave her witchcraft behind after what happened with Alex, but she finds that impossible to do after a run in with an author, Ellis. Ellis wants to write about the Dalloway Five and the mysterious deaths that surrounded them and Ellis needs Felicity’s knowledge of the school and Alex’s death. What happens next is Felicity and Ellis always trying to stay one step ahead of the other in order to discover the truth about the Dalloway Five. The pacing of this one was on the slow side but it came with a lot of twists in the story to keep you reading because you wanted some of the mysteries to be solved so you can understand the plot and characters better. I’m still not 100% sure what the plot is in this book, but I found it to be an enjoyable read all the same! Want a cute book involving elite schools and witches and LGBTQ rep? Give this book a read! Thank you Titan for sending me a copy in exchange for my review.
4156453629	I……did not like this. It’ll definitely be someone else’s cup of tea, but there was so much about it that ultimately wasn’t for me. I would have probably loved it when I was younger. I think some of the writing was rather nice and the author did a good job conveying a sense of atmosphere and place, but overall the plot, characters, and pacing were at the best the times fine and the worst of times boring.(view spoiler)[Felicity was a very dull protagonist, and the book suffers for us having to be with her the entire time. (I also abhor the use of present tense for books, and I found it very difficult to get past that.) Ellis is a little manic pixie, but in a way where it’s like…..mysterious and literary. But also boring?? She’s so predictable? And so are all the plot twists — they’re seen from a mile away. The pacing was so slow that at one point in the middle I realized I was just bored out of my mind. The book picks up towards the end, but there’s a good chunk of it that’s just shoved full of ghost lore and nothing happens. I also felt like this simultaneously was so much about the Dalloway Five but also not about them at all. Like, there was both too much written about them but also too little. The book followed the same repeating pattern of Felicity hallucinating but not, Ellis manipulating her but not, o no ghosts but not, and it grew tedious. Again, I did not have the patience for this, but maybe I wouldn’t for the Secret History either if I read it for the first time now! But for my personal experience reading this, it was very meh.Oh, I forgot to mention that this book is also pretentious as fuck, and there are whole conversations that are just there to show how clever the author is as they're referencing figures and books and theories that 95% of readers are unfamiliar with. These conversations have nothing to do with the story or the characters, and they are so dull. (hide spoiler)]
3889125495	3/5 stars ⭐⭐⭐ ARC provided by NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review. I'm just going to start this review by saying that, up until the final 20-30%, A Lesson In Vengeance was a solid 4 star read for me. I feel like the ending of this one is going to be polarizing. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me, but I know a lot of you are going to love it! I found the history of the school and The Dalloway Five to be fascinating (in fact- it might have been my favourite part of the novel). The atmosphere and sapphic dark academia vibes were also immaculate.
4217641876	This book was super creepy (I mean maybe most of the population wouldn't think so, but I'm a big mushmellow and everything scares me so keep that in mind)I had a hard time connecting with this book in the beginning, but when I did (around the 30% mark) it definitely held my interest until the end. If you're looking for a dark academia read this would be one I recommend to you. 3.5/4 stars
3686146631	Thank you so much to Delecorte Press and Netgalley for providing an e-arc copy! All thoughts and opinions are still my own!Dark academia at its finest! This dark, ominous read pulled me in and didn't release me until the very last page. I'm completely blown away by Victoria Lee's writing and the witchy atmosphere she created throughout this entire book.The shining star of this novel is definitely its lush, dark atmosphere. This entire book feels feverish and dream-like. This school felt so real - like a haunted boarding school of witches really sits in the Catskills. I was so wrapped up in this world and never knew whether or not paranormal things were actually happening. I also loved how Felicity's thesis so clearly paralleled her actual life. It was honestly genius. The characters in here are eerie and strange and I never trusted a single one of them. But I was completely and utterly fascinated by them throughout the entire book.Victoria Lee did a fantastic job of pacing and timing by sprinkling small reveals throughout the story, keeping me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning. I was frantically flipping through the pages by the end, trying to discover where the was leading (and I was ALWAYS wrong!).If you want a fast paced, gripping dark academia novel that isn't afraid to go there and scare the pants off of you - add this to your TBR! It's definitely on the upper end of YA (this book is DARK). Content warnings: Animal sacrifice, Death, Depression, Paranoia, Hospitalization, Child neglect, PTSD, Murder, Substance abuse
3420295037	3.5/5 StarsI did start reading this book for the Sapphic Stories Bookclub but I did fall behind a bit and only finished it last night (oops!) but I can't help but feeling like I've been let down a little by this book despite how much I loved the start of it.I don't read a lot of dark academia-esque books and the ones I have read I've felt either meh about or just straight up didn't like (I'm looking at you Donna Tartt), but I adore the aesthetic and when it's done well I really do enjoy it. From the beginning of this book you can tell that Victoria Lee has those dark academia vibes down - it was dark and atmospheric, and I loved the addition of practices such as tarot and tea leaf reading. I also loved having a complex, unreliable and morally grey main character and it made for such a great set up. The romance, too, was really good and I enjoyed the slow burn will they won't they. And of course, I have to mention the twists, because there's a particular one near the end that had me audibly gasping!However, despite this, I did feel like the ending built up to something that was going to be amazing but then all of a sudden it was just conveniently over and I was left feeling so disappointed. I was also a bit annoyed at the lack of personality that the side characters had - and I'm definitely not the first to say this - especially since one of them was just there to point out the racism of academia to the white main character. It was disappointing to say the least. Overall, I did enjoy my time reading this and I will check out Victoria's other books but this definitely not gonna make my top books of the year!
4037235055	This book miiiiiight be 5 stars. But, for now, let’s just say it’s 4.5 stars. My goodness, this BOOK. Chilling. Secrets that have secrets. Passion. Hatred. Obsession. This book was damn good. That ending. That fricking ending. If you know, you know. Never could I have seen that ending coming. Truly. I have no words for what my eyes just soaked in and read. This book is basically a gothic, dark academia setting with lesbians that are truly enamored with one another. And trust me, their obsession and grief gets the best of them. And, my goodness, it was enthralling to read the entire time. The writing was also incredible. The metaphors throughout this story, on my word. Some of them were truly breathtaking. I could picture everything and get sucked into this world so easily, it really felt as if I was living among these characters. Like, does Dalloway School actually not exist? No? You mean to tell me this is all made up?So, needless to say this book will live rent free in my mind for awhile. If you’re looking to pick up something that’s going to keep you engaged the entire time, root for these incredibly messed up characters, and possibly make you question how any of this isn’t real, then I present to you A Lesson In Vengeance. And what a lesson indeed.

3987088745	uggghhh so sad that this was a disappointment that i dont even want to go into details. the plot was dumb & the ending was dumber. dark academia vibes were definitely there, however. and i liked the notion of magic not needing to be "magic" for it to be magic. loll like magic is subjective & how you interpret/apply it to your own life. otherwise, this book def should've been called A Lesson in Irony. 🙃
4218294572	This book. It’s dark. It’s witchy. It’s twisted. It’s sapphic. It’s autumnal. It’s academic. It’s perfection. My favourite of the year so far 🖤
3984562347	well this was disappointing rtc
4164343092	3.5 starsI got really caught up in this story. I do not handle actual horror very well, and A Lesson in Vengeance walked this line perfectly; just as creepy and horrifying as I could handle, although there were a few moments near the end that certainly crossed the line. By then, though, I was in too deep. "The question isn't whether magic is real. It's whether I can touch it without being consumed by it." Two specific moments shattered the magic of this story and its hold on me. The first was a little red flag that I let slip because I thought it might be an attempt at a misdirect. (view spoiler)[At 66%, Felicity asks Ellis to come to her room to see the copy of The Secret Garden that she found in her room, believing it to prove that Alex is haunting her. Ellis makes a half-assed excuse about it being the middle of the night and that she'll check it out in the morning. Felicity is terrified; she's shaking and freaking out, and Ellis can't go to her room to check out this book because she's tired? I can't believe Felicity just accepts this and doesn't start to question Ellis and her role in these events. (hide spoiler)] Regardless, I let it pass and kept reading. But the moment I hit 80%, everything clicked into place, ruining the vibe and making the last 20% completely predictable. (view spoiler)["Grave dirt.My mind is full of static, a roaring sound that drowns out all else. I open the book, half expecting to find another wilted hellebore bloom.And there on the title page, in Alex's handwriting, an inscription:I never told you that I love you, but it's true. It was always true.Those words….they're my words, from the letter I wrote Alex a week after she died.The letter that was buried in her empty casket."I wonder... Is it possible the person who wanted to dig up Alex's grave, who knew Felicity had written a letter and put it in the empty casket, who made a big deal about learning how to forge letters might be responsible? Sure, maybe Felicity is haunted by a ghost (I wanted Margery Lemont's spirit to be behind all of this so bad). Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious at this point that it's probably the murder-obsessed person who has been way too nice to a (likely) insane stranger. (hide spoiler)] "Fortunately for me, Quinn takes that moment to step in. 'Mental illness in genre,' they say. 'Are you more interested in accuracy of portrayal? Or the significance thereof?''Mostly how depictions of mental illness are used to build suspense by introducing uncertainty and a sense of mistrust, especially with regard to the narrator's perception of events, and the conflation of magic and madness in female characters.'" Right up until 80%, I loved this book. It made me want to read more classics, get better at talking about literature, and learn more about tarot. I acknowledge that the girls are all a little pretentious, but what else would you expect from an elite boarding school for prominent (read: filthy stinking rich) families? The aesthetic, the witchy vibe, was delicious with covens, secret societies, magic, and ritual - I loved it all. Review originally posted here on Britt's Book Blurbs.

4215649818	** spoiler alert ** For a quick dark-academia book that's gay, this was pretty good!I read this around the most prolific time of the book (3am), and all I could think the whole time was "this would be a really dope movie" so I really hope they sell the rights to this.I liked Felicity a lot, she did a good job of being an unreliable narrator while making sure you root for her the whole time. There's no point where I don't go "I'm on your side queen" because she just seemed like such a visceral character - she throws herself into things and says what she is thinking, and she isn't afraid of what makes people uncomfortable around her, she keeps her chin up always.The way Dalloway simultaneously tries to leash Felicity while having no idea what she's doing ever was simply hilarious and a perfect example of a school "trying" to help. They'd simply ban her from a section of the library and hope she figures her shit out LOL. Perfection. I liked the potential of the other girls as Godwin house but kept hoping for more of them. I understand that wasn't the point at all of this book though, and the consumption of Felicity by Ellis is the point, I just kinda wanted more of a "if we were villains" vibe from the crew. I will simply choose to headcanon things about the girls and make them facts.Spoiler but (view spoiler)[Ellis would be that character in the movie who would get clocked as the villain cause they're the only one without an iphone - just saying. (hide spoiler)]The only problem was there were very limited 'likely' options for the answer to what's going on, and I figured it out almost instantly. Every moment where you're like 'oh wonder what this could mean' was so easily answered by the most likely option, so that did pull some of the fun mystery from things. I did find myself hoping for kind of twist but it played out exactly as I thought it would. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, and I don't penalize books because I guessed what was happening. I just wish more redirects could have happened, would have heightened the tension a little.I really need to read more dark academia books, honestly. It's such a trend on tiktok right now so it's always in my mind, and then I put off reading books like this even though the vibes are immaculate.
3600854735	A Lesson in Vengeance follows Felicity who is returning to Dalloway School, an elite boarding school, the year after her girlfriend died there under mysterious and malevolent circumstances. The school has the legend of the Dalloway Five, girls thought to be witches who all died centuries ago in ritualistic killings and Felicity is haunted by both her own past and the legends of Dalloway school. When Felicity returns she meets Ellis, a writing prodigy who is keen to explore the legend of the Five in order to help her write her next book thrusting both girls into a world of magic, murder and vengeance. I have quite mixed feelings on this book, some elements I really liked including the horror elements which I thought were really well written. I loved Alex and her whole storyline and how Felicity reacted and managed her grief, as well as the ghost elements and Felicity being haunted by the past. (Additionally I way preferred Alex and Felicity's relationship over Felicity and Ellis, I thought the chemistry and care was so much more belivable.) I also really like the mystery/history of the dalloway five - honestly they deserve their own book. However other parts really annoyed me; in particular Ellis - imo the book would have been so much better if her entire storyline had just been cut and just focused on Felicity returning to the school and dealing with her haunted past and the legacy of the Dalloway girls. Additionally the irony of both the mental health conversations and dark academia vibes really frustated me. The main characters talk about one of the societies not caring about actually doing something and just doing it for the aesthetic but the whole book feels like one big dark academia aesthetic rather than feeling authentic - the characters are super pretentious and read like they were in the 18th century when the book took place in modern times (which I also think was a bit of a mistake - this is not the first time I have been burned thinking a sapphic DA was set in historical boarding school only for it to turn out to be modern). Also the Felicity is doing a project on mental illness and unreliable narrators in horror (and I assume on the fact that this is problematic) but then Felicity herself is an unreliable narrator because she has stopped taking her medication??? I don't know if this was a delibrate choice or not but it made me uneasy. I also felt like this book was limited by the fact it was YA, the characters are constantly smoking and drinking (which don't get me started on characters smoking in YA and romanticising it, I would never shame anyone for smoking but please please authors do not make it seem 'cool' - when you have seen patients unable to complete a sentence without getting breathless from COPD due to lifelong smoking I cannot in good conscious support anything that makes smoking seem okay without any mention of the consequences) also the horror elements could have been leaned into a bit more if it had been adult! And I think morally grey/evil characters are much more suited to adult ficition - not saying YA should be sanitised but it just felt like the charcaters were not explored to their full potential, instead of trying to seem like actions were somehow justified if you want to make characters evil just lean into the fact they are pschopaths. I don't think I'm explaining it well but it just felt like the characters would do some really dark things but it was just glossed over and at the same time like you were being told this character is bad more for the aesthetic than anything else. I have been a bit harsh in this review (lol T_T) but overall I did enjoy my reading experience, I was just a bit sad it didn't totally live up to my expectations. I would still reccomend it, especially if you like dark academia (I also have to admit I'm not the worlds biggest dark academia fan - esepcially when everyone studies literature) and creepy vibes.
