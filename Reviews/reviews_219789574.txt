7345925535	The Sunken Town by Karen Nelson explores secrets, destiny and the meaning of family in this page turning thriller. Nelson deftly develops characters who are multidimensional and believable. There is no moralizing, the reader is able to understand the “why” of the choices and secrets. I couldn’t put it down!
7248229390	I loved this book! Couldn’t put it down! Nelson vividly tells the stories of Lindsay and Claire, set both on a Maine college campus in the 90’s and current day in CA and Maine. It is a story about mother/daughter relationships, the complexities of adoption, the idea of nature vs nurture, and the idea of past secrets and how they impact one’s future and identity. Highly recommend for a good book club discussion and can’t wait for my book club to discuss it next month!
7072145365	** spoiler alert ** Alternating points of view across generations, a family mystery, and a love triangle - what’s not to love?? Nelson paints an intriguing, beguiling tale about the depth of mother - daughter relationships and the strength of young love.

7139128446	Given the universal, almost primal, subject matter of mother-daughter stories, there are many of them out there. This one is exceptional. Beautifully written by author Karen Nelson, its story takes the reader into the timelines of two seemingly disparate women who never met ... save for the brief moment of the younger one’s birth. Claire life exists in the past, where she lived as a vibrant, intelligent woman who traverses her difficult circumstances with a certain fierceness and dedication to being fully herself. At a Maine private school after her parents’ unexpected deaths, she slowly gravitates toward “the Royals,” the most elite and coveted group of students who become her friends, lovers, and tormenters. When she finds herself inconveniently pregnant, and it’s clear the father’s upper crust, overpowering family plan to take over the direction of her life from that moment forward, she surreptitiously, and permanently, disappears from the scene by faking her own death, giving up her baby to adoption, and absconding into obscurity.Woven in between Claire’s story we meet Lindsay, who we immediately discern is Claire’s now-grown daughter. Unaware of who her mother is—was—Lindsay is stunned to receive a letter informing her of her biological mother’s death and her subsequent deeding of a large, beautiful property in Maine to her daughter. From there, Lindsay’s life goes into a kind of freefall, where she’s forced to balance conflicting emotions regarding her beloved but sometimes difficult adoptive parents, face the reality of this enormous bequeathment, decide how much of her mother’s past she wants to explore, and find equilibrium within her growing struggle to discern where she fits in all this, where she belongs, who she belong to and with, and how she wants to define her life going forward. Both women are compelling, emotionally engaging, and deeply human characters. I followed their individual stories with empathy and interest and found the page-turning aspects of unfolding events to be both unexpected and expertly crafted, all leading to a meaningful and touching ending. An excellent read by every metric.
7808200791	How many of us get a glimpse of what another life might have been like?A young college-aged woman, Claire, fakes her suicide and disappears to birth a daughter she then gives up for adoption. That same woman, when decades later she dies, leaves her home to her daughter.The adopted child, Lindsay, grows up to be a woman, so well-loved that she is not the least curious about her birth mother. But when she inherits her birth mother’s house, life goes in another direction, she is destined to learn the circumstances of her birth and faced with conflicting destinies.A dual timeline structure, alternating between Maine and California, serves to tell mother’s and daughter’s stories effectively, and they are beautifully braided together with no jarring changes of narrative voice. Believable characters: I especially liked Lauren, Claire's neighbor and friend, who helps Lindsay navigate and digest the experience of discovering the truth of her birth and her mother's life.A well-told story that kept me turning the pages. The sunken town of the title stands in for what is submerged in all our lives that deserves surfacing.
7440530478	** spoiler alert ** I didn’t expect much from this book since I won it on a giveaway, she’s a debut author, and I’ve gotten some duds before. The author had signed the book and I felt like if she put in that extra something it was worth a read. I read the whole book in two days and couldn’t put it down. She dives between both the mother and daughter seamlessly leaving both relatable. It’s a great story and well written. I felt like the ending could’ve had a bit more closure. She didn’t well with the resolve between Lindsey and the other characters she interacted with but I felt like Lindsey’s internal choice on her future was unresolved. I think it could’ve used an epilogue even if it were just her and the dog managing between the two homes and in therapy because she didn’t feel complete yet but she was on the path. This definitely might hit different if you’re closer to adoption in your life. Overall I would definitely recommend giving this a read. And I look forward to more books from this author.
7160269881	The Sunken Town is a wonderful book that drew me in before I had even finished the first chapter. This skillfully composed debut novel by Karen Nelson features relatable and complex characters who face challenges that I’ve never encountered before. Reading this page-tuner, I enjoyed the author’s writing style, especially her ability to create vivid and engaging scenes. As someone who is more inclined to read non-fiction, the accounts of the two main characters are written so realistically that at times I actually forgot that I was reading a novel. I highly recommend this book!
7067848792	I read this book on the edge of my seat. I love the kind of book where the MC doesn't know who she is and has to research and find out. Self-discovery like a detective. Love that! The metaphor of the sunken town in the lake is the mysterious background for this tale of who killed whom, who failed whom, who lied, who told the truth. Flashbacks to the adoptive mother's POV tells the reader more than the MC knows. It's a fascinating balance of knowledge. I enjoyed this book deeply. It's a keeper!
7068543043	A terrific novel about two strong women on opposite sides of the country, each determined to create her own life no matter the obstacles. The first chapter kicks off with an accident and a secret, and I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough. Great writing—not an extra word to be found. I loved it!
7394066155	I struggled between 2 and 3 stars. Went with three. There were just way too many descriptive paragraphs. Lindsay was exhausting. Her rambling thoughts really went nowhere. Not a book I would recommend to my fellow readers
7375409577	I was left floatingFor me, this book was only fair. Because I have worked with foster & adopted youth for years, I continued reading to the end. I was shocked when I turned the page & the book was finished.
7630315259	Book was okay. The parts in the past were boring because we already know everything that happened because it was told in the present. Having the past told as journal entries was ludicrous. No one would keep that detailed of a journal complete with word for word conversations.
7659777841	I really enjoyed The Sunken Town and was swept along with the parallel stories. I understood the generational story line of both characters following the weaving questions within families - mothers - fathers - and daughters- along with East and West Coast communities. This story had me reading way past my bedtime. Congratulations.
7177244392	The novel starts with a bang and pulls you along. A satisfyingly good read!
7367204851	Mehhhh - barely remember what it was about Would not recommend
7067221865	I loved everything about this book and didn't want it to end. It has everything I love: family secrets, mother-daughter relationships, and more. Great writing, too.
7267568366	This is an excellent book. I enjoyed the descriptive style and the settings and characters seemed very familiar to me. The metaphor of the "sunken town" provides a creepy and illuminating background for a tale about what lies beneath the surface of seemingly perfect lives. The Sunken Town is a captivating and highly recommended read.
