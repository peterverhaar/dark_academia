37822929	THIS! This is what happens when you jump into a rebound relationship with both feet.So, when the story opens, Romeo is desperately in love with Rosaline. But since she won't give up that pussy has sworn to remain chaste, he's all depressed and heartbroken. Annoying emo style. His friends, tired of his constant whining, give him a Beyoncé mixtape. He takes her words to heart, and her lyrics begin to mend his broken soul. His boys drag his sad ass to a party, and across a crowded room, Romeo spies his next victim. I mean, his really really for real this time True Love.Meet 13 year old Juliet. Who is 13.And how old is Romeo? Well, he's old enough to kill Juliet's cousin in a sword fight, so...yeah. Probably not 13. But since he's such a punk little pussy - what with the whining, sobbing, and spouting off crap poetry - I'm going to assume he's not much older than she is and say 15 or 16. If I'm wrong, don't correct me. It'll help me sleep tonight. Tragically, Juliet is a Hatfield, and Romeo is a McCoy. Their families have been feuding over a McCoy pig that was killed during a Hatfield moonshine run decades ago. Totally true. I swear.Needless to say, tensions are still running high. So. Shhhhh. They gotta keep their love on the down low.And it is love, dammit! I mean, they've stared at each other a whole bunch and had like two conversations. This time around, Romeo isn't going to make the same mistake as before, and let the new girl of his dreams slip through his fingers.Fuck, yeah! Time to get married!Because marriage will solve all your problems. No, really.Pinkie promise.And we all know what happened next, right?!Well...Ish.You know, I can't help but wonder what that first encounter would've been like if they'd met when they were older?Romeo: Hey baby, Heaven must be missing an angel. Mind if I crawl up to your balcony tonight?Juliet: The fuck?! *taser crackles...Romeo screams*At any rate, this isn't a romance, it's a cautionary tale. And a pretty funny one at that! I originally gave it 3 stars, but I had to bump it up for making me smile as I remembered all the fun I had mistakes as a young woman - without drinking poison! Between Romeo & Juliet both crying, moping, and twirling around like tweenage girls and the rest of the cast flailing around to accommodate these idiots, this was way better than I remembered it.I listened to this on Playaway, so I got to have the audio version with a full cast of characters, sound effects, and music. Loved it! Totally recommend going this way if you're planning on trying out Shakespeare.
169128186	The people who dislike this play are the ones who view common sense over being rational, and prefer to view the world in a structured way. One of the main arguments that come across is the 'meeting, falling in love, and dying all in a weekend when Juliet is but 13'. We all must die in the end, so wouldn't you want to in the name of love than of an awful disease? Perhaps the two lovers weren't truly in love, but their last living moments were spent believing so, so what does it matter? How can one truly know if one is in love? Is it a feeling? In that case, what is a feeling? If you believe you are in love, then you may as well be, contrary to what others might say.The argument with the 'weak' plot; Shakespeare didn't invent Romeo and Juliet. It was infact a poem which is constantly being adapted over time. Shakespeare did add in some aspects but the meeting in the ballroom, Tybalts death, the sleeping draught and such were already in the poem.I personally love this play, purely because it's an escape from this modern world. I'm not saying I like the treatment of women, nor the fighting, but it's like a different world that i'm never going to experience, and reading it through Shakespeare's gorgeous writing makes Verona seem all the more romantic.

1182573	Two things struck me during this re-reading: 1) From the first scene of the play, the sexual puns are drenched in metaphorical violence (drawing your weapon, laying knife aboard, forcing women to the wall, etc.), creating a stark contrast with the purity of Romeo and Juliet's love and language, and 2) Mercutio, the Nurse and Old Capulet are something totally new both in Shakespeare and also in English drama, that is, characters who are not only realistic but whose language completely reflects their thought processes to the point where they take on a life of their own. Shakespeare would create many other such characters, but these three are the first.
1691228809	Why didn’t they just run away together? It would have saved a lot of heart ache.
46908910	Every emo fourteen year old's dream. In bullet-point form:• fall in love with hot boy/girl (delete as appropriate) that parents can't stand; • tender words and some sex - gotta find out what that's like; • major tragic incident that really wasn't your fault, you were provoked; • everyone's mad at you; • die beautiful death in loved one's arms; • parents finally understand how much they cared about you and are sorry they didn't treat you better when you were alive.So how did Shakespeare manage to turn this heap of crap, which even Zac Efron would think twice about, into one of the most moving stories of all time? If you still need proof that he was a genius, look no further.
4951866863	Let us zealously, prance through this amorous love-story, to relish the Shakespearean era!😊 Following, is the abridged plot summary, as per what all I could gather, post the endearing read, pardon and correct me for any of my follies and errors- ##################################### The long-standing brawl between the Capulets and Montagues, the banquet-The Capulets throw a feast, in which Montagues aren’t invited, due to the long-standing feud between the two families. The hero of the play, Romeo Montague, pining over Rosaline, dares to masquerade and gate-crash, the banquet, just to catch a glimpse of his searing-love. But destiny has other plans, Romeo loses his heart to the heiress of the Capulet family, Juliet!Meanwhile in the banquet, Tybalt, nephew to the Lady Capulet, having recognised Romeo, willing to enter into a brawl with him, is dissuaded by Lady Capulet, in order to maintain the decorum of the ball. Juliet has also discovered his identity in the feast, and has been swooned and swept by his charm. Both are head-over-heels for each other by now!The balcony love-scene 😊-Forlorn and lovelorn, resorting to her balcony, Juliet confides her affection for Romeo to the moon and the stars(this famous balcony scene is the most-loved!), unaware, Romeo has heard it all underneath the balcony. Ecstatic, by Juliet’s searing passion, both resolve for a secretive and speedy nuptial the following day. The marriage is brought to pass, in the cell of Friar Laurence, Romeo’s friend.The brawl and gory on the street ☹-On the wedding day, Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo’s friends, are accosted by Tybalt, seeking vengeance from Romeo for trespassing the feast. A contention ensues, Romeo lost in marital-bliss, doesn’t show any interest in the brawl, but Mercutio, all infuriated, takes on Tybalt and is slain! Romeo, now all exasperated, in turn butchers Tybalt. For this act of gory, Romeo is banished by the Prince of Verona. Juliet’s condition ☹-The bride of one night, Juliet, is left sobbing and dishevelled. Unaware of the secret nuptial rites, Juliet’s father, resolves to get her married to the kinsman, Paris.The devastating conspiracy! Devised for the good, but fails miserably ☹-Friar Laurence, devises a secret plot to help the love-birds unite.(the dramatic failure of the plot, leads to the long-lived tragedy!). He suggests Juliet to drink a potion, which will give her semblance to death, on the day of her marriage to Paris. But Alas! Purporting as dead, she is consigned to the tomb by her father mistakenly. Unaware of the plot, Romeo, is all frenzied, frantic, heart-broken, grieved, and rushes to the tomb, having drunk poison, just to lay beside Juliet in the tomb. Upon waking up and discovering, Romeo lying dead beside her, Juliet seizes his dagger, and kills herself.Reconciliation-This double tragedy, reconciles the two families, alas, after all the carnage & gory.Favourite lines from the play-Defining the bad-luck of the two-“A pair of star-cross 'd lovers take their life”Few general ones-To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand“With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew. Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs : But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw”Romeo brooding over the luxury of his sorrow, post which he meets Juliet-" Why, then, O brawling love ! O loving hate ! O anything, of nothing first create ! O heavy lightness ! serious vanity ! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms ! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health ! "……………………"Under love's heavy burden do I sink."……………………."Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty."……………….. "Thus with a kiss I die."………………………..Upon hearing the sweet Juliet’s voice in the garden-How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night. Like softest music to attending ears !Juliet’s expression of love-My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep ; the more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite,………….Good night, good night ! parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow……………………"O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."……………….The Prince of Verona-"For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo." ####################################My views-It is a play with delineation of all sentiments, from a hideous family feud, a personal vendetta turning into bloodshed, to a torrential love story, and a tragedy of mistakes and a failed plan!Both Romeo and Juliet, are subjects of a tumultuous youth, living in a warlike hubbub, living a contrasting life, of passion and despair!Romeo, is a man with good intentions, but all his efforts are forfeited. He is showcased as an epitome of bad-luck/star-crossed. Romeo nurses his love in his heart, and is seen lamenting and foreboding, shedding tears throughout. He isn’t a mature thinker, and is given into hopelessness on every occasion, soon enough!Juliet, is a simpleton, naïve, true to the core, and is given into poetic imaginations of a tender heart. She thinks aloud in words!An ardent, unrestrained, tender, young love, nothing is factitious or fallacious about their sovereign love!I am gob-smacked, how can one write a play with such a purity of heart, dignity of manners, passion in love and violence, in a rhythmic sonnet, in an era, beyond contemplation!! That is what Shakespeare is all about, after all! 😊This delicate tale of love and misfortune, deserves an endearing 5-star!!!!

2907861782	Romeo and Juliet is an enduring tragic love story between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet written by William Shakespeare. It is also a story of the family feud between the Montagues and Capulets and how it affects the romance between Romeo and Juliet. The story is set in Verona and Mantua in Italy.I have more than a dozen friends who love to read works with romance as the central theme. I was surprised to see that most of them haven't read this masterpiece yet. If you are an ardent fan of romance or William Shakespeare, you should never miss the opportunity to read this book.————————————————————————— You can also follow me on Instagram ID - Dasfill | YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill | YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health | YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam | Threads ID - Dasfill | X ID - Dasfill1 | Snapchat ID - Dasfill | Facebook ID - Dasfill | TikTok ID - Dasfill1
347065558	‘in fair verona, where we lay our scene..’ i went to verona this past weekend and there is a very special experience that comes from reading a story in the same place where it is set. the city has a very romantic feel to it, but its a gentle and quiet romance. which is completely different from the urgent and desperate love between romeo and juliet. we could argue for days about whether or not romeo and juliet were actually in love with each other (let alone old enough to know what love is) but, for me, my focus isnt the story. its how its told. the writing in this is so lovely (even when tybalt gets called a saucy boy lololol). i think shakespeare is a genius and the way his characters express love and longing and desire in this is really something else. ‘come, gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night; give me my romeo; and, when i shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night.’ maybe i just fell under the spell of city, or maybe shakespeares words really do have a profound effect on the reader, but i enjoyed this play and these star-crossed lovers. and its true what the prince says, ‘for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo.’↠ 4.5 stars
133726796	In terms of language and style, Romeo and Juliet might possibly be the best of all Shakespeare's work. It's crammed full of some of the most beautiful poetry I've ever had the pleasure of reading. But the story of lust-filled teens sacrificing themselves because of an extreme burst of instalove? Never really been my cup of tea.

717337458	Who does not know the story of Romeo and Juliet? And these immortal lines,"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?""But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.""Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow,That I shall say good night till it be morrow."The very word "Romeo" has become synonymous with "male lover" in English, and the idea of the doomed romantic lovers, whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families, is famous world-wide. It has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical, opera and radio; the latest film went on general release just a few months ago in 2013.However, Shakespeare did not invent the story of Romeo and Juliet. He reworked a long poem by Arthur Brooks, called "The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet", written in 1562. The tradition of tragic romances had been well established in literature - in particular Italian literature - for almost a hundred years, but what may be surprising is that many of the plot elements of Romeo and Juliet were all in Brooks' poem. The first meeting of the lovers at the ball, their secret marriage, Romeo's fight with Tybalt, the sleeping potion, and even the timing of their eventual suicides, are all episodes which we usually attribute to Shakespeare. This is characteristic of the author, who often wrote plays based on earlier works. Shakespeare's text is believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, and as such was one of his earliest performed plays, although not published until later. It was an immediate success; so popular that Shakespeare continued to rework and hone the notes from the play's performances. It was then first published in 1597, with later editions improving on it still further. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime, and has remained so, now being the most performed of all his plays alongside "Hamlet." Although the initial idea for Romeo and Juliet came from the earlier text, it is Shakespeare's wonderful play which is credited with having had such a profound influence on subsequent literature.It starts with a short prologue, in sonnet form, which tells the audience what is to follow. Nobody can be in any doubt that the story is a tragedy about young love, and that it will take their deaths to bring an end to family feuds. We are then straight into the action, which is a masterly piece of writing, full of bawdy references to ensure his audiences' attention, while providing all the background information needed to understand the world of the play. We are immediately told about the long-standing hatred between the two feuding families, the Capulets and the Montagues, and then immediately find ourselves engaged by an exciting brawl. Shakespeare cleverly establishes some of the major themes of the play, right at its start. He also portrays all of the layers of Veronese society starting with the servants, right through to Prince Escalus. Many of the secondary characters important to the play are also introduced here; for instance, Romeo's friend, Benvolio, thoughtful, pragmatic and fearful of the law, and Juliet's cousin Tybalt, a hothead, professing a hatred for peace as strong as his hatred for Montagues. A modern audience becomes aware that in the Verona of this play, masculine honour is not restricted to indifference to pain or insult. Tybalt makes it plain that a man must defend his honour at all times, whether the insult is verbal or physical. Mercutio is established as another friend; one who who can poke friendly fun at Romeo quite mercilessly. Benvolio is not nearly so quick-witted. Mercutio is confident, constantly joking, making puns and laughing. He is a passionate man, but his passions are different from Romeo's love and Tybalt's hate. Their passions are founded respectively upon two ideals of society - love and honour - but Mercutio believes in neither. He comes across as the character with the clearest vision. Just as Mercutio can see through words to other meanings, he can also see through the ideals held by those around him. He understands that often they are not sincerely held, but merely adopted for convenience. The characters in this play are multi-layered and complex, and Shakespeare is adept in revealing their subtleties by means of the action. Even as Mercutio dies, he utters his wild witticisms, cursing both the Montagues and the Capulets, "A plague o' both your houses! They have made worms' meat of me!""Ask for me tomorrow, and You shall find me a grave man."The character of Romeo develops significantly from the first impression we have of him as a stock callow youth. At first he is melancholy, distracted and lovelorn, as we expect. But surprisingly he is not lovesick over Juliet, but is in love with Rosaline. This love seems to stem almost entirely from the reading of bad love poetry! We understand from this that Romeo's love for Rosaline is an immature love, more a statement that he is ready to be in love than actual love. Perhaps Rosaline, who never appears in the play, exists only to demonstrate Romeo's passionate nature, his love of being in love. We meet Juliet in scene 3, and learn that in the Verona of this play, her status as a young woman leaves her with no power or choice in any social situation. Juliet at 13 years old is completely subject to parental influence, and is being encouraged to marry her parent's choice of Paris. Lady Capulet observes wryly that that she had already given birth to Juliet herself when she was Juliet's current age, before she was 14.In this way the forces that determine the fate of Romeo and Juliet are laid in place well before they even meet. Parental influence in the tragedy becomes a tool of fate. Juliet's arranged marriage with Paris, and the longstanding feud between Capulets and Montagues, will eventually contribute to the deaths of Romeo and Juliet. The reader enjoys the tension, and knowledge that terrible events are about to happen. Events and observations continually reinforce the presence and power of fate. Juliet's speeches have many different facets, and are capable of many interpretations. She often professes one thing, whilst we know she has an ulterior motive, and another intention. This is particularly evident when she is speaking to her parents, knowing that she intends to make her own decisions, she perversely wants to speak her mind, but deliberately couches her words in double meanings so that the truth will remain hidden. Juliet is a strong character in the play, particularly fascinating to a modern reader as she seems almost contemporary. She repeatedly goes against what is expected of women of her time and place, and takes action. The best example of this is when she drinks the sleeping potion. She comes up with many reasons why it might cause her harm, and recognises that drinking the potion might lead her to madness or even death. Yet she chooses to drink it anyway. This demonstrates a willingness to take her life into her own hands - and also hints at future events. There is never just one side to, or interpretation of, any event in this play. It is a portent. Juliet drinks the potion just as Romeo will later drink the apothecary's poison. Another instance of ominous foreshadowing is when the Nurse teases Juliet by saying that she is too tired to tell her what happened when she first met Romeo. This delay in telling Juliet the news is mirrored in a future scene, when the Nurse's anguish prevents her from relating news to Juliet and thereby causing terrible confusion. Another example of delicious dramatic irony is when Romeo is proclaiming his love to be the most powerful force in the world. Friar Laurence advises caution, saying, "These violent delights have violent endsAnd in their triump die, like fire and powderWhich, as they kiss, consume". The reader knows that the play is a tragedy, and that Romeo and Juliet will die. Shakespeare ingeniously manipulates the plot, so that we feel the impending doom, and are swept up in the inevitability of it all. Even the characters themselves are sometimes aware that they are pawns. Romeo cries, "O, I am fortune's fool!" when he realises he has killed Tybalt. He knows that by killing his new wife's cousin, he will be banished from Verona, and feels the inevitability of the situation. This emphasises the sense of fate - or fortune - that hangs over the play. Juliet also indicates in her speeches the power of fate and predestination. In her final scene with Romeo, the last moment they spend alive together, she says that he appears pale, as if he were dead. She looks out of her window and cries, "O God, I have an ill-divining soul! Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb."This vision blatantly foreshadows the end of the play. The next time she sees Romeo, he will be dead. Friar Laurence is a pivotal character in the play. When we first see him he is collecting herbs and flowers for medicinal purposes, demonstrating a deep knowledge of the properties of the plants he collects, and alerting the reader to what may be to come. He meditates on the duality of good and evil that exists in all things; another clearly portentous speech. Referring to the plants, Friar Laurence says that, although everything in nature has a useful purpose, it can also lead to misfortune if used improperly, "For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give, Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied; And vice sometime's by action dignified". Friar Laurence ruminates on how good may be perverted to evil and evil may be purified by good. By making plans to marry Romeo and Juliet, he hopes that the good of their love will reverse the evil of the hatred between the feuding families. Shakespeare portrays him as a benign, wise philosopher. But his schemes also serve as tools of fate; secretly marrying the two lovers, sending Romeo to Mantua, and staging Juliet's apparent death. The tragic failure of his plans are outside his responsibility, and due to chance.The structure of the play is carefully controlled; it would be interesting at this distance to read the earlier versions. Different poetic forms are used by different characters, and sometimes the form changes as the character develops. There are many instances of the sonnet, as the reader would expect, because it is a perfect, idealised poetic form often used to write about love. The play starts with a Prologue in sonnet form, a masterly precis of the story. As it describes Romeo and Juliet’s eventual death, it also helps to create the sense of fate that permeates the entire play.Romeo himself, develops his expertise in the sonnet over the course of the play. When Romeo and Juliet meet they speak just fourteen lines before their first kiss. These fourteen lines make up a shared sonnet, which creates a link between their love and their tragic destiny, as told in the introductory prologue. There are numerous instances of such tightly written formal structure, which is remarkable in such an early play. Even the dramatic action of the play has a tight schedule, spanning just 4 days. Perhaps this is why many of the most important scenes, such as the balcony scene, take place either very late at night or very early in the morning. Shakespeare makes great use of effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten the tension, and bringing minor characters into the foreground to increase depth and interest. His additional use of sub-plots to enrich the story, is often cited as an early sign of his dramatic skill.This play has everything; love, beauty, and romance, but also sudden, fatal violence early on. Viciousness and danger are continually present, yet just at the point when they threaten to overcome the reader, the action will be tempered by wit, comedy and humour. We are in a masculine world in which notions of honour, pride, and status are prone to erupt in a fury of conflict, but there is a strong female who defies her confined expectations. Rashness, vengeance, passion, grief; they are all here. The motif of fate continues to the very end of the play. Romeo proclaims, "Then I defy you, stars" and"I will lie with thee tonight" in a last desperate attempt to control his own destiny by spending eternity with Juliet.Yet in this ultimate example of tragic irony, this defiant act seals both his fate, and their double suicide. Shakespeare tells his audience that nothing can withstand the power of fate. The neat twists of the ending are supremely ironic, devastating and heart-wrenching. Here is Romeo, in despair,"O true apothecary!Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die."And on waking, Juliet,"I will kiss thy lips;Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,To make die with a restorative...O happy dagger!This is thy sheath...There rust and let me die!"It is said that the best way to appreciate Shakespeare is to go to a live performance of a play. Of course in one sense this is true of any play; the live action is how the play was intended to be experienced. But there is a lot to be said for reading Shakespeare on the page. The structure and poetry of the language is so much more evident. The puns and in-jokes are so much clearer. The reader can give pause to properly interpret the manifold meanings of both the exciting events and the rousing speeches. And above all we can marvel at the mastery of a writer who can still speak to us with relevance, move us with poetry and story, and entertain his audience well over 400 years later."For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

437219868	"Never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo "...........The ultimate love story, 400 years old, you may ask why? William Shakespeare's narrative , the poetry, a tragic saga drenched in beauty, the words are magical , a reader will be entranced by its imagery , no one could be better...really a long exquisite poem disguised as a play set in the 14th century of the Renaissance, in Verona, Italy during the turbulent age of petty kingdoms , fierce wars and passionate times. The short but interesting lives, young marriages and early exists, the atmosphere thick with unseen calamities...Romeo , a Montague, loves Juliet, a Capulet...that is a big problem, the two teenagers don't care or understand the long lasting bloody feud, between their families. Hate is not them, passion is...the opposite...a great love consumes the immature couple , after just a few hours of knowing each other they impulsively decide on a secret marriage. Romeo had gone with his friends to a perilous, masquerade party given annually by Juliet's father, at his house, the sumptuous feast is strictly off -limits to their archenemies the Montagues, of course this makes for a rather tantalizing challenge, brave or moronic , the youths want some excitement...The Montague stranger immediately falls in love with this supposedly loathsome girl , of the rival evil clan, the daughter of the leader , the couple are smitten... not knowing their true identities, yet nothing matters to Romeo and Juliet, even after the revelations ... except feelings, too much so it will cause heartache. Then reality sets in ...Mercutio a good friend of Romeo's, is slain in a tawdry street brawl, by Tybalt Juliet's cousin...the lover of hers seeks revenge and kills the Capulet. Now what...Juliet must decide, stay loyal to the family or continue to be a wife, their secret marriage performed by Friar Lawrence, he naively believed the joining of the two would end the foolish conflict...Nevertheless blood flows again, even the Prince in the city cannot stop the animosity, his threatened harsh penalties, including death, does nothing to calm the situation. Romeo is banished forever from town, the distraught daughter of a Capulet is told to marry Count Paris a relative of the ruler Prince Escalus ...How can a 14- year-old girl, not quite a woman, cope. Her adoring servant, who raised her, yet an uneducated nurse, tells Juliet to marry Paris and forget her first wedding...Will she... Friar Lawrence has a dangerous plan... the only hope for the pair, it could result in a happy solution ....A story that will be read again and again...love is always in fashion , especially the kind that engulfs every walking minute in a young life...they know nothing else.
1284850051	I don't know if fortunately or unfortunately, but I read the book in Shakespearean English. I did understand it, but it was so difficult. I got the plot and stuff. I understood the story, the way it is written. I like the story a lot, the ending even more! In my opinion, it is a bit too long, but I still recommend it. I think it will be better to read it in "normal" English, since I read it like that short time ago and it's much easier to understand it and it can be read in a much more fluent way. I recommend you to read it in normal English, it's easier to chew it. Good play!

3870701707	So.I finally read this.I regret everything. review to come
258118162	Review As I looked over my previously read books and searched for one that was missing a review, Romeo and Juliet stood out to me. But then I thought about it... who doesn't know about this play? Who hasn't read it in school sometime in the past? Who hasn't watched a movie version or seen some sort of take on the classic tortured romance story? And why on earth would anyone care to read another review, let alone my review, on it? Exactly. So... don't look for much here as I'm sure most everyone has read it already. And I'm not that funny to even make reading my opinions worth it. That said... a few shared thoughts about what I've learned from this play:1. Parents exist to torture their children. It's a simple fact. If your child wants X, it is your responsibility to keep X away from him/her.2. Love will always end in disaster. Don't attempt it without proper back-up.3. Even though someone looks dead, they probably aren't. Kill them again just to be sure.4. Your bros or girls don't always have your back.5. Magic powders are the cure for everything. Always trust what you don't understand. And just inhale it like the world is about to end.In all sincerity, I do like the play a lot. I've enjoyed countless interpretations. I think parts of it are brilliant and parts of it are pure illogical nonsense. Every TV show and movie has their own re-appropriation to tell. Not everything can be perfect when it comes to love.

1580812	"Hey! I'm eatin' here!"So you're at a nice outdoor cafe one day, eating your lunch, and all of a sudden some fool kids come running through the square with their swords out (apparently they've got some strong Second Amendment advocates in Verona) and insist on skewering each other right there in front of you in the square! And seriously all you want to do is just eat your (damn fine, not that anyone asked you) pasta and get back to work before your lord finds some excuse to fire you. But nooooo, instead you've gotta deal with a whole lot of screaming, panicky, dangerous crowds rubbernecking around (and betting on) these rich kids fighting over who knows (or cares) what and there's no way you're gonna get back in time.Yeah.. that's about the read I got from Shakespeare on this play. This is an excellent deconstruction of the elements that make up major Greek tragedies, breaking it down into parts and fitting them into modern day (or it was then) society. Shakespeare was a great adapter of older tales retold to suit his own purposes, and here, it shows.So there's this Greek story, right? It's set up on this grand scale, with major, crashing chords that are played over and over throughout the tale. There's the Greek chorus, of course, at the beginning and then somewhere in the middle to remind us what it is we're watching. There's a good deal of sky imagery to go along with this invoking of the old gods- moons, suns, clouds, night, stars, dreams, even the otherworldly fae("Juliet is the sun," "the lark the herald of the dawn" "take him and cut him into little stars", the Queen Mab speech, tons of other examples). By the same token, the gods of the Underworld are equally called to witness- lots of death, grave, earth imagery as well (examples: too many to count). These extreme terms are then often juxtaposed next to each other ("wedding bed/grave" is probably the most frequently used, for obvious reasons) throughout the course of the tale. Through this, Shakespeare shows you just how seriously his main characters take everything that's going on. Especially Romeo and Juliet, of course, but also all the other family members of the Capulets and Montagues (with the exception of Mercutio). Everything is on a Grand Scale. Everything is the Most Important Thing Ever! Nothing could be more Lofty!....Until Shakespeare quite strongly states his opposition to that idea.He thrusts this Grand Tragedy into the midst of a bustling, thriving city, where the participants must brush elbows with and be interrupted by the every day facts of life. He uses each stupid mistake to show us all the ways the end we know is coming could have been and should have been averted, were it not for the stupidest thing that could possibly happen happening in every single scenario. I ended up thinking this after seeing all those scenes of servants at the Capulet house preparing for parties, servants running about the city with messages, escorting Nurse on her errands, inserting a plague that prevented the letter from getting to Romeo. While the two teenage idiots are upstairs enacting this farce, life is happening all around them, and they are just way way too self-centered to see it. Juliet is a bit more aware than Romeo, though. She understands the conflict between the two families, what it will likely mean for them, what she needs to do to get what she wants, and how to accomplish it. And yet... even she is so centered on the fulfillment of what she wants she can barely pause to think of others. There's a great little moment when Nurse comes back from seeing Romeo in the square and Juliet is really impatient to hear what he had to say. Nurse is all 'I'm old! I'm out of breath, give me a second!' Juliet doesn't seem to really care if she dies on the spot, so long as she gets the information she wants, and then Nurse says, accidentally, the words that I think explain this whole play:Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and acourteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, Iwarrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?EXACTLY. She's THIRTEEN, you guys. That's exactly what he SHOULD have said when he met her, and didn't. You know why? 'Cause Romeo's a virgin who really really would prefer not to be. He tells the Friar that he likes Juliet instead of Rosalind now because she loves him back and will presumably have sex with him whereas Rosalind would not. Friar's great response: "O, she (Rosalind) knew well/Thy love did read by rote and could not spell."Just another case of why True Love Waits is a poor plan! If only Romeo had himself a girlfriend, this whole thing could have been avoided.This play displays the soul of adolescence. Both positive and negative. Negative seems to be more promiently on display at first. The characters are self-centered, impatient, convinced that if what they want doesn't come true the way they want it to, the whole world will end. There's also another big adolescent theme: masks. Teenagers spend a lot of time trying to figure out what face they want to wear to the world, what they want to present themselves as, so it makes sense that there's tons of masks, hiding (lots of hiding) and subterfuge going on here.What's interesting to me though is that it also shows the other side of adolescence, the part that's thinking about growing up, but can't quite leave behind his childish things. One major example of this to me the influence of several characters on Romeo- Mercutio and the Friar, even Benvolio. It seems to me that they're starting to get through to the guy in the short time he's there. Especially Mercutio. He gets him to go to the party, gets him to laugh and joke again, and manages to give him some fine counsel into the bargain. I witnessed a lot of echoes of Mercutio coming out in Romeo... they just don't seem to quite take hold. For instance there's Mercutio's magnificent Queen Mab speech, which he follows up with: "True, I talk of dreams,Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,Which is as thin of substance as the airAnd more inconstant than the wind"Ie, don't take all these heart burnings so seriously, kid! Romeo does appear to consider this later, though he does dismiss it. Similarly, the Friar's long speech about manhood (ie, his great smackdown of how why Romeo is terrible) seems to get to him, even Benvolio's urgings that he'll find someone else to love at the banquet seem to have worked (if not quite in the way he intended). He just couldn't quite get there. Juliet herself... well, I think we see a lot of the mature woman that she could have become- but she doesn't have a woman's experience or resources yet and she ends up giving up rather than having the opportunity to grow. Which, funnily enough, her father predicts in the first act when Paris asks for her hand in marriage with: "Younger than she are happy mothers made," and the dad answers with, "And too soon marr'd are those so early made." Of course, he then proceeds to do the opposite of his own advice, but I don't think that undermines the message.Elizabeth mentioned in her review that she thought there were a lot of comedic elements in this play. I agree- what with the servant characters, the stupid mixups, and that raillery that takes place between the minor members of the family, and that one Romeo/Mercutio scene before the Nurse interrupts them. My closest guess is that was Shakespeare saying, "Look! I could be writing this! But instead, you people want to see this stupid stupid tale enacted stupidly, so I can't! I can write this soapy crap if you want me to, but this isn't who I am." Or, as Mercutio says: "Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now artthou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:for this driveling love is like a great natural,that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole."And yet... for all of that annoyance, that satire, that social criticism, that biting realism... for all of that, Shakespeare still gives this tale a beautiful sympathy, putting gorgeous words into the mouths of his leads. He makes Romeo and Juliet people, people you can envision and who you know, people you don't want to see die, in spite of all their errors right there in front of you. He respects the beauty in the craziness, explores it in wonder. He was, after all, a storyteller, and if this was a story to affect people, it deserved to be told and told as well as he knew it to be in him to do, with a understanding that extends from his characters to the audience that wanted to see it.It is worth reading. Even if you think you've heard it all before. After all, even if you don't like it it is "not so long as (it) is a tedious tale."
533793222	True confessions time: I've read Romeo and Juliet at least once, maybe more (probably it was in one of my college English courses) and mostly thought, great poetry, but GAH! silly kids! idiotic people! I've seen it on stage once or twice -- one production cast Romeo's family entirely with black actors and Juliet's family with white ones, to bring the feuding a little closer to home, I guess. It was interesting, but still, didn't really move me. I'm sure I teared up during the final scene, but I'm easy to manipulate emotionally that way. Books and movies make me cry All. The. Time. It's not a major achievement.And then I saw the movie Shakespeare in Love (on cable TV, years after it was in the theaters). The movie has Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow doing numerous scenes from R&J together, not to mention a little Dame Judi Dench on the side, which always helps, and I totally ate it up. The actors were amazing, and it hit me right in the heart.So all of that is to say that yes, Shakespeare is a genius, but sometimes it just takes the right set of actors in one of his shows to make you love it emotionally as well as intellectually. Which reminds me of my favorite actors ever in a Shakespeare production, Oberon and Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream ... but that's a different story.

1263128586	Romeo and Juliet have set the tone for many a romantic relationship around the world, for more than four centuries now. How many times has a young person, caught up in the emotional rush of first love, looked at their significant other and thought, “She’s my Juliet,” or, “He’s the Romeo I had hoped for”? When William Shakespeare wrote The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, I’m sure he knew it was a good play. Yet I don’t think he intended to define the West’s notions of romantic love for the next four centuries and more; and I’m not sure he would have wanted audiences, either in his time or now, to take the play that way.The scenario, of course, is a long-standing quarrel between two eminent Veronese families, the Montagues and the Capulets - “Two households, both alike in dignity/In fair Verona”. The quarrel, as we all know, will lead to tragedy for “a pair of star-crossed lovers”, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet; and the phrase “star-crossed” seems crucial here. The stars, it was believed in Shakespeare’s time, influenced one’s fate; and Romeo and Juliet is very much a tragedy of fate. In the later tragedies of Shakespeare’s artistic maturity - Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, Othello - the main character makes choices that move the character toward a tragic end. Romeo and Juliet, by contrast, is a play in which cruel fate intervenes more than once, setting the title characters on a predestined path.Romeo and Juliet meet at a Capulet party and fall in love at first sight. The words that accompany the young lovers’ first kiss – with Romeo saying, “Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!/Give me my sin again”, and Juliet sardonically replying, “You kiss by the book” – are part of our culture, like the entire dialogue from the unforgettable balcony scene. Meanwhile, the reader or play-goer meets an intriguing array of characters. On the Montague side, there is Mercutio, Romeo’s wild and flamboyant friend. When he is fatally stabbed, Mercutio realizes that his death is a direct result of the Capulet-Montague feud, and declares, “They have made worms’ meat of me….A plague on both your houses!” Mercutio’s death scene is one of the most powerful in all of Shakespeare’s oeuvre.On the Capulet side, there is Tybalt, the nephew of Capulet’s wife. In 1960’s Great Britain, Tybalt would have fit right in among the Mods or the Rockers -- a true “king mixer,” who loves fighting for fighting’s sake. When Benvolio asks Tybalt to help him break up a quarrel among the Capulets’ and Montagues’ servants, Tybalt’s response – “Peace? Peace? I hate the word/As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee” – is characteristic. One senses that this violence-loving character will come to a violent end; but on a first reading or viewing of Romeo and Juliet, it is surprising to see at whose hand that violent end comes. Juliet’s Nurse loves and is loyal to her lady, but at one crucial moment in the play shows herself only too willing to bend to situational ethics. And it is scarring to see the cruelty that Juliet’s parents display toward their daughter when, because she has been secretly married to Romeo, she refuses her father’s choice of the young Count Paris as a husband for her; Juliet’s mother, in a moment of foreshadowing, declares, “I would the fool were married to her grave!” Old man Capulet meanwhile lets Juliet know that he is perfectly willing to disown her, cast her out, if she refuses to follow his marital plans for her: “An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;/An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets!”The play’s focus on destiny becomes crystallized in the character of Friar Lawrence, a good and kind man of God who hopes to find a way to bring the two lovers together and reconcile the two warring families. Through a cruel twist of fate, he achieves the second goal but not the first. Yet Friar Lawrence also serves as a choral figure, speaking to Romeo crucial words that may represent Shakespeare’s true attitude toward Romeo and Juliet and their young love: “These violent delights have violent ends/And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,/Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey/Is loathsome in his own deliciousness/And in the taste confounds the appetite./Therefore love moderately”. Friar Lawrence’s words evoke the classical ideal of μηδὲν ἄγαν, mêden agan, nothing in excess. In crucial ways, Romeo’s behavior in particular is excessive; we sympathize with him as a young man in love, but by the play’s end he has killed two people. (One of those killings almost always gets left out of the film adaptations, including both Franco Zeffirelli’s classically inflected 1968 film and Baz Luhrmann’s Blade Runner-style, post-modern 1996 film.) Even young love, Shakespeare seems to be saying, can be taken too far. It is not that the play provides a direct critique of two teenagers in love; they are teenagers, and everyone knows how difficult the teenage years are. It is not reasonable to expect teenagers to behave with the rationality that adults are supposed to display. The problem, rather, is that Romeo and Juliet are surrounded by immoderate adults who, even though they should know better, willingly give free rein to their own emotional excesses. Considering the behavior that Romeo and Juliet have been witnessing all their lives, how should we expect them to behave?But the love of Romeo and Juliet is compelling, and the tragedy of their shared destiny breaks the heart; all logic and all Aristotelian appeals to reason fly forth, blown away as if by an Adriatic breeze. The closing words of Escalus, Prince of Verona – “Capulet, Montague,/See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,/That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!/And I, for winking at your discords too,/Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished” – provide a compelling summation of the play’s themes. Writing on this Saint Valentine’s Day, I cannot help concluding that – whether we are reading the play as Shakespeare intended, or not – the canonical status of Romeo and Juliet as the greatest love story in the English language seems to be safe for the foreseeable future.
4093049060	the amount of pure spite and enjoyment I got from one-starring this play is concerning.eh.
1986534117	This great book (drama of course) I read in a single night. Naturally, an English graduate seldom can remain away from Shakespeare and his realm. However, even as an individual, before I began my studies seriously, Shakespeare and some of his creations were on the list 'to be read'. Romeo and Juliet is a play, to be clear at the beginning. Yes, as critics (modern ones) claim, this is perhaps the most 'unlikely' play which does not synchronise with the reality as others by the same dramatist. Nevertheless, let's give the 'play' its due - it surely does create that sensation which Shakespeare wanted to. The ephemeral romance between the 'first sight lovers' and the enemies sworn to suck the blood out of their lives... everything went on perfectly to (at least) create the star of today's Hollywood - Leo! The book has its merits as well as the demerits. Shakespeare is the vacuum. You can keep your experiments going on... I would like to rather appreciate him for his creation this time. I enjoyed reading the play and truly did!

To distract himself and look at other beauties, a wise man said😭here our homeboy Romeo meets a pretty lady that catches his eyes (Juliet) and let me tell you the switch up is crazy because he now says: “Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.” and I was likehormones gone crazy like didn't y'all met 5 minutes ago? Might have been even two when he said that he was madly and irrevocably in love with Rosaline.I hate instalove from the bottom of my heart and I don't believe in love at first sight🙁 so the first part of the play was painful to read. But I understand the concept, what the poet was trying to express.Ngl my man Shakespeare got game, I think I'll check out more of his work in the future‼️

47269883	7/4/23 Update: This summer I learn that the two teens that played Romeo and Juliet in the Zeffirelli film version are suing the Zeffirelli estate for being asked—as minors—to play the “marriage bed” scene naked. They now view this coercion as sexual child abuse. I respect their retrospective regret. 4/11/20 update: I introduced the teens in my house to my beloved (1968) Franco Zeffirelli (RIP, 6/19) version of this tale last night, me with the book out to read along and, you know, help them understand what the heck was going on sometimes; not always appreciated: Da-addd!” When I taught the play to high schoolers I taught decades ago I must have used a somewhat edited version, without the naked marriage bed scene that I hadn’t recalled. My middle schoolers were quiet and we were all a bit embarrassed…. But in general we agreed it was a great play and film, much fine writing and with that sex and violence appeal to the young in it.Original review, somewhat edited:“Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.” Reread this after having seen, read and taught it many times, on the occasion of introducing three kids, 10, 11, and 13 to the play for the first time, primarily through seeing the Baz Luhrmann film featuring Leonard DiCaprio and Claire Danes. They loved it, though the highlight of the first half viewing was the 11-year-old saying "Love?! Didn't they just meet like five minutes ago?!" :)He has a point, but literature condenses experience for us in many ways, and this is a romantic tragedy, with poetry and youthful passion as the central focus, and that worked for them. In this mod and wild and controversial film version, the Montague-Capulet feud, once adapted by Leonard Bernstein for his West Story family feud, gets highlighted as contemporary Italian street violence (complete with contemporary music, switchblades and fast cars), and the romance is as it ever was, fast and furious and fated.I, the father/English teacher, took the occasion to reread the play for myself and shared poetic passages with them and helped them explain what was going on. So is it a great play? “My bounty is as boundless as the sea,My love as deep; the more I give to thee,The more I have, for both are infinite.”Is that among the best of Shakespeare's writing? I don't know. I would rank the four tragedies, and Midsummer Night's Dream and oh so many others above this play, but it does best what few of his plays do; it captures youthful passion. Luhrmann even has the moody, love-sick Romeo write love-sick poetry in his journal as he sits by the sea. But I could still get lost in that balcony scene:“But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.It is my lady, O, it is my love!Oh, that she knew she were!” I prefer the Franco Zeffirelli film version, more romantic, with wonderful score. Here's the balcony scene, you are welcome!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0qao...

JULIET:I want to be a starOf the stage and screenI don't want a bit partOr a role that’s obsceneI've had enough of men who work All week for minimum wagesI want to be rememberedThrough time eternal...and for ages and agesMy love’s a director who makes serious filmsNot just action flics designed to wowEven his money men are all agreed“Romeo, Romeo, we’re for art now”The moment he cast his eyes on meHe sat me down and cast me on his couchHe said he’d get my photo in the magazinesAnd we’d drive around all night in limousines Romeo and Juliet resolve to escape in Romeo’s car.JULIET:Just so I could live in this promised landI turned my back on Bruce’s traveling bandNo more Buicks or Fiats for this CapuletDear husband, I pledge to be your wife, JulietSo I can feature in a film cameoIn the front seat of your Alfa, Romeo.Tybalt chases them on a motor bike. He crosses suddenly into Romeo's path and clips the front edge of the car. He loses control of his bike and falls to the thundering road. Romeo can't avoid running over the top of Tybalt and killing him. Still, Romeo rolls his car three times while taking evasive action, and both Romeo and Juliet are knocked unconscious when their heads hit the side door panels.ROMEO:I dreamt my lady came and found me dead (in that order).Juliet wakes first, only to look over to the driver’s seat, where she sees Romeo. She can’t tell if he is alive or dead. She realises that her headache has now become extreme. If she can treat her pain, she can try to help Romeo. She touches her forehead where it hit the inside of the car door and pulls her hand away, covered in blood that still seems to be flowing profusely. Tears form in her eyes and her eyesight becomes blurry. She reaches into her purse and takes another four tablets, in the hope that it will kill her pain. She lapses into unconsciousness.Shortly afterwards, Romeo awakes and finds Juliet still beside him. There is blood everywhere and a white froth has descended from her lips and dried on her chin.ROMEO:O my love! my wife!Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yetIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,And death's pale flag is not advanced there. Romeo wipes the froth from her lips and gives her one last kiss. He lifts the left leg of his trousers and pulls out his knife.ROMEO:O, hereWill I set up my everlasting rest,And shake the yoke of inauspicious starsFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O youThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kissA dateless bargain to engrossing death!Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!Thou desperate pilot, now at once run onThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!Here's to my love!Romeo drags the knife across his throat. He drops the knife and holds his hand to the artery in his neck. He continues to feel the slow, regular pumping of his heart, until it pumps no more.Now, Juliet wakes again. Still groggy, she looks over to Romeo. Convinced by the abundance of blood that he has died, she shakes the rest of the tablets in the bottle into her hand and swallows them eagerly.JULIET:O true apothecary!Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.She kisses Romeo and dies.PRINCE:Never was a story of more woeThan this of Bruce, Juliet and her Romeo.Bruce lives alone and works his day job, almost like an automaton. His only salvation is the time he spends in his beat up old Buick. Every night, he drives the streets of Verona, haunted by the love he felt for Juliet and the guilt that it was the pills he gave her that took her life. Sometimes, through the tears in his eyes, he imagines that he sees her walking down the street, only to lose sight of her as she slips quietly down an alleyway.BRUCE:You're still in love with all the wonder she brings And every muscle in your body sings as the highway ignites You work nine to five and somehow you survive till the night Hell all day they're busting you up on the outside But tonight you're gonna break on through to the inside And it'll be right, it'll be right, and it'll be tonight And you know she will be waiting there And you'll find her somehow you swear Somewhere tonight you run sad and free Until all you can see is the night.APOLOGIES:Please don't sue me, Boss.How can I possibly argue that your lyrics deserve to be on the same page as Shakespeare, unless I shamelessly misappropriate them in the pursuit of parody, pastiche, spoof, send-up or lampoon?This isn't damning with faint praise. This is no piss-take. This is a full-on homage, a big hurrah, a laud almighty. I say, more kudos to the Boss!As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it (as quoted by my WikiLawyer), "parody...is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text." I already have multiple copies of your albums on both CD and vinyl, even the boring ones. I don't need any more, until you release 50th anniversary editions with bonus disks I don't already have. [I really hope I'm still around in 2045, so I can be the first to buy "The Ghost of Tom Joad Uncut".]If that doesn't convince you it's not worth suing me, Brucewad, I won't have any money left to support this great music industry of ours that is being killed by illegal downloads.Please get your lawyers to spare my humble upload.And if they do come looking for me, they'd better be pretty damned fit, coz tramps like us, baby we were born to run.
2639162868	Popsugar challenge 2020 - A book with a pink cover I've managed to live almost four decades without reading or watching this classic and I was pretty excited to get going. On paper this is my ideal story, boy meets girl, girl already has boy. In reality this wasnt my ideal at all, the play format is really not my jam and the theres only so much of 'yee art thou donkey' language that I can take. Basically I didnt bond with anything except the bottle of poison. This piece of literature is often associated with romanticizing suicide so from that standpoint it was an interesting read for me. And did I find it romantic? No. Tragic, most definitely yes. I'm sorry Shakespeare, maybe I'd do better with a more modern translation. Who am I kidding, I'll watch the film!
1507372104	There is nothing romantic about Romeo & Juliet. If anything, this felt like an intentional mockery to me. So if anyone thinks this is categorized as Romance, I will stare at them like they've lost their heads. There have been debates about whether or not Romeo & Juliet is a satire. I'm 101% sure that this is a satirical play in which Shakespeare, the genius bastard, mocked and made fun of hot-headed, foolish teenagers. The man laughed in the face of insta-love (lust), and I laughed along with him. If he was here, I'd offer him a high five because hey, some of his mockery is true. Many teens (I'm not saying all) tend to confuse lust and admiration for love. We also shoot our mouths like bullets at the adults who are supposed to 'know better'. I may or may not be one of those teens.I've read Hamlet, Macbeth, and Julius Caesar where characters there are smart in their actions. So... why would he create a fool like Romeo? I've read The Tempest where the relationship between Miranda and Ferdinand took a slow, budding pace so why the sudden proclaimations of love and wedding vows here? It does not adds up. Unless of course, you see this in a satirical point of view.Besides, Shakespeare always struck me as someone who explores in the deep meaning of love. Love is not a subject he took lightly. This I assumed also by judging from what many people say about his sonnets.I didn't feel the air of tragic when Shakespeare killed off the characters here; poison down Romeo's throat, sword in Juliet's gut. It felt like Shakespeare himself was laughing his ass off.Lookit these stupid teenagers. Lookit how blindly they throw themselves into relationships! Ha...ha...ha!So bugger with the insta-lust. It's laughable, unrealistic even, but I've had the time of my life reading this play. If Shakespeare indeed meant this to be a satire, he did a great job.
2928924166	Rating: 4 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I can’t believe I actually liked this! I don’t know why I went into it believing it would be hard to read and boring, but it was so easy and fun to read even though it is a tragedy. So many witty lines and people being too dramatic, I loved it.
2393434608	"Hay para mí más peligro en tus ojos que en afrontar veinte espadas desnudas".La primera lectura del año en llevarse las 5 estrellas. Y yo me pregunto por qué no leí este clásico antes.Todo el mundo conoce la historia, y en lo personal, es una de mis favoritas, he visto un montón de películas y nunca me canso de verlas, mi favorita es la de 1996.Pero leer la obra fue una sensación distinta, sentía que estaba ahí en Verona con todos, y me daban ganas de decirle a Romeo "NO LO HAGAS".Ame las palabras que se dedicaban Romeo y Julieta, y aunque su final fue horrible, deja ver la realidad también. Y por lo menos a mí, me hizo poner en su lugar, y entendí el por qué hicieron lo que hicieron.Pero esta historia es una obra maestra y más para en la época en la que fue escrita.Por eso me gustó tanto, y más por la hermosa escritura de Shakespeare. Leeré más de sus obras.Una maravilla.
2722683612	Never have thirteen year olds sounded so elegant and poetic yet acted like the biggest dumb dumbs
78774618	I saw this book/play described as "A love affair between a 17 year old and a 13 year old that left 6 people dead". Good description.
4163052371	Have I been successfully avoiding this play until now? Yes.Did I love it?Of course, I did.It’s been more than two years since I read anything Shakespeare, and truth be told, I missed it. It’s always the same. I tell myself to pick up a Wouldiwas Shookethspeared play I haven’t read yet, but I’m overcome by laziness and a general lack of self-discipline every time. When I do pick one up, however, I end up loving it every single time. The power of the Bard, I guess!I believe my reasoning for avoiding the play for such a long time is easy to understand:it’s the one Shakespeare play that is most ingrained in pop culture. EVERYONE knows at least the basics, and how the story ends is not exactly a well-kept secret. The play has been taken apart and analysed and re-imagined and adapted so many times, you do not only lose count of the pieces that make up the Romeo and Juliet verse, but you also quickly lose any kind of interest in the seemingly generic story of two very dumb love-stricken heterosexual fools falling in love with each other. But, and here comes my big but, despite all these things and my previous knowledge of the story, I very much enjoyed reading the Bard’s most famous play. It took the help of a dictionary (reading Shakespeare do be hard for non-native speakers of English) to be able to fully appreciate what he wrote (and there are still terms and words I don’t understand). Still, I absolutely love getting lost in his writing, reading passages, again and again, discovering tragic and depth or just pure sarcasm and banter in between the lines. Shakespeare is one of those authors that make me grab a pencil and do the unimaginable: write in my books! His choice of words and language is one for the ages (or so I hope).This is not a university paper (thank God), but I do want to address some of the most popular negative reviews on here focusing on what Nate described as “enlightened adults injecting this into our youth as a classic love story for the generations, providing further support for their angst-filled false ideas of love and marriage (...)”It sure is interesting that many reviewers say it’s the play aka Shakespeare himself that ‘elevates’ a story about two teenagers falling in love into the greatest love story of all time.Because actually, Obviously, it was not Shakespeare who elevated the story of Romeo and Juliet into the greatest love story of all time. That would be the thousands of teachers, professors, scholars, even teenagers themselves, who continue to falsely put this play on a pedestal and worship it as “the greatest love story ever written”.This is a piece of fiction – highbrow literature – and as such, everyone has the right to interpret it as they wish. There is no right or wrong when it comes to literary interpretations, there is only plausible and less plausible. However, and here comes my interpretation, I think a case can be made – and a valid one at that – that Shakespeare never meant to sell this as a play about the power and beauty of love. Quite the contrary. I believe that Shakespeare meant to showcase how blind love can make people, how love can make people act silly, destructive, stupid, and proud. He never meant for this play to be taken as an example of how unconditional love should look like.If anything, Romeo’s infatuation with Rosaline (he says that "[t]he all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun") that vanishes into thin air the second he clamps eyes on Juliet, is a clear sign of how inconsistent and fickle he is.Who are we to know how long he would have loved Juliet if they hadn’t died so early? Would it only have taken another woman, prettier than Juliet, for him to fall in love again?Very likely.When we assess his and Juliet’s relationship, we need to keep in mind his fickleness and tendency to throw everything overboard in the blink of an eye. This inherent characteristic flaw of his, together with Juliet’s childish naivete and inexperience, is the foundation upon which their relationship is built and doomed to fall. The reader, as well as Shakespeare, knows that this is absolutely not how an ideal romantic relationship should look like. The death of two protagonists is what makes this play a tragedy but is the fact that they committed suicide rather than living without the other just tragic for the sake of a love that was never meant to be, or are their deaths a literary means employed to tell the reader that stupidity, recklessness, acting against your family’s will, and abandoning reason must be punished?What I love about this play is its ambiguity and ability to provoke discussions even more than 400 years after ‘publication’, but I believe that it’s worth asking yourself this one question:Was Romeo and Juliet really written as a great love story or where you just fed the belief that this play is the most romantic story ever by a society that continues to seek positivity and validation in tragic heterosexual love stories even though they might have been written to warn against the dangers of young love?
3528564545	TW: suicide, death- - -Disclaimer: While I agree with my past opinion of liking this play, I would definitely have a much deeper and more appreciative opinion if I had read it now, as my tastes have definitely matured since then. I was a 14-year-old hater when I wrote this and I really didn’t understand the purpose and significance of this play.- - -I do not care about this book or anyone in it at all. We've been reading it in school for two months now, and for the life of me, I never enjoyed reading it once. Not even when I was assigned to read as the Nurse, which was actually kind of agonizing. Everyone in my English class would be assigned to read for a specific role in each class, and we all hated it. No one in my class liked this book. I understand that it's a ClAsSiC so I should appreciate them...but no. I don't see why I should have to slave through Old English and the troubles of an instalovey forbidden romance plot. Please.Romeo and Juliet, as everyone should know by now, is a tragedy by Shakespeare that illustrates the forbidden love between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet. The Montague and Capulet families have personal vendettas against each other, as has been going on for centuries, but after Romeo sneaks into a Capulet party to find his rejected love, Rosaline, he sets his sights upon Juliet instead, and they instantly fall in love. It's also so dramatically boring. If you just read my plot summary and thought this would interest you, it probably wouldn't.Normally, I'd continue this negative review by saying something I enjoyed about it...but I genuinely can't think of anything. I've rated it two stars because I didn't think it matched the level of The Catcher in the Rye or The Old Man and the Sea, but there was still nothing good about this book at all. The characters were all bland, the romance was stale, and I couldn't comprehend the writing. If you feel like you should respond to that by saying, "yOu'Re sO iMmAtUrE, iT's ShAkEsPeArE aNd OlD EnGlIsh," then I'll say, yes. That's true. And? Just because it was written in the 1500s doesn't mean I have to appreciate it, or try understanding the Old English, or think that because it's an old book, I shouldn't need to love the plot or characters the same way I do with the typical books I read. I know the writing is outdated, and if it's outdated, then why are we even reading it?Romeo and Juliet were not in love, I'm sorry to say. I'm pretty sure the point of Romeo and Juliet is to differentiate between love and infatuation, but I feel the need to come out and say that because my friend loved this book because of the romance. Romeo and Juliet met when they were teenagers and made out within thirty seconds of meeting each other. Then they fell "in love" and got married within the week. The whole book was some sort of instalove fantasy. I'm sorry, but I really don't see how this sort of plot appeals to people. When I read about romance, I want the storylines to feel real. Even if the point of this story was to illustrate that they weren't really in love, the way it was written was made to seem as if Shakespeare wanted everyone to believe they were in love. There didn't seem to be anything ironic about it.The fact that my English teacher wanted us to interpret certain scenes as comedic relief was actually funny to me. No matter what context, a man celebrating his daughter's arranged marriage is not funny. A priest ordering around his servants is not funny. Either way, how am I supposed to find something funny if I can barely understand it? Are there some sort of medieval sex jokes that I'm missing or is Shakespeare just a terrible comedian?I was so frustrated with most of these characters too. Romeo was impulsive and stupid, Juliet was a wet rag, Friar Laurence was a manipulative failing grade, the parents were all possessive, Paris and Tybalt were possessive, and the Nurse was annoying. Why couldn't Mr. William Shakespeare give me a break to enjoy the story for a second? I legitimately wanted nothing to do with any of these characters, and whenever someone would die, I seriously wouldn't care.In conclusion, Romeo and Juliet is a dry toerag of a book with no personality and a boring plot. I guess it does kind of teach a lesson...don't commit suicide for a man you just met. I'm sorry, I just can't stand behind dusty old classics that I can't understand, which therefore have no meaning to me. "aNdReA, yOu'Re YoUnG...ToO yOuNg tO UnDeRsTaNd tHeSe dEeP MeAnInGs...iT'S a BriLlIaNt BoOk...". Thank you very much, I don't think anyone with a perfectly functioning brain should be forced to like a book with outdated themes and language that they can't understand.
4780916300	Reading Shakespeare is up there with cooking cutlets. It is work but worth it in the end. Romeo and Juliet is no exception. The language is such a bother. Look up too much and its pleasures wear thin. Too thin and, like cutlets, readers get burnt. They don't want to try again. This would be a shame. Like some other first times, it's worth another go. That language will still be there, same as the steering wheel and seat belts getting in the way of high school passions when parked by the beach wall. Best to ignore what gets in the way. Then you can persevere. A compact car can't turn into a van for our pleasure. But with practice we can become more adept with our kisses. The modern reader can adapt to Shakespeare the same way.Keep telling yourself what really matters when reading this play. It is about the love between two beautiful kids.
179476210	روميو وجولييت أصبت بحالة جفاف كتابي الأسبوع الماضي، صرت اتجنب الجلوس للكتابة، أؤجلها كل يوم إلى اليوم الذي يليه، أفسر هذه الحالة عندما تأتي بأنها قلق داخلي سببته مواقف صغيرة متفرقة، تجمعت معاً فصارت سداً أمام المزاج المؤاتي الذي يجعلك تكتب. وها أنا الآن يوم بعد الفالانتاين – حيث يفترض أن العشاق حول العالم تبادلوا الهدايا والوعود -، أجلس لأكتب عن الحب، لأكتب عن روميو وجولييت، قصة الحب الأشهر، صحيح أنه لكل ثقافة قصة عشق تغنيها، ولكن روميو وجولييت اكتسبت القوة الدافعة للحضارة الغربية، فصارت قصة العشق الأشهر. نادراً ما ترضيني قصة حب، اعتدت على اعتبار كل قصص الحب التي اقرؤها ناقصة أو سخيفة، ربما لكم العواطف التي تهرق فيها بطريقة اكتئابية !! ربما لأن قصص الحب تكتب كعاصفة وتنتهي كسيل جارف، وربما لأن رأسي يسقط عند أقدامي عندما اقرأ حباً، ولم أجد من يعيده إلى مكانه. قصة الحب الأجمل لم تكتب بعد، سنقرأ مئات قصص الحب المتشابهة، سنذوق ملوحة الدموع، وسنقاسي برد الليالي المسهدة، سنفتن بمشاهد الوصال التي يبدع الكتاب في سبكها على مشهد القمر، أو تحت وابل المطر، أو حتى في مقبرة موحشة، فحرارة الحب تطرد الحزن والخوف، تلغي المشهد الخارجي لتفجر عالماً داخلياً لا يسهل رصده. ترد إلى ذهني الآن وأنا اكتب على غير هدى، قصة حب شعبية، من القصص التي كان العرب يتداولونها رواية وشعراً، والتي كان مسرحها الأعظم خيامهم الباهتة اللون، في تلك القصة يلتقي حبيب بحبيبته بعدما شارفا على الموت، حتى تدخل صديق العاشق ودبر لهما لقاءً، وليشغل وجوه القبيلة عن الرجل الذي تسلل لملاقاة فتاتهم، وفد الصديق على القوم وجعل يشاغلهم بالقصص والحكايات، وفي الطرف الآخر البعيد من الخيمة، كانا العاشقان يتحدثان همساً، يضعان في لحظة كل اللحظات الماضية والتي ستأتي، وكانت العاشقة من فرط الحب والخوف، تتحدث بيديها ملوحة مع كلمة لتمنحها في الظلام صدقاً أكبر، فتصدر خلاخيلها صوت لا ينفذ إلى سمع العاشقين المذهول، ولكن نسائم الصيف تحمله إلى الرجال المتجمعين حول النار والحكايات، فبدأ والد الفتاة يتقلقل ويفكر بالذهاب إلى الداخل لإسكات هذه الخلاخل التي اقتحمت مجلس الرجال، عندها انتبه الصديق للكارثة القادمة، فافتتح حكاية جديدة بأن سألهم هل تعرفون فلان، وسمى لهم صديقه العاشق، قالوا نعم، وامتدحوه بما يعرفونه، فقال الصديق كانت لي مع فلان حكاية طريفة، تسابقنا أنا وإياه مرة على فرسين، فكاد أن يسبقني، ولكني تحايلت عليه فجعلت أصرخ "يدها يا فلان، يدها يافلان"، فظن أن يد فرسه قد علقت بشيء، فتوقف وكسبت أنا السباق، ضحك القوم، أما صوت الخلاخيل فتوقف، فيد العاشق امتدت وأمسكت يد معشوقته، بعدما وصله الإنذار الصارخ، بأنه قد لا يخسر السباق هذه المرة وإنما رأسه. وهكذا يبدو أن قصة الحب لا تكون عظيمة، إلا عندما يحيط بها ألف رجل متحفز، بسيوف وبنادق تكفي لاحتلال مدينة، ولكنها لا تكفي لترد عاشقاً، قصة الحب كما يعرف كل من يريد كتابتها، لا يمكن أن تأتي مباشرة، حب النظرة الأولى يبدو أنه سينقرض، ليأتي مكانه كره النظرة الأولى الذي ينقلب عشقاً فيما بعد كما حدث لبينيت ودارسي في (كبرياء وتحامل)، بل حتى من يلجئون لحب النظرة الأولى صاروا يعقدونه بإضفاء ماضٍ من النساء للعاشق، يتخلص منه عندما تغزو قلبه فتاة مختلفة. في هذه المسرحية استخدم شكسبير هذه الحيلة، فروميو يفتتح المسرحية بتأوهات عشق، لا لجولييت، فهو لا يعرفها بعد، وإنما لقريبة لها تدعى (روزالين)، إن من لا يعرف القصة ويقرأ كلمات روميو العشقية، يشعر بأنه لا يمكن أن يتزحزح عن هذا الحب، ويحلل الدكتور عناني في مقدمته لهذا العمل – وقراءة هذه المسرحية بترجمة غير ترجمة عناني هي ببساطة خطأ لا يغتفر – كلمات وأسلوب روميو في المسرحية قبل لقائه بجولييت، وكلماته وأسلوبه بعدها ليخلص إلى أن الحب الحقيقي الذي شعر به تجاه جولييت غيره تماماً، لقد نسخه وأعاده رجلاً جديداً. تدور أحداث القصة في مدينة فيرونا، حيث عائلتي مونتاجيو وكابيوليت المتصارعتين، روميو ابن لمونتاجيو، وجولييت بنت لكابيوليت، يتسلل روميو مع صديقيه ذات ليلة إلى حفلة تقام في منزله غرمائه، عله يرى حبيبته (روزالين) – وحتى لا نشعر بالأسف عليها، يجب أن نعرف أنها لا تهتم بروميو، ربما لأنها لا تشعر بصدق مشاعره نحوها -، ولكنه يرى بدلاً منها جولييت، وهنا تحدث لحظة الحب بينهما، يغادر روميو الحفل ولكنه يعود في ذات الليلة إلى منزل كابيوليت ليقف تحت شرفة جولييت في المشهد الشهير الذي استنسخ مراراً، يتواعد الاثنان على الحب والزواج، وبالفعل يتزوجان سراً في اليوم التالي، يزوجهما القس لورنس عل هذا الزواج يصلح ما بين العائلتين. تيبالت – ابن عم جولييت - الغاضب دائماً يبحث عن روميو ليقاتله، بعدما رآه متسللاً إلى حفل الكابيوليت في الليلة الفائتة، ولكن روميو المنتشي بالحب يرفض مقاتلة تيبالت لأنه صار صهره ولو لم يكن يعلم، عندها يتدخل صديق روميو ويقاتل تيبالت، يحاول روميو وقف القتال ولكنه بالخطأ يمنح تيبالت فرصة يطعن بها صديق روميو طعنة قاتلة، عندها ينتقم روميو بقتل تيبالت. ينفى روميو من فيرونا، فيغادرها بعدما يودع جولييت التي تواجه إلى جانب فراق الحبيب، ضغطاً قاسياً من والدها لتزويجها للدوق باريس أحد أقاربهم، تحاول جولييت مقاومة هذا الزواج بشتى الطرق، ولكن والدها ينفجر غضباً، فتذهب للقس ليساعدها، فيعطيها مخدراً لتتناوله ليلة الزفاف بحيث يجعلها تبدو كالميتة لعدة ساعات، ويعدها بأنه سيرسل رسولاً إلى روميو ليستدعيها بحيث أنها عندما تستيقظ ستجد روميو عندها. تتناول جولييت المخدر ليلة الزواج، وتجري الأمور كما خطط لها، لولا أن الرسول لم يصل إلى روميو، وإنما وصله خبر وفاة حبيبته، يجن روميو عندها فيشتري سماً ويعود إلى فيرونا، وفي المقبرة حيث ذهب ليتجرع السم على تابوت حبيبته وليموت معها تحدث المأساة، فباريس العريس المكسور القلب يظن أن روميو متعدٍ على القبور جاء ليدنس قبر عروسه، فيتقاتلان ليموت باريس، يتناول بعدها روميو السم ويموت، لتصحو جولييت من موتتها الوهمية، فتجد من حولها الخراب والجثث، عندها تطعن نفسها بخنجر وتموت، هكذا يسدل الستار على كل هذا الموت، لم يعش الحب في هذه القصة طويلاً، ولكنه جاء عاصفاً، له رائحة الموت، ومشهد الدماء، ليست كل قصص الحب بهذه الدموية، ولكن يبدو أن قصص الحب التي لا يموت أبطالها، يموت ذكرها.image: لوحة فريدريك لايتون (1855)

3531836093	YouTube kitap kanalımda Shakespeare'in hayatı, mutlaka okunması gereken kitapları ve kronolojik okuma sırası hakkında bilgi edinebilirsiniz: https://youtu.be/rGxh2RVjmNURomeo ve Juliet, Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth ve Kral Lear gibi oyunların yazarı olan Shakespeare’in esas adı Şeyh Pir miydi ve gizli bir Müslüman mıydı? Hamlet'teki "To be or not to be" kısmının gerçek hali acaba "Töv be or not töv be" şeklinde miydi? Yoksa Shakespeare diye biri hiç yaşamadı mı?Bu tür gerçekdışı iddialardan kurtulmanız için hazırladığım bu inceleme, aslında oldukça detaylı ve yeterli bir okuma rehberi olacak. Çünkü Shakespeare'den okuduğum 42 adet kitabı herkesin okumaya zamanı olmayacağını bildiğim için ben de en önemli bulduğum kitaplar konusunda bir okuma rehberi incelemesi yapacağım. Öncelikle Shakespeare diye biri hiç yaşadı mı? Mina Urgan'ın Shakespeare ve Hamlet kitabında Shakespeare'in aslında kim olduğuna dair bugüne kadar şu isimlerin ortaya atıldığı söylenmiş: Francis Bacon, Earl of Southampton, Lord Rutland, Sir Walter Raleigh, Earl of Derby, Earl of Oxford, Christopher Marlowe. Shakespeare diye birinin hiç yaşamadığını, onun esasında Francis Bacon olduğunu söyleyenler konusunda ise şöyle diyor Mina Urgan:"Bu tür iddiaları ileri sürenlerin ya bilgisiz ya şarlatan ya da delirmiş olduklarını kabul etmek zorundayız." (s. 31)Mina Urgan'ın dediği gibi biri olmak istemiyorsanız bir de biyografi yazarı Park Honan'ın Shakespeare: Bir Yaşam biyografi kitabında William Shakespeare'in tapularından arazilerine, oynattığı tiyatrolardan bağlı olduğu tiyatro kumpanyalarına, arkadaşlarından oynattığı oyunculara, eşlerinden çocuklarına kadar olan bütün bilgiyi görebilirsiniz.Ayrıca Shakespeare neredeyse her oyunu için bir kaynaktan ya da eski bir hikayeden beslenmiştir fakat kitaplarına kendi Shakespeare özünü her zaman katabildiği için gerek çevirmen ve tiyatrobilimci Özdemir Nutku'nun onun için yazdığı önsözlerde gerekse de Shakespeare için yazılmış biyografi kitaplarında onun bu eserleri nasıl tekrar ele alıp kendi dönemine ve kişiliğine de özgün bir şekilde uyguladığını anlayabiliriz. Romeo ve Juliet kitabı hakkında da çok küçük bir şey söyleyecek olursam, karanlık ve aydınlık, zamanın yavaş geçmesiyle hızlı geçmesi, aşk ve nefret, iyilik ve kötülük gibi zıtlıkların mücadelesinin olduğu bir atmosferde toy, bilinçsiz ve masum bir aşk anlatılırken mesela Shakespeare, olgunluk dönemi eserlerinden biri olan Antonius ve Kleopatra eserinde de siyasi karışıklıklar içerisinde daha detaylı, olgunca ve zor bir aşkı anlatıyor. Böylece Romeo ve Juliet bize hem erken dönem Shakespeare hakkında tüyolar veriyor hem de ileride kullanacağı psikolojik çözümlemeleri hangi kitaplarında ilk olarak denemeye başladığını söylüyor.Romeo ve Juliet'in bize demeye çalıştığı şey de aslında şu: Aileleriniz sizin aşkınızı hiç istemese de bazen aşk uğruna ölmeye bile değerdir, çünkü en azından kendiniz için haklı bir mücadele uğruna ölmüşsünüzdür ve gözünüz arkada kalmamıştır. Ne Romeo Romeoluğundan ödün vermiştir, ne de Juliet Julietliğinden...----------------------------------------Bu kadar şey dedikten sonra sıra Shakespeare'in bütün kitaplarını okuduğum için önermeye hakkımın ve deneyimimin olduğunu düşündüğüm okuma rehberi kısmına gelsin.Bütün kitaplarını okumayayım ama Oğuz Aktürk'ün en önemli bulduğu kitapları okuyayım sırası:- Özdemir Nutku, Dram Sanatı (Tiyatro konusunda bir başlangıç bilgisi elde etmenizi sağlar.)- Alfa Yayınları, Shakespeare Kitabı (Okumalarınız sırasında kronolojik bir sıra takip etmek istiyorsanız bu kitabı bölüm bölüm takip edebilirsiniz.)- Hırçın Kız- Titus Andronicus- Aşk ve Anlatı Şiirleri- Romeo ve Juliet- Venedik Taciri + Olmak ya da Olmamak filmi (1942) ile Piyanist filmi (2002)- Kral IV. Henry 1-2- Windsor'un Şen Kadınları- Julius Caesar- Hamlet- Soneler- Othello- Kral Lear + Kurosawa'nın Ran filmi (1985)- Macbeth + Yumuşak Kalpler filmi (1949)- Antonius ve Kleopatra- Coriolanus'un Tragedyası- Shakespeare için yazılmış biyografi kitaplarından en az 1 tanesi (Mesela bütün kitaplar okunduktan sonra Mina Urgan'ın Shakespeare ve Hamlet kitabını okumak gayet yeterli olur)Böyle bir okuma sırası önermemin sebebi ise hem Hırçın Kız, Titus Andronicus ve Romeo ve Juliet gibi serbest dönem eserlerini tanıyacak olmanız hem Shakespeare'in yükselmeye başladığı dönem olan I. Elizabeth dönemi içinde yazılmış Venedik Taciri, Julius Caesar, Hamlet gibi eserleri okuyabilecek olmanız hem de olgunluk dönemi olan I. James dönemi içinde yazılmış Othello, Kral Lear, Macbeth ile Antoinus ve Kleopatra gibi eserlerle tanışma fırsatınızın olması. Yani 42 kitaplık Shakespeare külliyatının tadını 15 kitap şeklinde okuyarak da alabilirsiniz diye düşünüyorum.----------------------------------------Ama eğer ki kronolojik sırayla bütün kitapları okumak istiyorsanız:Veronalı İki Soylu DelikanlıHırçın KızAşk ve Anlatı ŞiirleriII.

121040288	I was in the staff room a couple of weeks ago. Obviously, I stand out from the other student teachers. In fact, given I’m nearly 50 and male and they are nearly 25 and female, I imagine I look like one of those incredibly sad men that react to mid-life in ways other than looking for a new career.Anyway, one of the teachers (a retired man who works covering absent teachers and seems to be there every day) asked me what I did before becoming a student teacher and then why in God’s name I would ever want to be a teacher instead. You know, high stress, low pay, crazy kids – the list of features is nearly endless.I told him that in my previous job I had all that too, the kids were just older (well, the pay was better too, admittedly) but the other main feature of my previous job was getting to read the same enterprise agreement over and over again for 8 years straight without remission. It was like the myth of Sisyphus without the interest of seeing the amusing ploy the Gods would come up with this time to mess things up right at the end. At least this way, I told him, I would be reading and re-reading Shakespeare, and that has got to be an improvement. Cute line, but would it hold up?And so my new journey began right away by having to read and teach this little play to a group of 16 year olds. I’ve never studied this play before. I have read it, but I’ve learnt that to teach something ‘reading it’ once isn’t really quite enough. I wouldn’t have said I knew everything about the play before I started teaching it, but I wasn’t quite prepared to learn some of the things about the play that I did. Take this little sonnet as a case in point. I can’t begin to tell you what finding it has done for my regard for my mate Bill. If I profane with my unworthiest handThis holy shrine, the gentle sin in this,My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready standTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too muchWhich mannerly devotion shows in this.For saints have hands that pilgrim’s hands do touch,And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?Ay, pilgrim, lips that thy must use in pray’r.Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do,They pray – grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.Saints do not move, though grant for prayer’s sake.Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.Now, as you know, a sonnet is like a little song, it has 14 lines, ten syllables per line, alternating stressed and unstressed syllables and rhymes ababcdcdefefgg. But this isn’t like the sonnet that begins this play – this sonnet is hidden in the dialogue and is spoken Romeo and Juliet together built from their dialogue in an incredibly important scene in the play. It is their very first words together and the sonnet ends in their very first kiss.How sexy is that? Imagine thinking of having your main characters’ first words together as a sonnet. God, it makes my head spin.So, the options before me were to read yet another maternity leave clause or to read and re-read Romeo and Juliet for the next twenty years. There really wasn’t a lot of choice, was there?
1127792955	I read this in 8th grade English class. We had to read this out loud. After we read it, we watched the black and white movie of the same and the teacher had blacked out the morning after coitus scene since they showed his butt. I mean, butts are so salacious, right? Anyway, small town politics. It was my first introduction into Shakespeare and the language was difficult. I didn't have the vocabulary skills yet to appreciate it. Plus, we had tons of vocab words to go with it. I eventually saw the play live and feel in love with it. I re-read this during my great Shakespeare read where I read all his plays and enjoyed it so much more then. I think we all know the story of star crossed lovers. It's used all the time now in stories. Do you think Shakespeare was saying that the only kind of true love is the one where you die before it ends? How come true love is a tragedy and not a comedy. It's starts out lite enough. I used to think this was so romantic and now I see that it's the lust, puppy love, and romantic notions of children. It's the thing that happens before you really fall in love with someone as mature people. It's seems a whim, their first real crush. It also shows how fickle Romeo is. He was in love with Rosalind and all it took was a gaze across a room at Juliet and she was forgotten. Would that have happened to Juliet later? I think most likely. Who knows, maybe this is real love, but real love endures hardships. Still, I enjoy this play up until act 5 when it gets so serious. I love to see that first love play out. The love scenes are so tender and doesn't it remind us all what that first love felt like.This is not my favorite Shakespeare. I love his comedies and we never studied those in school. Of his tragedies, this is my favorite, certainly. He captures first love so well.
4543845149	You know, there actually isn't anything bad about this book, but rather how badly it is taught in public high school.
2153321051	Well, this has always been one of my least favorite Shakespearean tragedies. I suppose I've always felt that Shakespeare depends mostly on performance; it's not meant to be read until it's been seen at least once. And though I've seen one movie adaptation of this play as a child, I don't think I've seen quite enough to form an opinion. So instead of reading this in full, I listened on audiobook. And you know what? I think it wasn't enough. I think I needed to see this again before listening to it. Moreover, I think this is a play generally better seen than performed. While the language is beautiful, the emotionality of this play comes primarily from seeing these two young lovers - dumb, yes, but in love - kill themselves for what they believe. When reading this, it's simply something happening, something far away and removed. When you see it - really see it, see them gasping, see them desperate and upset - it's a call to action. Romeo and Juliet is, at its core, not a play about two lovers. It is a play about how prejudice and hate can destroy the happiness of two innocents. Reducing it to "they were stupid" is missing the point. They were stupid. But if not for the hate of their families, the feud that had been destroying their family for generations, they would have survived. Dumb, yes, but they would not have died if not for the hate of generations past. I really don't have much else to say: the language used in this play is gorgeous, of course, but among Shakespeare's tragedies, the characters don't speak to me on quite the level others do. Yet I think this play has the potential to be fantastic if seen live with talented actors. It's a play that will chiefly depend on its performances, but I think it's a play worth seeing if you get the chance. #BAZ LURHMANN MOVIE REVIEW Can I just say: this movie adaptation is completely wild. The cinematography is weird, and wild, and completely all over the place on purpose, as Lurhmann often does. The setting of the balcony scene is wonderful and beautifully done; I'm a huge fan of everything about the opening scene, which is so tonally odd that it sets a perfect tone for the show. I actually think the Mercutio performance in this one is my favorite; several of the other characters are just a little bit flat, although well-cast to emphasize the youth of the characters. #AUDIOBOOK PERFORMANCE REVIEW I liked Calista Flockhart's performance; while I felt she went too breathy at parts and didn't add the proper layer of characterization underneath all the innocence, I felt her intonation conveyed her feelings quite well. Unfortunately, I felt myself hard-pressed to truly believe in Matthew Wolf's performance. His intonation spoke to me of lust, not of true love. The only moment where I genuinely loved his character was in the final poisoning scene; I was left near tears during his final monologue, the only moment I truly felt strongly during the play.

4282087762	A double-edged sword. The original enemies to lovers, and the original miscommunication trope, all in one.
6183144242	❝From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.❞⊹₊♡⋆.ೃ࿔*:･જ*⁀➷SummaryRomeo and Juliet is a tragic play written by William Shakespeare. It follows the story of young lovers Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, who come from feuding families in Verona, Italy. Despite their families' hatred towards each other, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, but their love is doomed to a tragic end.*ﾟ⁀➴ThemeThe impulsive decisions driven by passion and emotion can be dangerous.Love overcomes social and familial boundaries."O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I’ll no longer be a Capulet."જ*⁀➷CharactersRomeo🙄Wow. He was NOTHING like I expected at all. I thought he would be charming, romantic, and smart, but he was seriously lacking in all of those departments. Instead, he was obsessive, impulsive, and terribly slow. (view spoiler)[The fact that he was so painfully in love with Rosaline in the beginning then switched up AS SOON AS he saw Juliet is crazy to me. (hide spoiler)] I had very high expectations for him, but it was very obvious from the first scene he was in that he would be nothing like I thought he would."What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight?...O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear—Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!""Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off." 😳 I- WHAT? (view spoiler)[vestal livery is referring to Juliet's virginity (hide spoiler)]Juliet🤨Shakespeare did Juliet so dirty. She was so young and innocent throughout this whole book and some of the things she was exposed to were just wild. There wasn't much to know about Juliet besides how quick she was to fall in love."Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,And I'll believe thee."Mercutio🥰Mercutio is absolutely the best side character ever!! He's extremely funny and impulsive but in a good way! *cough* Romeo *cough* (view spoiler)[I almost cried when Tybalt murdered him 😭 (hide spoiler)]"The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.-I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,"😈"No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten pie-that is, something stale and hoar ere it be spent." 😭Tybalt🖕🏼He could go die for all I care. (view spoiler)[And he did-the only good thing Romeo did.🥰 (hide spoiler)]Benvolio😚Aww, he was so sweet and kind, and I really liked him!!Friar Lawrence🧐IT'S HIM! I found the reason why Romeo and Juliet's story ended with tragedy!! He was soooo annoying and stupid. It was such a pain to read about him.Angelica (The Nurse)Hilarious that we only found out her name in Act 4 lmaoo. Other than that, I don't really care for her character at all.જ*⁀➷PlotSurprisingly, I actually really enjoyed the story line of this book! It had a good pace, interesting events, and wild plot twists. The only complaint I would really have with this book is it's annoying interesting characters. (Except ml Mercutio)જ*⁀➷RecommendationI recommend you read this book if you like stories with interesting plots, classic books, and wild characters.જ*⁀➷RatingCharacters: 3/5⭐Plot: 5/5⭐ Ending: 4/5⭐Extra Stars For Mercutio: 5/5⭐Overall: 4.5/5🌟 (Rounded up)⊹₊♡⋆.ೃ࿔*:･❝A glooming peace this morning with it brings. The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; Some shall be pardoned, and some punishèd; For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.❞⊹₊♡⋆.ೃ࿔*:･
220869899	Shakespeare writes beautifully, but that does not save this mushy tale. I had seen countless versions in Indian movies before I actually read it.The Romantic Age This one is entering her teens, Ripe for sentimental scenes, Has picked a gangling unripe male, Sees herself in a bridal veil, Presses lips and tosses head, Declares she's not too young to wed, Informs you pertly you forget Romeo and Juliet. Do not argue, do not shout; Remind her how that one turned out. - Ogden Nash Exactly!
758892633	I'm going to make this simple... Conclusion
5547647024	Really well written, with annotations, summaries and helpful guides which really help the reader understand the text. I would really recommend for anyone studying their GCSE’s or anyone trying to help someone revise for their GCSE’s. I personally wouldn’t ever read these guides just to read the book if that makes sense as the annotations and notes do ruin the flow of the read slightly! But does exactly what it says on the tin!

225173489	In an era of divisiveness (political, religious, racial, ethnic, Coke v. Pepsi, people who like dogs v. people who don't like dogs, etc.), which, let's be honest, is every single era in history, William Shakespeare's "Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet" will always be relevant.This is still, probably, my favorite play of the Bard, and I've read all of them, numerous times.* I learned long ago not to view this as a love story. It's not. Hint: the title gives it away. (And before you scratch your head in confusion after looking at the title, keep in mind that Shakespeare's original and lengthier title was "The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet", not "The Romantic Love Story of Romeo and Juliet", nor "The Hilarious Romantic Comedic Misadventures of Romeo and Juliet" ) If anything, this is a tragic story of the deadly consequences that divisiveness of any kind has upon subsequent generations.Romeo and Juliet were just two likable teenagers who, unfortunately for them, ended up in a relationship with the only two people that they should not have ended up in a relationship with. And it killed them.I also learned long ago that it's stupid and pointless to judge these two based on the fact that they were stupid teenagers who weren't so much in love as in lust. It's true, but it doesn't make their story any less tragic.*Not necessarily a true statement. I've read a lot of the Bard's plays, but I can't honestly say I've read them all. That's just braggadocio.
2135084895	"JULIETA: ¿Crees que volveremos a encontrarnos?ROMEO: Sin duda, y estas penas servirán en el futuro para dulces charlas.JULIETA: ¡Oh, Dios! ¡Mi alma presiente tantos males!"Aunque había leído algunos fragmentos es la primera vez que leo la obra completa y fue motivado luego de ver una excelente adaptación infantil en un teatro de aquí de Lima. Debo confesar que decepcionado por los parlamentos románticos, son pocos y no tan elocuentes. El clímax alegre así mismo pobremente relatado. Y más bien mucho espacio utilizado en parlamentos cómicos (como es clásico en el teatro de la época) y otros hechos triviales. Sin embargo el final tuvo más impacto que el que vi en la representación, por obvias razones. El final es contundente y me gustó mucho. Y la historia de Romeo y Julieta es en sí misma un clásico de relación romántica más allá de todo idioma y continente.Luego de leer esta obra me pregunto la gran disparidad de valoraciones morales de aquella época y creo como siempre lo he hecho que las obras deben ser valoradas en su contexto y en el aporte de la humanidad, de otra manera, esta obra sería crucificada por el grado de misoginia que contiene.
4864809124	Note finale : 5/5Wow, la claque.Bon, d'abord, je n'ai pas lu la version que je note actuellement. Ou plus précisément, j'ai essayé de la lire, j'avais l'impression qu'elle était surtraduite donc je suis allé chercher le texte original et je suis tombé sur le site litcharts.com qui propose le texte original accompagné d'une "traduction" en anglais moderne. Et dans l'ordre, la version que je comprenais le mieux était celle en anglais moderne, puis celle de Shakespeare, puis la traduction française d'Yves Bonnefoy. J'ai donc surtout lu la version en anglais moderne. Et, une fois que le sens était clair, je lisais le texte de Shakespeare (soit en diagonale, soit plusieurs dizaines de fois).Parce que oui, j'ai retrouvé chez Roméo et Juliette quelque chose que je n'avais plus ressenti depuis la lecture de Cyrano de Bergerac : l'envie de relire et relire et relire des passages pour m'en imprégner, pour m'approprier leur élégance, leur simplicité et leur force. J'ai noté sept scènes particulièrement magistrales dans leur écriture, sept scènes que j'ai envie d'encadrer pour ne jamais les oublier. La rencontre entre Roméo et Juliette et leur sonnet sur les lèvres et les mains, évidemment la scène du balcon, le mariage de Roméo et Juliette (acte II, scène 6), les meurtres de Mercutio et Tybalt, Juliette qui prétend être malheureuse pour son cousin alors qu'elle est triste que Roméo soit banni (Acte III, scène 2), le dernier dialogue entre Juliette et Roméo (Acte III, scène 5), et bien sûr la dernière scène de la pièce.Absolument magistral. Quand j'ai lu Hamlet, j'ai senti le génie de Shakespeare mais aussi que je passais à côté. Là, je l'ai pris en pleine face. Et c'est un plaisir de lecture assez rare.
2318922589	Read it when I was in school, Romeo and Juliet - my first ever love story. At that time I didn’t understand it much but now it makes sense that how hatred among families can result in death of lovers. A sad story indeed.Blog | YouTube | Instagram | Facebook | LinkedIn
868788783	2.5/5. This book wasn't for me. I knew what I was getting into but I had no choice. I had to read it for school, and every single scene was a struggle. The characters made the worst decisions and then wrote it off as being "young". Have to say that this play was a disappointment, I absolutely loved Hamlet. But Romeo and Juliet just fell flat for me. Full review to come.
