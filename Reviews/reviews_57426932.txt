4284255243	This is the worst book I've ever read. I know I keep making little edits to this review here and there but it's just because it's been more than two years since I read this and I still think about how bad it is at least once a week. If I could unread one book in my life, it would be Gothikana. Video review on my TikTok here.The concept of Gothikana is almost interesting and maybe had some potential to be a good Gothic Romance, but the execution just isn't there. 2 Stars. Edit: after taking a couple days to think about this, I'm dropping it to a 1.5. This book is terrible. Edit January 2023: I'm just seeing this review again and I can't believe I ever gave it 1.5 stars, much less 2. Maybe I was trying to be nice? I'm much more confident in the way I rate and review now and this book, for me, is the reason 1 star reviews exist. 15 months later I still think about how bad this book was all the time.There are three areas where this book seriously falls apart: the writing style, the complete lack of editing, and the actual story.Writing Style:The writing is heinous. It is nearly impossible to believe an actual grown adult wrote any of this. It reads like a bad fanfiction written by a thirteen year old, and I'm not just going to say that and move on, I'm including a passage from the book below. I found myself reading slower because I was actively re-writing lines in my head to make it flow more seamlessly, fix improper word usage, and generally just sound better. This passage is a pretty good indicator of the style throughout the book: "Dr. Kari was one of her scariest professors in the semester. He had down tilted dark eyes and a fierce white beard, and he was strict. One time a girl got late to the class and he made her stand outside in the corridor in full view until she had gone red in the face from humiliation. Students were scared to ask him a question. But it didn't end there. He also seemed to enjoy looking at young girls too much in the class, all eighteen-year-old first-years except an older Corvina." A couple more: "Corvina felt sick not just with the night but with the story, thinking about a man in a situation she was as a woman forced him. It was absolutely disgusting. No, you don't have a concussion. You're not reading that wrong and I didn't type it wrong. Look at the video I linked above where I include a picture of this passage in the book to prove this is actually how it was written. "Corvina leaned against the wall for support, a glass of drink in her hand... Mmm, my favorite, a glass of drink.I could go on for pages and pages about how bad the writing is, but I think you get it.Editing (or lack thereof):2024 Edit: This book was picked up by Tor's new imprint Bramble for traditional publication and released a couple months ago. To this end, from quickly flipping through the Bramble edition in the bookstore it appears that the book mostly got a quick pass for copy editing, rendering this specfic section on editing potentially moot for the current version. The writing style and story appear to have remained largely the same save for the most egregious technical mistakes. For example, the first block of text I included above is nearly identical, having only changed one word and one comma if I recall correctly. The following note on the complete lack of editing pertains to the book as it was published and as I purchased and read it in 2021. That version of the book being what prompted a six-figure book deal for it to be trad published by a Big 5 is genuinely a bad omen for this industry. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, my friends. This book wasn't edited or proofread at all. The author clearly didn't even bother to run spell check, which is where I admittedly start to lose my patience with a book. It's annoying, as a reader, to think about the fact that I paid X amount of dollars for a book the author couldn't be arsed to comb for spelling errors. I completely understand that things get missed, but it's excessive in Gothikana. Chapter breaks occasionally have special art pages with famous quotes, and you'd think a copy and paste quote would be safe from spelling errors...but you'd be wrong. Gothikana is chock-full of misspelled words, incorrect word usage (i.e. "compatible" where she meant "companionable," among a multitude of other instances), constant misuse of punctuation, run-on sentences and sentence fragments abound, and missing movement in the writing (a character moving from one place to another in a scene seemingly by teleporting since the writing never indicated movement, which actually creates a big problem in the climactic scene of the book). If you get twitchy at unedited books, this will be completely unreadable.((Edit: In talking with someone who's reading the ebook, it sounds like the digital version may have been slightly edited/updated. The paperbacks being sold have definitely not received the same treatment. This is embarrassing.))The Story:As for the story itself, I understand that this is much more subjective but it didn't work for me either. Even beyond the technical aspects of the writing, there's just a lot that doesn't make sense in the story. From the fact that it's a modern university full of adults who are told they can't leave or use the one single phone on campus without express permission from faculty (the author clearly wanted to have that isolated gothic vibe without bothering to give a single solitary thought to the logistics of how to narratively create that feeling and actually make it worthwhile in the story), to a psychiatrist telling a girl with a history of schizophrenia from BOTH parents that the voices she hears in her head aren't a problem...I spent a lot of the book saying[For anyone reading on mobile it's that meme of the old lady saying "that's not how any of this works!"]None of that even covers the massive amount of plot holes and narrative threads that are started and then abandoned with no resolution. It's like the author started with a desire for an attempt at a cohesive plot and just gave up entirely about halfway through, then made it to the end and realized they didn't have answers for any of the questions they themselves created, and so tried to make it seem like the total lack of an ending was intentional. The book legitimately goes from the climactic scene straight to an epilogue with a time jump. You want answers to questions posed by the beginning of the story? Too bad, you're not getting any.Overall I found pacing to be poor, the romance was extremely underdeveloped, and while the plot maybe had some interesting potential at its base foundation, it all just completely falls apart before it even gets going. It reads like the author didn't know how to finish the book so there's no resolution for anything and it gets a meta ending that was never earned. Props for at least starting with a plot that I wanted to be invested in, but literally none of it was done well.I would have DNFd this book very early on if I didn't have a self-imposed policy about finishing a book once I start it.Edit February 2025 because I guess this is a yearly thing at this point: This still remains the worst book I've ever read in my entire life by a huge margin.
5003381512	this book changed my brain chemistry…i didn’t know i heavily needed a dark academic, gothic romance until i read the first few pages of this book. it scratched an itch so deep inside my mind..idk what’s real anymore. Corvina is such a badass character omg i love her! And Vad?! ughh i want him so bad it’s not even funny 😩 they are such an iconic duo and the ending omggg 🤧🤧🤧i’m in love with themthough this book does follow their romance it also follows this underlying mystery of strange disappearances, murders, and random suicides. and the way that shit was unpacked before my eyes at the very end…could not have predicted that shit..no fucking waymultiple times i catch myself smiling and squealing at this book at random times. to say i am shocked and disgusted is an understatement. i deserve to be euthanized honestly.
4555053410	I'm sorry but if a man told me "I'm your madness" mid-fucking, I would laugh so hard, his dick would snap.
4638795405	Not me acting surprised when the weird smutty gothic book is actually a weird smutty book 👁👄👁
4820486010	DNFed halfway through I don’t usually rate/review books I don’t finish but this is genuinely the worst book I’ve ever read - which I don’t say lightly. Usually I’ll never say outright “don’t read this book” but my god. I have never been so baffled as to how this has so many high ratings. This book is clearly just here for the aesthetics, an angsty romance on a “dark academia” backdrop - or an attempt at one. The first few pages initially impressed me for its pretty gothic designs, a playlist, map, the full shebang. But lo and behold, it seems more energy was put into the design of the book that it’s contents, for it was riddled with errors and clearly needed an editor. Being self published I could let the occasional typo slide, but when the fourth one I came across was a misspelling of the word “happy” on a page with a whole seven words in total on it, in a huge graphic design quote…that just made me think the author hadn’t even bothered to read it through either. So why should I?Not only that, but the dark academia aesthetic it was apparently striving for was nowhere to be seen beyond needing a reason for all these characters to be in one building. The dialogue made me cringe so hard I physically recoiled, and what I assume was meant to be a steamy sex scene just read like a violation. So yeah, a DNF from me.
6467552573	i would give this negative stars if i could. This is the worst book I’ve ever read. That includes zodiac academy.This has no plot. The prose is terrible. The characters are terrible. The plot has plot holes and the author knows this and chooses to acknowledge them at the end and be like “yeah weird we don’t know who murdered (character name) right?”. I wish this had ended with Vad getting stabbed. Also you probably shouldn’t write schizophrenia the way this book depicts it. Here’s a video: GOTHIKANA is THE WORST BOOK I'VE READhttps://youtu.be/Fnqz8Wllo1k
4909435450	Ugh I am so mad rn because I wanted answers and I need them. A LOT OF THEM. If you want to read this book and expect to get answer about what happened then do not read this because you do not get them. I was so excited about this. The plot seemed great and the description of the castle was really nice and I wanted to get fully immersed in the story. The mystery also started off great and I was excited to read about it but we never get any answers which just made me extremely mad. It fell flat because of that especially because sooooo many things happen. We have the mystery of Corvina and why she is the way she is, the Thesis of Vad, the purple eyes, the ball, the disappearing of students, the witches, the rituals, the lake, the forest, the powder and nothing gets answered or just very broadly explained by saying it is because the mountain is magical. It made me hate the second part of this story especially when the characters full out said that some things don't have or need answers. Uh yes I do need answers that is why I am reading this???
6295080488	She had walked these lands of evil and marked them with love. This is clearly a case of it's me, not the book.I've been wanting to read more romantasy lately, so I picked up Gothikana on a whim without looking at it too carefully, drawn in by its Beauty and the Beast vibes. And it turned out to be a dark gothic romance with some hints of the paranormal. While there's nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't what I was hoping for.Right off the bat, this feels steeped in atmosphere. All the descriptions of turrets, gargoyles, flickering candles, and moonlit woods infused the story with a creepiness and gothic darkness that was hard to look away from. It felt like Beast's castle brought to life, just without the dancing accoutrements. Add to that the ghostly echoes and the school setting, and you have dark academia in spades.But as the story went on, it became clear that this was first and foremost a romance, and a fairly dramatic one at that. It suffers from so much insta-love and lust that I found it hard to take the coupling seriously. One moment they were giving each smoldering eyes, the next minute they were doing the deed everywhere, with so much overwrought explicitness I was cringing on the inside. It's never good when I'm embarrassed for the couple, and that's what happened here.The part I was looking forward to the most was the fantasy element, and it just never quite materialized to my satisfaction. I wanted primarily a fantasy with some romance to spice it up, and what I got instead was a romance with no real fantasy and a sprinkling of the paranormal. Without that fantasy element, I never quite connected with the story despite it being entertaining enough.Also, one other thing. Everywhere I look, everyone's agog over dark academia, but—and please don't throw rotten eggs at me for saying this—I just don't get the appeal. Just like how I wouldn't get excited about stories set in dark grocery stores, dark restaurants, or dark workplaces, I'm unable to muster up too much excitement for dark academia. Maybe it's because I only know of studious academia (the setting where I went to school), or maybe I just haven't read a good one yet. Either way, I'm pretty indifferent, and this book didn't change my mind.Since it's a clearly case of mismatched expectations, I can't really fault the book. I suspect many readers would enjoy the very things I take issues with, so don't let me dissuade you if this sounds like your thing. And if you're a fan of gothic romances and dark academia (whatever that is), definitely don't pass this up.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧
5237940191	how do i give this a zero im dead srs this was so bad it almost circled back around to being good because WHY WAS THIS FUNNY ASF DFGLKJDFLKseriously though i went into this pretty blind off the rec that it was a ~dark academia mystery~ a la ninth house/secret history… i think a more accurate comparison would be my immortal. this book has the frantic testosterone and finesse of a 17 year old boy and no joke is the worst book i have ever read. i will never be able to read the words “the woods” or “deep gravel voice” without it triggering a flashback Some highlights: a ~voice~ visiting our main character to whisper “he’s important vivi this one” (like a.. force ghost?) that appears in her head WHILE this man is fucking her in a car? him fingering her while she tells him about her schIZOPHRENIC MOTHER (??????) Constantly calling her his “little crow” ….like boy you are SO creepy and your “single grey streak” … you will never be stacy london honourable mention to “magic pussy”, “as though she hadn’t been wet with his seed” and “and if i am? does that make you loathe me? will that keep your pussy dry” being things i also read with my bare eyes. Like i get that smut is a genre in itself and while that's not what im into and did not go into this book expecting to see, i have to believe that i have an issue with this book not solely because it isn’t “my thing” but because this has to be an atrociously bad example of it… right? RIGHT????? Everything and i mean everything in this book is at its best awkward/corny or at its worst downright creepy. plotwise it was clear that anything that didn’t directly have to do with the romance was a heavy afterthought. at points it genuinely felt like satire it was getting so ridiculous, then decided to get META at the end to explain away the plot holes? META????????????????????????? consider me retired from booktok recommendations jesus christon a brighter note those ppl saying kindles make u read faster were NOT joking...
3855195150	Gothikana was one of my most anticipated reads of this year, and now, it's become one of my favorites! RuNyx did not disappoint in any capacity! Corvina Clemm and Vad Deverell are unlike any couple I've read before, and I loved every minute of their story! Corvina grew up in an unconventional manner raised and homeschooled by her schizophrenic mother that doesn't like people or to speak more than necessary. Throughout her childhood, she had only the crows, her books, and the voice in her head to keep her company. When an invitation to attend Verenmore arrives, it comes as a surprise... one she never expected would change her life. "𝑰𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒊𝒔 𝒎𝒂𝒅𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒔," 𝒔𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒔𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒂𝒍𝒎𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝒂𝒈𝒂𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒕 𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒑𝒔, "𝒅𝒓𝒐𝒘𝒏 𝒎𝒆 𝒊𝒏 𝒊𝒕." Suspense, steam, murder, mystery, forbidden love, a heroine with questionable mental stability, and a hero with questionable morals, it's like this book was written just for me! Everything from the atmosphere to the orgasms is utter perfection! It has a dark, eerie vibe that I couldn't get enough of, and Vad and Corvina are some of the most intriguing and unique characters I've ever read. Verenmore, a character in it's own right, is the exclusive university where Corvina attends and Vad teaches. It sits atop a secluded mountain, beautiful and terrifying with ghosts of the past haunting the halls and the woods on the castle grounds. This majestic setting and the secrets it holds made the story so much fun and created an ambience both romantic and downright creepy. Everything in this book is mysterious. It's written in such a way that you're constantly uncertain and completely captivated. The history of Verenmore, the voices, the shadows, the suicides, the supposed curse, the woods, the lake, a century of murders and disappearances, and even the main characters themselves keep you guessing the whole way through! This is the part of my review where I would normally start gushing over the characters and discussing the plot. However, I realized that everything else I have to say could possibly spoil something or take away from the overall experience of the story. Believe me, you don't want that! You owe it to yourself to experience this book in the way it was intended, and Vad and Corvina deserve no less! Spine-tingling, atmospheric, sexy, and macabre, Gothikana is gothic romance and dark academia in its finest form. It's a spooky smorgasbord of preternatural activity with surprises around every corner, and I sincerely hope Runyx gives us more of this world. Either way, she just got a brand new fan!
5329149806	you couldn’t pay me to believe this wasn’t wednesday addams x harry potter fan fictioni already don’t like teacher x student, which i didn’t know this was but that’s my fault for not reading the description. no matter how much the author wanted to age up the main character i feel like it doesn’t work because this college has the feeling of a high school. mainly because it’s literally hogwarts but whatever. i thought the main character was boring despite reminding me of wednesday addams (who i love) i found the teacher creepy from the start, he literally was a predator considering he was the one who found her and invited her to the school.the tarot was underused and it definitely is but what annoyed me was that the character never interprets the cards. she’d pull a card like ‘two or cups’ but that’s all, it doesn’t help the story for people who don’t do tarot. also even tho i do tarot and i know what it means every reader has a different interpretation. a weird thing i noticed is that Vad’s name was barely used like there’d be scenes between them and it’d just describe him and then would be like “he” instead of Vad and i’d be like who???i reread this book for a video and the first time i read it i didn’t notice how much this author beats things over your head like the amount of times the words: little crow, devil, witch and madness was sooo fucking annoying. another thing is that this book isn’t fantasy, it tries to make it seem like witchcraft is real but honestly doesn’t flesh it out enough. this book tries so hard to be dark but it just isn’t, vad and corvina are the equivalent to those weird couples that date in high school. the grammatical errors and such were definitely fixed in this book so i do appreciate that but there was some things about the book that could’ve been fixed like the repetition. there are parts of this book that just feels lazy, there are plots that are dropped or there’s absolutely no explanation for them. they’re acknowledged but still no explanation and the author just goes “some things don’t have answers” girl that’s just laziness you are not a good enough writer to pull that off.

4770048920	DNF @53% Sighhhh... I don't really get the rave reviews on this one lol at all. I mean, this isn't the first time I'm somewhat in the minority, it surely won't be the last. But lemme just say that this book is listed and apparently marketed as New Adult, College, and Adult when it actually reads like a 'gothic' Young Adult version of shadows creeping around the hallways of a castle version of West Beverly High with the amount of times I had to read 'Like Totally' 'OMG Seriously' 'OMG Totally for real man' 🙄 - Don’t get me wrong, I have read some super YA novels that overuse these terms and still loved them but they are that, YA. At 53% nothing has happened but this emo FMC walking around a cemetery and hearing voices in her head, seeing some so called spooky things and her having insta lust for her professor. I can only imagine the reason this book is listed as NA is due to the multiple pointless sexual encounters this chick is having with her teacher. I don't have any problem with smut but someone please dish me out a plot. Aside from some shadows, teenage lingo, hot for teacher sex - we are constantly reminded of ole dudes 𝙎𝙞𝙡𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙀𝙮𝙚𝙨.'𝘏𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴 𝘨𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘰𝘸''𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦, 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳-𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘥 𝘥𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘭 𝘯𝘰𝘥𝘥𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘦 𝘬𝘦𝘦𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘴''𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘢, 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴''𝘊𝘰𝘳𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘢 𝘧𝘦𝘭𝘵 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘮 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘳𝘰𝘰𝘵 𝘪𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘮𝘢𝘤𝘩, 𝘧𝘭𝘶𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘢𝘴 𝘴𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳-𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘥 𝘥𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘭 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘦𝘯𝘥 𝘩𝘦𝘳''𝘈 𝘧𝘪𝘳𝘮 𝘨𝘳𝘪𝘱 𝘰𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘦, 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴 𝘭𝘰𝘤𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘴''𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴, 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘢𝘥𝘦 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩 𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩''𝘏𝘦 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘦𝘥 𝘶𝘱 𝘢𝘴 𝘢 𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘩 𝘤𝘳𝘶𝘯𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘵, 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘦𝘳, 𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘰𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘵''𝘏𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘴𝘵𝘶𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘴 𝘴𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘸 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘰𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳.

6637432963	Ya'll out here giving this book 5 stars? HOWWWWWWWWWW?!?Reading this was worse than my experience reading Fourth Wing. How do you start a plot and then completely ignore it and drop it!? Shit apparently anything that goes viral on TikTok is deemed worthy of being a good book! LIESSSSSSSS!How does one write such cringe sex scenes? How does one create such flat and one dimensional characters? Listen, I gave it a chance. I read it and I'm glad it's over. If you love this book then more power you too, but hell to the nah nah nah. Ain't no way ya'll will catch me saying this shit was even remotely entertaining or romantic.
6347593032	This read had such beautiful writing, a haunting setting, and sexual tension that burns on each page. I devoured this one.
6595902964	here we goo
4063699026	”I’m scared one day Verenmore will have more ghosts than people. I just hope we don’t end up as one of them.” I didn’t really care much about the romance, I was more interested in the eerie atmosphere and the creepy gothic elements in it. I definitely preferred the author’s dark verse series more, but this was still good enough. The plot and the setting were fine, I just wasn’t a fan of the characters or the romance. ”You’re the mountain I build my castle on, brick by brick,” I wish the romance wasn’t so insta. I would’ve loved to see their development, but they just happened so fast. I’d take Tristan’s silent treatment than this. I think they slept together once, he ignored her for weeks, and then he was going all alpha and claiming her. I was like dude chill you’re moving so fast. It was kinda too much and not really convincing. Or maybe it’s the fact that I’m a sucker for a good slow burn which would’ve really worked with this book.
6497332391	2.5⭐️This started out okay, but around the halfway point I just started to lose interest. However I did have pretty low expectations going into this so I wasn’t too surprised by just overall feeling underwhelmedThe romance: it felt very insta lovie to me so it really lacked that tension and angst you typically get from a professor/student relationship. I just didn’t really feel the chemistry between the couple so I was a bit disconnected from them. The spice was SCRUMPTIOUS at first but towards the end I just started to skip over it because I felt like that’s what they’re relationship revolves around. I loved our MMC in the beginning but he ended up just lacking any sort of depth for me, I think I just wanted so much more from him. I liked the FMC but felt like she also just bored me a bit.The plot: I did really enjoy the murder mystery aspect of this but I honestly can’t pinpoint exactly what it was, but something was just MISSING! I wasn’t at all invested in what happened and I think that’s because the romance took the front seat. What to expect- dark gothic romance- Professor/student- Murder mystery- Dark academia - Spooky vibes - Morally grey MMC Overall, it was fine but I don’t think I would recommend it at the end of the day.
7477850081	Reading Gothikana was like listening to Lana Del Rey in a thunderstorm while wearing lace gloves! :D02:05 ━━━━●───── 04:10 ㅤ ㅤ ⇄ ◀ 𓊕 ▶ ↻Now playing- Dark Paradise- Lana Del Rey The heart of the story is the eerie yet enchanting Varnhagen Castle, now a university for the strange and brilliant. It’s a place where the walls whisper, the fog listens and every corridor feels like it’s watching you🙂.I actually had to hold my breath throughout the book. A perfect mixture of gothic × rom 💕A gothic-fantasy cocktail spiked with mystery, desire and a suspiciously charismatic professor...Yes, you heard that correct- a professor 😔I did get disgusted initially, but after knowing about their age-gap, it did calm my nerves down🏰 The Setting: 🏰Darlington University is no Hogwarts—it’s gloomier, foggier and probably has more tragic backstories per student capita. If cobwebs could talk, they’d say, “Run.” Okay, let's appreciate the name given to our fmc first... It's Corvina! It is so beautiful!!! Glad that- references to my fav POE has been taken<3🎓Corvina: A reclusive, raven-haired scholar with a tragic past and a thirst for knowledge, plucked straight from the velvet pages of a Victorian diary. She reads like your quiet classmate who might summon ravens after lunch.🎓Vad Deverell: Professor of Gothic studies. Mysterious, emotionally constipated and frankly too attractive to be grading papers with a voice like velvet and a past darker than the castle’s dungeons.It's part haunted academia, partly forbidden romance and partly “who’s hiding the cursed artifact.” You'll question everyone’s sanity—including your own for staying up till 3AM with this book XD
4017092577	This was such a spooky and atmospheric romance unlike anything I've read before! I loved that this took place at a spooky college that had all of the creepy elements. We had creepy woods, a creepy lake, a creepy cemetery, and a creepy old school with secret tunnels and strange murders. Vad is a professor with a bad boy reputation and Corvina is immediately intrigued by him. They enter a relationship, but Corvina doesn't know how much she can trust Vad or what rumors about him are true. While it was a professor/student romance, nothing felt too taboo because Corvina was only about five years younger that Vad. It was definitely creepy following the two of them as they were trying to uncover more about the mysterious deaths that have happened at the college and in the town. I also liked how suspenseful things became at the end and the secrets that came out. If you're in the mood for an atmospheric dark academia romance, you should definitely check this out. We were left with a lot of unanswered questions, so I'm hoping the author writes a second book after this!
4746479701	3.5★See, the thing with this book is that I set my expectations way too high. Don´t get me wrong I liked it, but there were just way too many things left unanswered. It's actually frustrating the hell out of me tbh cus now I have to fill the voids of unanswered things myself. Like common you write a whole 450 pages book and you couldn't make it a bit longer to give us readers some answers? In case someone finds the answers, it would be highly appreciated if you let me know. Thanks!Anyway I was going to lie in this review and blah blah about only good things, but i think it's only fair if i also talk about the things i didn't like.Lets get on to the characters, shall we?𝘾𝙤𝙧𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙖 𝘾𝙡𝙚𝙢𝙢 𝙖𝙡𝙨𝙤 𝙠𝙣𝙤𝙬𝙣 𝙖𝙨 𝙇𝙞𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚 𝙘𝙧𝙤𝙬 𝙤𝙧 𝙇𝙞𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙘𝙝. A sweet purple eyed girl who has never had real relationships with people besides her mom. Well she and her mom didn't really have a relationship since her mother is demented and mentally not available to talk to. Corvina is such a badass ahsqshazbd i actually really liked her clothing style, the chokers, the nose piercing and skirts ughh love it.𝗩𝗮𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗹. Our silver eyed professor, he was sexy in the relationship but umm how can you always only fall for your students? No judging, just curious.🫣 It´s okay for one time but every fucking time is....I kinda found him too lust driven in the second half but I actually also loved how he cared about her there. Ehh struggle cuz I have 2 kinds of thoughts about him. One where I liked him and one where I disliked him. It really dependent on how he acted. Anyway I liked his nickname for Corvina. Overall I liked the story but it's not the best thing I've ever read. I did enjoy the ending even though it´s left unanswered, it made me so excited and curious while reading it.

4060216393	⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 🌶🌶🌶🌶/5 TW: Explicit Sexual Content, Crude Language, Dark Themes, Psychological Trauma and Suicide. I am pleasantly surprised by this read. I picked up this book after seeing it constantly on bookstagram for over a week. I came into this book without any expectations and I am glad that I didn't know exactly what to expect. Was this perfect? No. I have a few little nit-picky things to point out, however the only reason I will point them out it is because they are nothing more than constructive criticism . There is SO MUCH potential behind this author's writing style and imagination. I know people's writing develop the more they write and I want to make sure RuNyx knows she has the skill and that little seed inside of her that could turn her into one of my favorite authors. This is the sort of book I search for. These are the sort of vibes I could read forever and ever, this is my tribe. Romantic ghost stories, tragic, consuming, maddening dark romances are the reason I read every single day. I live for this style of writing, gothic romance is EVERYTHING to me and Gothikana (as it is in the name, delivered almost every possible aspect of a goth romance I could wish for). Here are the small things I think could be improved: 1. the repetition of certain sayings, and again these are very small notes, but she used the sentence "phantom ants" a lot. I think the real challenge in a book is to make sure you wear, tear and expand all the vocabulary you could possibly have to describe things differently every time. 2.This book could have been a little longer, I feel like Vad and Corvina had a very rushed, out of nowhere start and gothic romances thrive when you add a good slow burn and a more of an intricate development, they needed more time at the beginning to really connect so things wouldn't feel forced. 3.Some small dialogues were slightly cringy, and I mean this in a kind way, I think this also goes back to repetition, some things didn't need to be said more than once, they have more impact that way. I am only saying this because I really loved this book and I had SUCH A GREAT TIME reading it. I feel like RuNyx has something really special and she is so close to PERFECTION. I would only make this amount of nit-picky annoying notes for a book I care about and for an author I really want to succeed. Now to the GOOD, awesome things about it. The sex scenes were freaking phenomenal, the best I have read in a while. The tension was incredible, the age-gap romance was absolutely exquisite, the teacher-student trope was out of this world and executed perfectly, the mystery was creative. The story, the vibes, the castle, everything had a huge personality and soul. Our main character was sweet, intriguing, her mind was easy to follow and the world RuNyx created was easy to get lost in. The plot twists were fire, the gothic scenery and hidden secrets were exactly the mood I'd love to have in every book I read. I can't wait to see what Runyx comes up with next, I really want to see her succeed and feed my gothic/dark romance addiction the same way Keri Lake does. I bet this book was really hard to write and she did it wonderfully!
4489564053	4.5 stars ✰ “the dead woman is […].” first of all, WTF WAS THAT ENDING?? i had so much adrenaline. the last 100 pages of the book was so fucking good omg. the suspense was killing me. i highlighted so much stuff, during the last parts of the book, and wrote “what the fuck” for. each. one. because my eyes were wide and my mouth was agape from all the shock. the whole reveal to the reason for everything happening was so unexpected and i kept guessing but i was completely wrong. my mind couldn’t keep up with everything. i’m still processing things as i write this review.this book is SO much more than a teacher fucking his student. i was more captivated and interested in the whole plot(s). i was so eager to unravel the mysteries, uncover the truth about the deaths and know more about verenmore.verenmore is a very spooky, haunted and mysterious school that has a past no one knows about, except for one person. you get to find out about the weird killings every five years during the black ball, about the two bizarre suicides, which btw, why in the hell did they have to kill off such a good character? 😭 imo i think the romance isn’t the main factor of this book. yes, there’s loads of tension between the two main characters, yes, there’s loads of sex but the atmosphere of this book is incredible. my review won’t do this book enough justice. the gothic vibe, the witchy involvement, the supernatural, the character development and the plots were so well written. this book is truly a masterpiece. i haven’t read a book like this before and i hope i’ll find some more 🤞🏼i still have so many questions that are not answered. but mainly what happened with roy? i wanted to know who was behind that. she’d always wanted to belong, to be loved, to be cherished by someone despite every baggage she came with. — corvina was such an interesting character. slowly uncovering things about her madness and revealing stuff about her and her mom was so intriguing. i never got bored reading about her. the adventures in the woods she went on, her nightmares and discovering new things, being told/warned, in her head, about what was going to happen and it being right. also, piecing the truth together after having built up so much suspense was so thrilling. she was also so relatable.i loved the whole purple eyes, tarot cards, crystals, dark aesthetic. she was a breath of fresh air and i love that. her personality was really refreshing to read about. i love that she basically wrote the book too! he leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to her nose, right above her piercing. “i never regretted kissing you, little crow.” — vad was one of those, cocky, arrogant and possessive mmc. was he hot? yes. is he like every other mmc? also yes. i will never not swoon over him calling her little crow. he was so dominant but he was so sweet sometimes. the kisses on her nose and forehead really did something to me. he was there for her and saw her for her. he didn’t think she was crazy, he helped her and calmed her. he was very lust driven in the second half of the book, which i don’t personally like. i don’t like it when there’s too much sex but the sex scenes weren’t all that anyway. “if this is madness,” she whispered almost against his lips, “drown me in it.” corvina and vad together were so powerful, my god. the tension was there! the mouth on that man was something else. the dirty talk? mhm. corvina and vad were so different but in the best way possible. their chemistry has altered my brain forever. their story was so fascinating to read about i was begging for more. i didn’t like that it was kinda insta-love. i kinda wanted more build up and more sexual tension before anything happened.i didn’t like that i had so many questions and no answers. the ending wasn’t rushed but there could’ve been more. overall, i need to go to verenmore bc i’m in love with that place. silences were comfortable but most people didn’t feel that way.i feel that waybut she knew the books she read were fictional, and chances of her, of all people, finding anything remotely similar were slim.HAHAHAHAHA fuck you.
7216825390	CORVINAAA my fav lil witch, she kinda gave me Jennifer’s Body vibes. not in the menace way, but in that effortlessly hot, mysterious, and magnetic kinda way. like… people just orbit her.this book had all the witchy chaos i wanted, but it also surprised me with how spooky and dark it got at times. i’d read a few reviews before starting and wasn’t sure what to expect, but it ended up being such a fun, fast-paced read.drama?✅spice?✅✅✅a little morally grey energy?✅✅✅✅that said, it’s definitely not everyone’s cup of tea and that’s okay. it’s bold, a lil weird, and doesn’t hold your hand. i took off a star because a few parts some parts had me staring at the page like “be so serious right now,” and there’s one scene that almost made me close the book and go outside to touch grass (you’ll know exactly when). also…keep Vad away from nipples at all costs. i’m still recovering.

6725003491	➳ 3.5 ★ “devil. devil of verenmore.” i was so scared to start this, because i heard it was very similar to nocticadia by keri lake. i did enjoy that book, however every issue that i found with that, i also found here. i am not saying either author copied anything, but the premise and overall plot was very similar to each other. because i read that first, i may make a few references to that book, with no spoilers of course. this is a dark academia? romance about our two main characters; vad (professor adjacent?) and corvina (a student at verenmore university). their age gap was not a major issue for me, as she is 22 and he is only 28. the vibes and overall setting of this world was really interesting/alluring, however, there was too much prose and monologue, which started to drag a lot for me. i personally felt like they had good chemistry, but unfortunately it was wasted in this story. they had more build up and scenes with each other, as opposed to bramwell and lilia from nocticadia. however, both books have the same pacing issue when it comes to their relationship/romance.☾⋆ corvina ~ take a fucking shot every time this girl said deverell's silver eyes—clashed with her purple ones. i thought i was reading about nesta and rhysand for a hot minute. i feel like she was a good enough main character to keep the story moving. 90% of the POV in this book is hers, and ruynx said she did this so we would feel confused about vad. i don't have an issue with that per se, it's mostly just jarring because 70% of her monologue was her describing the same shit. the setting, his face, his body, the creepy vibes, the spooky town? i got it the first time, thank you. other than that, she wasn't overly naive and annoying, and matched vad's energy pretty well. she was a great friend and an overall compelling FMC. i liked her a lot. ⤷ “you tell me not to expect anything, that you don’t get attached. you fuck me and ignore me for weeks, and then you corner me and demand to know if i’ve been with anyone else like you have some kind of right?” she hissed. “what the fuck is wrong with you?”➼ this made me laugh to be honest. i like that she wasn't out here needy for him and he was lowkey the pathetic love sick man after her. she definitely had a backbone and i think her biggest flaw was wasted potential. this story could've been longer. ☾⋆ deverell ~ he is the typical asshole scary professor who everyone is afraid of, except corvina. unlike a lot of other student/teacher romance novels, vad was quite protective of her from the start, and always defended her. typically in these types of taboo novels, the professor—usually the man—doesn't show any feeling or emotion until the 50/60% mark. however, in this case, he was a no nonsense man from the start when it came to her. and i cannot deny that i actually liked that. again, i did feel like he was a wasted potential because the story ended way sooner than i anticipated. ⤷ “he wants you.” “he can’t have you.”➼ very similar to my issues with nocticadia, their romance came way too quickly. there should've been a more gradual build up to this line, with tension and longing. there was a lot of 0-100 that happened which left me a little bamboozled. ➛ their relationship was the driving factor in this novel; as it is a heavy dark gothic romance? novel. the premise and the characters are good, but with a little less repetition and some more plot + development, this could've easily been a higher rating for me. this is my first novel by ruynx, and i think she is very talented so i am excited to move from here. i think she could easily make a sequel in this world, even with the same characters. i don't think she would, but i am open to the idea.
6693068317	This was my first time reading RuNyx's book. Saw the pretty cover and I jumped in blind, not even knowing what it was about. Couple chapters in I realized this was a Teacher x Student forbidden romance. Their relationship was pure insta-love lust, their secret rendezvous gave me anxiety! It felt like they were trying to get caught ON PURPOSE! The smut was definitely spicy. I wanted to love this so SO bad.. But had to knock off 1 star because honestly some part of the book felt like an architecture tour with its excessive descriptions of gothic structures, school-castle-forest directions, and all the aesthetic vibes. I GET IT! But I’d rather have some answers to the many MANY mysteries in the story that was unfortunately left unanswered. It didn't go down 3 stars because I actually love the plot twist, DEFINITELY DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. I especially like Corvina's character development, I was rooting for her the entire time. Her struggle with her sanity, battling the voices in her head, and those witchy vibes? Loved it. And Vad.. Oh how I wish we had more of his POV! The story started with his prophecy, but most of it unfolded through Corvina’s eyes. Overall, I enjoyed the book.. Could it have been better? For sure! But it is what it is.
5045397886	3 ⭐️ A fine story. Certainly had its moment."I'm scared one day Verenmore will have more ghosts than people. I just hope we don't end up as one of them."WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ Gothic romance✨ Dark academia ✨ Boarding school✨ Haunted castle and woods✨ Forbidden romance✨ Teacher x student✨ Virgin FMC✨ Morally gray MMC✨ Praise kink✨ Voyeurism / Exhibitionism ✨ Murder-mystery✨ Paranormal / Psychological thriller aspects What I liked: The dark academia atmosphere and gothic vibes were amazing! From the creepy castle to the dark, eerie woods, the setting was perfect for this horror/mystery/romance. There were also a few times that I was genuinely creeped out. RuNyx did a fabulous job with the descriptions, so I really was able to have a clear picture of Verenmore in my head while reading. The mystery plot was addicting. I started reading for the romance, but I stayed for the mystery! The history of Verenmore, coupled with Vad's backstory, was so juicy! I was constantly chomping at the bits for more information, which the author annoyingly liked to hand out in bits and pieces. RuNyx really knows how to keep the audience interested! I was so addicted I stayed up till 2am reading. And that plot twist at the end! It completely took me by surprise. I LOVED the uncertainty that the voices in Corvina's head were real or part of a mental health condition. We still don't really know in the end, but since Corvina truly gives off witchy vibes, I like to believe she's connected to the paranormal. I also lean more toward this because of the old woman's prediction about Vad meeting the girl with purple eyes. I love Vad's absolute commitment to Corvina. This man would do absolutely everything for her, and that's the kind of love I like to see. It was especially meaningful by the end to see that no matter what happens with Corvina, he will always be there to take care of her and give her the love and support she needs. ❤️"I will have you even in death, little witch. I am your beast. I am your madness. And you, you're my afterlife." What I didn't liked: I had a few issues with the romance.1. It was rushed. It's basically insta-lust. No getting to know each other before f*cking. 2. I never felt connected to them. This was due to the lack of development in the initial stages of their relationship since it was all lust. 3. I wasn't a fan of the spicy scenes because of the descriptive words and dirty talk. For example:- "Magic eyes, magic pussy."- Her walls clenching and unclenching around him, so rapidly he punched his cock through them one last time. - "I," slam "am" slam "your" slam "madness."- "And if I am? Does that make you loathe me? Will that keep your pussy dry?"- He drove into her harshly . . . her pants muffled by his flesh and their hips slapped together, mating in the most primitive, basic way a man and a woman could mate.- He drilled into her from behind. The pacing often felt slow. A lot of the interactions between Corvina and Vad are so similar that they started to blend together to the point where I felt like nothing was happening. And some 'truths' were uncovered at the end, so there's just a lot of waiting and suspense. The story leaves us with many unanswered questions. Like, we’re just supposed to be fine without knowing the truth behind the Black Ball disappearances or what had happened to Roy that one night? This was obviously intentional by the author, but I was bothered that so many of the questions we had since the beginning are not answered. Overall, this was a story that kept my interest and would be perfect to read during spooky season. It's not a favorite of mine, but I'm glad I read it just to see what all the fuss was about.
6232255223	i’m sorry 😭
3929713541	Gothikana has so many different vibes and such great ones on top of it. Bram Stocker’s Dracula is my favorite book, and this book gave me such aesthetics of the book. ( There is no vampire in this one, just the vibes of Dracula). After receiving Corvina receives a letter from admissions of The University of Verenmore, she believes she can have a new take on life. Twenty-one years of age, she was homeschooled and sheltered. She didn't expect Vad, her Professor, deaths, and the mystery of the castle. There is an instant attraction between the two, and boy, can you feel it. Vad is very mysterious, dark, broody, and hot as sin. A force to be reckoned with. Corvina and Vad are everything. They were born for each other. “My little witch with those fucking purple eyes, fucking made for me. And I’m your devil, am I not?” Corvina rocked her hips back against him, whimpering. “My devil.” I absolutely love the world RuNyx created with this book and how we are transported to such a beautiful and gothic world. I have to be honest, I was very intrigued going in, it’s not my first gothic book, and the author literally blew my mind. I am obsessed with this book. The author went into great detail about the setting, and the plot is impressive. I hope to see more of Vad and Corvina in the future.
3856352897	4.5 ⭐I SCREAMED!!! okay hands down idk if I love Vad more then Run other heros... I KNOW HOW DARE I!!! But lordddd that man can Run me over with his tongue any day. I said what I said!!!

5024722532	ESTA ES LA VERSIÓN SPICY DE MERLINA Y ME ENCANTA.mi único problema es que no estaba en el mood para leer un misterio. la verdad es que partí este libro esperando encontrar sexo y nada más. PERO TIENE TRAMA. y eso me sorprendió JAJAJAJA es muy interesante el desarrollo de la historia, pero quedaron algunos cabos sueltos que le molestan a mi mente. aún así, se pasó bien
4134462661	DNF’ed at 27%. Everything about this book was cliche and cringe, from the ‘not like other girls’ MC to the broody love interest with the most creepy lines. This is just so badly written. This book is not it.
6627937617	im going into this blindly. not reading the synopsis and even the reviews.i though this was like some type of beauty and the beast, the fmc enter into mmc castle and he prisoned her based on the cover. ITS NOT! i'm totally wrong. this is teacher/ student trope. im starting get the ick when know that but this is more better than what i expected. the fmc (Corvina) and mmc (Vad) chemistry was mind blowing 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 the thrilling and mystery in this story ughhhhh. It make me addicted and not want to stop reading. page by page, i want to know who are behind the student suicide/missing (trigger warning). but i'm sure from the beginning, Vad didn't doing it. Vad is mysterious kind of guy and make ppl assume that it him behind the dead/ missing of students/ppl there. if he do it, I did not think he will get caught because he smart and rich enough to never get caught > btw he said that not me. i love the vibe possessiveness mmc, he even get jealous when Corvina said another man's name and saw her sitting side with another man. ehem stalker alert, he also not first meet with Corvina at Verenmore, but u will shocked when u know where he first meet her.my fav scene >>>> the support from him"Build your castle, Corvina,” he told her quietly as they both watched the view outside. “I’m not moving anywhere. Build your castle as fucking high as you want.”THE PLOT TWIST IM SHOCKED!! i feel pity to one of Corvina friends but not anymore bcs iykyk. Corvina was excited having a friend but turn out being betrayed. she should take serious in Troy warning in the beginning.
6372280013	I really REALLY enjoyed this!!!! I think it’s one of the better dark romances that I’ve read! Loved the characters although the end was a tad predictable I would still read it again♥️🦇
5882944817	i still have so many questions… miss runyx where my answers at
4066409156	“This will last until the day roses on my grave stop sharing roots with the roses on yours,” he declared. “I will have you even in death, little witch. I am your beast. I am your madness. And you, you’re my afterlife.” I would’ve written this sooner, but my eyes are dry from bingeing the fourth season of Elite.I don’t know what it is about older men; the seductive masculine vibes they give just does it for me. If I imagined half of the things Vad says in this book, come out of some “bad-boy” in a bully romance, I would’ve DNF’ed it. @TJ; I take back everything I said about us having different taste in books and @Matilda: your review gave my the final push to start this. My views on this book isn’t different from everyone else. I think this was dark in a way that was hauntingly beautiful. The writing and the description in this gave me the “dark academia vibes” i wanted going into this book. There were so many aspects that I loved about this book and so many that were just predictable CORVINA So I get the whole “she’s not like every other girl” theme that’s going on with her, but I genuinely liked her character and personality. She was shy without being meek and her friendship with the gang was one she didn’t ignore or make it a lesser priority like the other heroines in student-teacher romances. “The only rule she broke was hooking up with a professor.”“That’s not allowed?” Corvina asked, curious.Jade shook her head. “Absolutely not. It’s one of the strictest rules here. Students and faculty have different lives”And she didn’t just have a magic pussy; she had magic with tarot cards too. That was a fun lil addition to the story, I don’t think ive ever read anything with them. And cutesy/ fangirl moment :(view spoiler)[ Vad asks her for a Tarot reading to check “if the woman he’s in love with feels the same” *Me dying of loneliness* (hide spoiler)] VAD FUCKING DEVERELL This man. He is the definition of a broody-mysterious-stranger. Because that’s exactly what he was throughout the entire book. A stranger. Inspite of this whole ”I have a lot of secrets and I cant get attached with you” bs, he intrigued me to infinite depths. I like that he didn’t push the h away to build walls, he was honest with her and himself about his feelings for her. Was I annoyed about his secrets? Not really. You don’t even notice it with how quickly the story progresses. Besides, corvina had her secrets too; I practically died when she called out ”Mo?” when they were having sex.“You might be a luring siren but I’m no ordinary sailor. I’m a mad pirate and I’m trying to resist your call. If I land on your shores, I will plunder and take away everything worth having. Be very careful giving me those eyes.”And I actually enjoyed the classes he taught. It was a dark and an interesting subject in general : Danse Macabre He’s also very sexy“I would’ve kissed you bathed in blood, Corvina. If I had a chance to kiss you while a thousand ghosts rose from their graves, I would have kissed you. Don’t doubt that.” RELATIONSHIP I admit in the beginning I was kind of annoyed that they didn’t have any interactions before getting into their relationship. I mean they had eye contact… yeah nope. There was no sexual tension or even angst that I wanted pre-fuckathon.it didn’t bother me later on because their chemistry was through the fucking roof. Very mature (more or less) and honest ( omission of truth not included) “I want to know your side of the story.”“Can you just... not look at me while I’m speaking? It makes the nerves worse.”“Vad nodded, putting his hands on her thighs and spreading them wider, his fingers playing on her knees. “I’ll be looking at something else. And if you’re good, I’ll make you come.” POSSESSIVE SMUT I think I finally understand why the sex scenes got a whole different category; this author writes smut like no-other. I love possessive heroes. Always have. It might irk some people but I eat that shit up. Its amazingly arousing and Vad Deverell’s mouth spits out that shit like a meoldy“Would a stranger know the exact taste of your come on his tongue?”“Would a stranger know exactly how deep his cock can go in that tight pussy, hmm?”“Would a stranger know the way those your tits bounce when your nipple is flicked?”“You want to know who I am?” he punched his hips harshly against her.”“I,” slam “am” slam “your” slam “madness.”“I’m in your head, in your blood, in your very veins. I’ve claimed you before anything else ever could. Your body, your heart, your mind, your fucking soul, it’s all mine. Your hunger is mine to feed, your madness is mine to tame. Do you feel that?”“Don’t think about me with that boy at your side,” he told her, his eyes fierce. “The call of these,” he twisted one nipple between his fingers, “is just for me. I’d hate to hurt him.”🙈I swooned. MYSTERY The main storyline revolved around the mysterious deaths taking place at the university and we follow Corvina (who has visions and a voice in her head) try to find out why and how this is happening.Was I surpised? Yes. I was so focused on the smut and relationship that I lost track of the mystery aspect of the plot.Was it satisfying? Ehhh, sure? But I guess that’s more me than the book OVERALL I throughly enjoyed this book for what it was. Could it have been better? YesMaybe a little more about the voices in her head and about (view spoiler)[how Roy ended up in the lake. (hide spoiler)] I would completely recommend this to someone looking for something hot and easy to get into. “If something like that happens, you tell me. If you need help, you tell me. If you need comfort, you tell me. Whatever it takes. I get to be the only madness inside you, you understand?”
4785379424	DNF @ 60% I checked out when Vad said “magic pussy” 💀😭 I cringed so hard! The tension was so great in the beginning but they acted on it too quickly so the build up fizzled out completely. I love reading about a morally grey, enigmatic character but I did not like Vad at all. I didn’t feel the connection between Corvina and Vad and the back and forth was annoying. And the sex? Soooo boring and Vad's dirty talk was just not it. I’m really disappointed because I loved The Predator and The Reaper by RuNyx. I also lost interest in the whole plot for some reason. It all just kind of seemed dumb, like if I went to that school I’m sorry but I would HAUL ASS out of there. I don’t even know why those students even went there in the first place. So feeling no connection between the main characters, not liking the MMC, PLUS being bored with the plot officially made me DNF this 💔
6014446151	2.5⭐️ To miało cudowny klimat, tajemnicze zaginięcia i głosy w głowie Corviny też były interesujące, ale ten festiwal żenady: cycuszków, majteczek, soczków i twardniejących co chwilę sutków wszystko zepsuł 🫥+ „płaczące ścianki cipki” oraz „„jej cipka wytrysnęła, a dusza zaczęła krwawić” 🙃🙃🙃 przynajmniej jest wspominany kobiecy wytrysk, a to się rzadko zdarza, więc wow!
6448129810	Okay, I get the negative reviews, but sorry you're so wrong. I WILL fight!I don't mind the unanswered questions, and I actually had many more than the ones mentioned. It's okay! RuNyx in the acknowledgment said how writing this brought her closure for her own experience, and I mean isn't this what art is for?RuNyx also described this book as para-psychological, and I completely get it. This was beautiful and speaks to the deepest parts of our psyche that are still not discovered or understood, and work in mysterious ways. And I am not just saying that because I am a psychologist and schizophrenic patients are like Top 1 on my favourite list.This was beautiful, exciting, lustful, gothic, and mystic through and through.RuNyx never disappoints with the plot and the twists, and she keeps me wondering, waiting for the next page in her books to really know what was happening.Would I read this again in a year? Absolutely.Would I make my partner use some of Vad's dialogue in our vows and in our daily life? Abso-fucking-lutely.Call me a hopeless romantic, go ahead. Because I am, and I surely love how un-cringy cringe RuNyx writes her characters.
6307354836	3/5THE PLOT TWIST. I definitely didn't saw that coming AT ALL.
5588455752	"She accepted his dark parts and filled them with her stars." Honestly theres nothing much to write about, this book was just one long paragraph of confusion.HALF of the book was unanswered, which i don't usually mind, it spices up my day... HOWEVER.I feel like one of the main plots was trying to find out why people went missing at every black ball, yet the secrets were never revealed! yay! ✧༺♡༻✧ Corvina i loved her, she was super sweet but my gosh she was clueless, half of things that was a "plot twist" at the end could of easily been discovered near the beginning of the book if she used that academic brain. By the end of the book i was screaming at her because she just didn't put 1 + 1 together.(also i wish there was some deeper meaning as to why her eyes were violet instead of "they just were") Vad HONESTLY I COULD NOT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY AT THE END. "The colour reminded me of your eyes right after you come." What does that even mean? Am i missing something because last i checked your eyes don't change colour after sex. "And you, you're my afterlife." I actually loved his character at the start, he had this mysterious, broody, Lance Orion vibe going on, however if you asked me to tell you ONE fact i knew about him by the end of the book, i couldn't tell you. I like reading about mysterious guys but GIMME SOMETHING. ANYTHING.And finally, there was chemistry but it felt more lust than love. I think they believed they had to be together since it was prophesied (fated mates, woo!) but their relationship just seemed more forced? ✧༺♡༻✧Quick shoutout to Mo. He single handedly carried this book!
4507605555	3.5/5I could probably give it more stars, if not, there are some unanswered questions in this book. "This will last until the day roses on my grave stop sharing roots with the roses on yours,” he declared. “I will have you even in death, little witch. I am your beast. I am your madness. And you, you’re my afterlife.”"You’re my mountain, my Vad. I don’t know how and I don’t understand why, but somehow, I’m building my castle on you."
4192179700	We all know Gothikana has been making the popularity rounds on Bookstagram and it’s definitely been on my TBR for a while. So after some (very brief) convincing I decided to pick it up.We follow Corvina who has been given admission to a exclusive university in a creepy castle (we love a creepy castle). Add in some murder mystery, a bit of witchcraft, an enigmatic teacher and a bit of found family and here we are.Dark academia is a world I don’t tend to specifically go looking for but hot damn I am always happy when I do.What did I think? I bloody loved it. I was nervous Corvina was going to give us damsel in distress vibes but she most certainly did not. Owning her mental health the whole way through (which is extremely important to me).I would definitely sign the petition for more Vivi and Vad (and Mo).Would I recommend? Wholeheartedly
4301592769	Rating: 3.5Thanks to the lovely Mia for recommending this!! I am also in love with Vad!! It’s hard to find a dark, adult and romance book that actually develops a story rather than focusing solely on the smut. Gothikana really hit the spot for me :D. If anyone has recommendations please let me know! Pick this up if you enjoy or don't mind: ❤️ Insta Love between a good girl and dark broody guy. The relationship went from 0 to 100 in no time🚫 Forbidden Student and teacher romance (though it didn’t feel that forbidden, there was nothing to lose) 🔥 Hot chemistry, smut and spice! 🖤 Dark academia setting 🕵️‍♂️ Mystery What I enjoyed:This was a fun, quick and easy read. I loved the dark academia and mysterious setting and the smutty romance! I am a fan of Vad! He was dark, enigmatic and intense! Damn, why did my uni not have a Vad or Carlsen haha. What I wanted more of:There was a lot of mystery but they weren’t well explained or built up enough, there was nothing more than basic descriptions and pass by mentions in a conversation. Some specific examples:- I simply had to accept that the forest was dark and dangerous. People roamed in and out unscathed which actually made it seem fine. - History and story of the slayers was brief. - What's with the horny ball and why did no one question it? - The premonition that Vad would meet a purple eyed person. What was the significance? I wished there was some greater meaning.- Why do people go missing only on full moons? I'm ok when there are unexplained phenomena or events, but the ball and the disappearances felt like a big hole. If this is going to be a series then that's fine, but not as a standalone. Lack of character development. Corvina was meant to be a shy, introverted and sheltered person who hasn’t had much interaction with people. However there wasn't enough indication that her experiences were new and she never really had any hesitation, especially the romance scenes! I was really hoping to see her grow but she was more or less the same the whole way through. Also every other character was secondary. I wish the romance between Vad and Corvina took more time to develop because just one look and the deal was sealed.
5250184061	This was my first dark academia book and i enjoyed every second of it!! The vibes were js amazing and i wish i read it in autumn then it would've been even better:)This book revolved around so many things and not js vad and corvina. The last 100 pages were AMAZING. it was gothic, thrilling, and romantic all wrapped up into one. I loved this smm!! vad and corvina r so hot and i loved them together!!!
4738612164	head empty just “If this is madness,” she whispered almost against his lips, “drown me in it.” (shakespeare is rolling around in his grave right now)also vad could bodyslam me into ongoing traffic and i'd thank him
4205344408	"I am your beast. I am your madness. And you, you're my afterlife." Gothikana is a gothic paranormal romance set at a mythical university. Corvina Clemm has been isolated her entire life from the big evil world. When she receives a mysterious invite to attend the University of Verenmore, she ventures off to begin a new adventure. At the university, she meets many interesting people, and one man, in particular, draws her in. Vad Deverell is her professor and has quite a reputation on campus. With an instant connection and a mysterious draw, Vad and Corvina are pulled together, and nothing can keep them apart! "Haunting in the way only very few living things could be, because it sent a shiver down the spine and cloaked itself in the darkness and fed on the energy around them." Overall, Gothikana will appeal to fans of gothic paranormal romance who enjoy a passionate and intense read. No matter how hard I try, I cannot embrace the student-teacher trope, but the intense connection between Vad and Corvina and the exquisite writing made this book engaging throughout the story. This was my first RuNyx read, and I look forward to checking out more from this author. This was our September Shhlutty Read!https://bit.ly/Sep2021SRFor more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit:
4420693755	Alrighty. So. *grimaces*I'm the biggest sucker for dark academia and the gloomy, atmospheric vibes that go along with it. As my first Kindle Unlimited read, I thought there was no way I could go wrong with Gothikana. Things went off the rails pretty quickly. What this story needs more than anything is a strong beta-reader and/or an excellent editor. Let me give you some examples of the writing: - "Her moma told her on one of her good days where [WHEN] she was speaking" - “She’d only imagined and this reality far outweighed her imagination” The same word twice in one sentence? Nawww, please don't. - “The universe had done her a solid with this girl.” A sheltered girl who rarely spoke to anyone other than her mother (who almost never spoke) would never think ‘done me a solid’??? Also, when is this supposed to be taking place? - “She looked sombre as fuck” cringe So cringe. Also, see above - “Tears tightened in her throat” Is that where her tear ducts are? - “He pushed down harder into her on the next thrust, the sound of clouds and heavy breathing and the wet slap of their skins the only sound in the room”Sorry, but what do clouds sound like?You get the picture. The writing is extremely weak. If you want to know what was redeemable about Gothikana, I can give you two things: (1) 'Little crow' might be one of the cutest pet names I’ve come across (2) RuNyx does well at writing monologues that are professions of the love interest's obsession: “This will last until the day roses on my grave stop sharing roots with the roses on yours,” he declared. “I will have you even in death, little witch. I am your beast. I am your madness. And you, you’re my afterlife.”
4509156669	4.5⭐️ This was my first RunYx book and boy did she deliver ! This was such a unique setting and storyline. I am obsessed with everything about it ! Vad Deverell is a little devilish thing and I loved him. The characters were very unique and I did not guess the plot, which for me is a huge bonus point !! The only reason I didn't give this book a 5 stars even though I was very much in love with it, is the use of 3rd person pov and some of the writing felt a bit off. The syntax and grammar use at certain point wasn't super well done and got me lost on a few occasion but because the storyline and the characters were lovely, it drawed be right back in. 3rd person pov is definitely not a favorite of mine but RuNyx made it work for this story. Again, it was just some of the sentence's structure that were off for me and I don't know if it's a translation problem or not but it does seem like it might have been that.Otherwise, I highly recommend this book if you haven't seen me post enough tiktok videos about it ahahhaha. I'm excited to read more from the lovely RuNyx and see more from this universe potentially.
7921047263	So yeah… that was not for me at all 😬I cringed so many times. The MMC made me cringe soooo many times!! So that’s definitely a NO for me.I wanted to like it so bad. I love dark romance, dark academia vibes, and on top of that it had the forbidden love trope. Like, are you kidding?? It should’ve been perfect! But this was… 😣 The forbidden love, imo, felt way too easy. Most of the mysteries, at the end of the day, were left unresolved. There was a lack of depth and development.As for the chemistry between Corvina and Vad… I just didn’t feel it. It all happened so quickly and without any buildup.Sorrryyy 💔
4340098871	This was the most perfectly gothic, spooky romance to read during October.Gothikana is dark academia, a forbidden romance between a professor and a student. I actually thought there would be an age gap but Corvina starts college at 21 and Vad, her professor, is a masters student himself at 27. It’s lust at first sight between these two – the chemistry between them is insane and they are so hot together. Corvina herself grew up in a unique environment. She was raised by her schizophrenic mother and homeschooled her entire life. Going to this school in the middle of nowhere is the first time she really gets to be around other people, meet new friends, and fall in love for the first time. We get a few chapters in Vad's POV – I wish we got more but I understand he had to be more of a mysterious hero. I really enjoyed the romance but my favorite part about this book was surprisingly the setting and the suspense. The way the author created the setting, making the school haunted, creepy, and spooky was so perfect. Every few years, a student goes missing and is never seen from again. Students have also died too - the last person who died was the girl who previously occupied Corvina’s dorm room and her bed. The book had me in suspense the entire read – I really had no idea who or what could be behind the disappearances and deaths.Was it paranormal or not? And what the heck happened at the end? I still don’t know, because even though one mystery is solved, there’s an entire other part of the plot that we don't get answers for. Which I'm not too happy about, but I still did enjoy this book a lot!
5384416965	Це було досить дивно, містично, похмуро, але захоплююче. Інтрига продовжувалася до кінця книги. Я точно не очікувала хто виявиться головним злодієм, це було несподівано. В деяких моментах мені хотілося зробити рука-лице, особливо читаючи ситуацію на балу, я сиділа з круглими від шоку очима і з нервовим сміхом. Стосунки головних героїв також були дивними, особливо на початку, я все думала, коли вони нарешті доберуться до ліжка, а то як не в машині, то в лісі🤣, при тому що героїня була абсолютно недосвідченою.В кінці лишилося багато питань без відповіді, хотілося більше конкретики.Але незважаючи на це книга мені сподобалася, неможливо було відірватися від неї. Було декілька моментів, які хочеться виділити:🔸— Я поцілував би тебе в крові, Корвіно. Якби я мав шанс поцілувати тебе, коли тисячі привидів повстали з могил, я б поцілував тебе. Не сумнівайся у цьому.🔸Я не знаю, як усе між нами змінилося, але мені байдуже. Ти не самотня. Більше ні, — терпляче сказав він, люто дивлячись на неї. — Якщо щось подібне станеться, скажи мені. Якщо ти потребуєш допомоги, скажи мені. Якщо ти потребуєш втіхи, скажи мені. Все що потрібно. Я стану єдиним безумством усередині тебе, розумієш?🔸— Це триватиме доти, доки троянди на моїй могилі не перестануть ділитися корінням з трояндами на твоїй, — заявив він. — Я буду з тобою навіть по смерті, маленька відьма. Я твій звір. Я твоє безумство. А ти, ти моє потойбічне життя.
4234080343	✨Book Review✨⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌶🌶Gothikana by @authorrunyx literally unlocked a side of romance books I NEED in my life now. Not only is this a great read but the physical book itself is a work of art! There are hauntingly beautiful photos throughout the entire novel and even a music playlist to set the mood. The author set the aesthetic and nailed it! It’s dark academia, gothic, mysterious, spooky, & paranormal with the perfect amount of spice. The story is amazing, bringing our main character into a cursed academy surrounded in superstition, mystery and murder. A forbidden love blooms between our main character and her young professor but it’s so much more than that. When murders start happening at the academy it takes both of these perfectly imperfect people and a whole lot of nerve to put the pieces together. I was on the edge of my seat the entire book. The plot twist at the end… I never even remotely saw coming. Jaw dropped! I absolutely loved this book and it easily made my favorite stand alones from last year!

4057740477	4 Gothic Stars University of Verenmore is a place filled with students who all have an unsettling past of their own. Corvina Clemm, the girl with purple eyes and raven hair has been an outcast most of her life. At 22, she tries to earn a living by making jewellery, candles and doing readings from her tiny cottage until one day she gets a letter from a mysterious university called Verenmore, offering her a full scholarship ride for their undergraduate program. Corvina believed the letter of acceptance had come as a sign from the universe, as she had been homeschooled by her mother and wanted to experience a school life where she could socialize with other people and be at a place where no one knew anything about her.There Corvina meets a mysterious, guarded man named Vad Derevell, who is a teacher and a student doing his doctorate. Both Corvina and Vad are instantly drawn to one another. The witch with purple eyes and the devil with sliver eyes, can’t seem to stay away from one another no matter how hard they try. “That’s not a look you give your teacher, little crow.”“That’s not a name you call your student,” she retorted quietly, wanting to use a special name for him as well but knowing that vocalizing it would make it much more real. “How am I looking at you?” she tilted her head curiously. His eyes seared her. “Like you’re inviting me to play.” She wasn’t the only one. Her breath hitched. “You look at me like that too, Mr. Deverell.”Surrounded with unexpected deaths, ghosts from the past, Corvina starts unveiling some of the mystery’s regarding the university as well as tries to figure out who Vad really is and if he has something to do with the mysterious disappearance and deaths happening in Verenmore.This is a gothic, suspense romance novel that will leave you craving for more.When I finished the book I had 10000000 questions running through my head, so many unanswered questions 😭😭 I can’t wait for what more this world has in store for me!
6096147704	Cómo que romantizar el estudio no es enamorarse del profe
7809919447	Is it possible to have too much of a good thing? This erotic-horror-romance-fantasy certainly tests that theory when a secluded daughter of a witch is recruited by a mysterious Hogwarts-like university known for mysterious disappearances. A brooding young professor always seems to be nearby when a dead body turns up, making him a prime suspect. But our schizophrenic (or spiritually connected) heroine can't resist his devilish allure and big you-know-what. Soon they're fucking all over campus and he's possessed all aspects of her life. Is this heaven, or the spider's web?I love every trope this novel plays with. But all of them together? A bit dizzying, to say the least. About halfway through I gave up trying to make sense and just let it do its thing. Plant-based mesmerism? Sure, why not. Prophetic daydreams? No problem. Multi-voice schizophrenic episodes? Girl, I get it. And God bless the audiobook reader who handled it all like a champ.If you're looking for all the smut and intrigue of a seven-book romantasy crammed into a single volume, this one should do it. While a slower pace would probably make more narrative sense, I do appreciate not having to wait "until book 5" for something to happen. The fantasy elements aren't too otherworldly, so if you're looking for truly fantastical characters this may disappoint. But Gothic lovers will appreciate all the love for the genre that's apparent throughout.I doubt I'll go around championing Gothikana as a must-read, but I can't say I didn't have fun.
5157634416	Full review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsJD...This book is a y/n x young voldemort my immortal fanfic and I will not explain myself any further
4054843433	It's not lightly that I say this:Gothikana is already one of my top favorite books of 2021! Facts!Runyx created such an unique and incredible world, with complex characters and multiple layers to be slowly peeled, one by one, with classy and contentment. I'm amazed with her talent! Truly!Corvina is an amazing character, full of good energy, innocence, and an intense desire to discover herself, after living her whole life like a recluse with her mother.Vad is the devil we love... He's Corvina's teacher at her new exclusive and secluded university, but he's also a mistery that she can't help but lust after... And O.M.G. how full of lust they are!The chemistry between them... The sex scenes... Their development as a couple and as individuals... All the side characters...You name it, and I sure as hell, love it!This book mix mistery with paranormal, sex with romance, suspense with drama, and everything is soooo well built, so perfectly fitted, that my only complain is that it comes to an end! I wish it wasn't a standalone, because I'm completely obsessed with this book and this world.I honestly can't start to describe all the gothic and supernatural vibe of this story without giving too much away, and although there's a lot of things to be said about it, I think that everyone should dive in blindly. Just buckle up and enjoy the ride!Gothikana is Runyx reaching up another level and I'm definitely hooked!
7197610468	5 stars ☆ "This will last until the day roses on my grave stop sharing roots with roses on yours, I will have you even in death, little witch. I am your beast. I am your madness. And you, you are my afterlife."This is the first book I’ve read by RuNyx and it does not disappoint. I’ve been so captivated by the story to know about the mystery aspects so it was literally a page turner. The plot amazed me to be honest since it’s nothing to any books I’ve read and so freaking unique. I’ve also gone through this blindly which was why I enjoyed reading this. It would be on my favorite reads this year for sure.The chemistry between Vad and Corvina. I want that. THEIR TENSION?!!! AHHHH I just love them so sooo much. And every spicy scene of them was sooo good. Whenever it came up I always say “oh to be fucked by Vad” 🥲"You're my mountain, my Vad. I don't know how I understand why, but somehow, I'm building my castle on you.""Build your castle, Corvina, I'm not going anywhere. Build your castle as fucking high as you want."I fell in love with RuNyx writing and would definitely read her other books.
4841648743	this book was honestly so fucking good. like I loved it. Vad & Corvina were so interesting and just sort of a breath of fresh air. I don't think I have ever read characters quite like them. I also loved the suspense/mystery aspect of this book. One second I want all the answers at the end and the next I want to keep some things unknown. Just know when you read this, you're going to have questions at the end and if that bothers you, don't read this one. It isn't necessarily a cliffhanger since there isn't a plan for a second book, it just leaves things open-ended.And y'all the spice in here 🥵 excuse me while I take a breather because god dayum.
4666919704	Here's the thing, if I had not read Nocticadia by Kerri Lake I would have loved this. But, I did read Nocticadia and this just doesn't reach that level. I liked the story but, some things were left unresolved or just didn't make much sense to the crux of the story. I didn't see the plot twist which was awesome but, I didn't really believe the romance between Vad and Corvina. It was a bit too insta love for me. I enjoyed Verenmore and the atmosphere and the gothic vibes were indeed strong but, I just needed more. I also didn't really feel the dark academia vibes that I wanted which is sad considering the setting of the story. I didn't hate the book and I am not mad I read it. It was fast paced and the story itself was addicting. I think it's just this book doesn't hold up against previous Gothic/Dark Academia books I have read and loved.b
4508827414	3.5 StarsVerenmore is a strange place that has enlisted students who come from special backgrounds and Corvina is one of them. There are rumors about this place like it’s haunted, people killing themselves, going missing… Corvina is a loner but she is an observer; she enjoys people-watching… This was an opportunity for her, a new beginning, in a place where nobody knows her and her past. She wants to belong and to be loved…Vad, the silver-eyed devil is there too, he’s dangerous. Girls he interacts with dance with death sooner than they should and now his eyes are on Corvina but for what purpose and can they fight with this madness between themselves?Told in dual POV, 3rd person, it can be read as a standalone novel. This was my first read by this author. It started off really good but towards the ending, I got bored a bit. I think it could have been better if there were fewer sex scenes and more about the plot. Don’t get me wrong the plot was interesting but it still had the potential to be better. It has dark elements but I would have enjoyed it more for sure if it was a bit darker. Even though the plot was slow-paced, the romance was based on insta-attraction. All in all, it wasn’t bad by all means but it wasn’t that good either, hope you enjoy it!
4060526368	4 stars 🌑The story takes place at the University of Verenmore and this university is fucked up. People have been going missing every 5 years for the past century and no one knows why. The university is also plagued by rumors of human sacrifice and murder. Corvina Clemm (h) is a new student here and feels very out of her element until she meets her professor, Vad Deverell (H). Corvina pursues a relationship with Vad, despite every. single. person. telling her he’s dangerous. But don’t worry people, it doesn’t matter because he’s FINE AS HELL. Together, Corvina and Vad will screw their way to the answers of some of the mysteries affecting Verenmore.I feel like that was a pretty good synopsis. Proud of it⚠️ SMALL SPOILERS BELOW ⚠️ Corvina not like other girls Clemm Although I really liked the heroine, she did give off those ‘I’m not like other girls’ vibes. She’s super ‘edgy’ and ‘different’ because she wears chokers and reads tarot cards. I know, this is harsh. Though she was kinda cool and wasn’t one of those heroines that expected other characters (specifically male) to come to her rescue. The girl literally jumped into a nasty ass lake where over a dozen bodies were pulled from in order to save a girl. I would never, sorry to that girl Vad professor of dirty talk Deverell This man is ✨spicy✨. He has premature grey hair, he wears glasses, and he’s got a big di- heart ”You chose the wrong guy for your first time, little crow,” he muttered to her…”but it’s too late now…I’m going to fuck you so raw you’ll never get me out. This time is mine. This pussy is mine.” And also, ”You’ll walk to your tower with my come inside you…and tomorrow, when you start doubting this again, feel your sore pussy and remember who owns it.” Lawd have mercy 👴🏼🕶🤏🏻Vad is also super mysterious and you really never know where he stands in the story till the end. He’s super evasive and vague with his answers and that makes the heroine and other characters question his loyalty The romance The only real complaint I have with this part of the story is that I wish the tension between the MCs last longer. They got together so quickly that the tension didn’t get the opportunity to build up. As you may have read, the book wasn’t lacking in the smut department so I wouldn’t worry too much about that. The ending I honestly can’t tell if this is a standalone or not. The ending was a bit of a cliffhanger and the author kinda suggested there could be more. I love that the author made it seem like they lived happily ever after and then wentPetition for Ajax to get his own book
5029866581	I. Am. Obsessed. With. This. Book. The way mental illness is handled? PHENOMENAL. The haunted aspects? PHENOMENAL. The spice!? PHENOMENAL. Corvina is SUCH a badass, I love her whole aesthetic tbh. And Vad!? PLS. SO HOT. I was kicking my feet and giggling whenever he got all possessive. What can I say, I love a good red flag.
5864116217	Anytime I can be transported to a dark, gloomy, spooky castle is it for me. Throw in some forbidden romance and I’m hooked. The vibes were vibing, ya know?
6848864075	Определено “Готикана” беше едно ново преживяване за мен като читател! Хем ме побиваха тръпки и въображението ми започна да играе, хем не исках да я оставя и исках да разбера как ще се развият оношенията между главните ни герои.Вад Деверъл - как да не го харесаш?! Преподавател по литература, чудесен пианист и много мрачен и харизматичен! Корвина - аутсайдер, които чува гласове в главата си и гледа на карти таро. Интересна комбинация.Химията между двамата беше взривоопасна - а пикантните сцени - скандали! Като стигнете до тази с пианото - ще ме разберете! Не успях да предвидя финала, което е още един плюс към книгата! И едно от най-хубавите неща са цитатите преди всяка нова глава.
4211799996	Genre: Gothic RomanceType: Standalone POV: Third PersonRating: Being isolated and homeschooled all her life, Corvina Clemm didn’t know what to expect when she was offered a place at the elusive University of Verenmore. It certainly wasn’t Vad Deverel, the mysterious teacher with a sinister reputation. And with Verenmore history, his attention wasn’t the only thing she needed to worry about.This book first caught my attention with the dark and mysterious looking cover. I’m glad to say the story mirrored the atmosphere perfectly. I was in love with the castle and its dark mystery. I liked the story and how it unfolded. However, it would have been more satisfying if some of the major questions were answered. “I will have you even in death, little witch. I am your beast. I am your madness. And you, you’re my afterlife.” Vad was very sexy and enigmatic while Corvina was eclectic and a little kooky. Together, their sexual tension was explosive.Gothikana is a tale of self-discovery. It would appeal to readers who enjoy a forbidden Romance in an atmospheric gothic setting. 📚 💀 📚 . . .

She knew how to do unusual things, and normalcy was never a part of her life.At the age of 21, Corvina receives an invitation to attend Verenmore University.She had never heard of this university before, but she wasn’t about to pass up the opportunity to finally experience real campus life, even if she’s older than most of the other students.When Corvina arrives, she finds a remote, mysterious castle hidden deep in the mountains — so isolated that even her taxi driver warns her about it on the way there. And as the rumors say, Corvina soon discovers that death and secrets lurk within Verenmore walls.Vad is a mysterious professor at the university. Corvina is drawn to him and realizes he may hold the answers to her questions about Verenmore. Vad prefers to keep himself a closed book and to know exactly everything that happens on campus.Corvina is a unique and compelling character. I loved how she represents so many young romance readers — she’s different, intelligent, and I especially appreciated how she questions whether she’s going insane, or if it’s just this place itself.I really loved the dynamic between Corvina and Vad. It was so mysterious, dark, and intriguing. They shouldn’t be together, but a decades-old mystery sends chills down your spine and forces them to connect. I could truly feel the taboo in this relationship, and it definitely gave me chills in a good way.I also loved the mystery woven into the plot, the sharp twists — how horror could suddenly creep in with the blink of an eye.The writing was incredibly detailed, which made it easy for me to vividly imagine every scene.The only thing I didn’t like was that not all of my questions were answered in the end. I would kill for a sequel.If you’re looking for a dark romance that will give you chills and thrills while reading — this is the book for you.
5473396090	This is my first book from RuNyx and I'm blown away. I've recently had a few disappointing reads and this was the perfect book to get me out of my reading slump! Corvina, our violet-eyed FMC, receives a letter from the secretive school of Verenmore. Cor has a rather unconventional upbringing, but I loved watching her character develop throughout. Vad is both a teacher and a student at the school, and from the moment these two cross paths sparks fly! I will say I enjoyed Vad more before we knew too much about him. It's something about the mystery and the angst I guess... I loved the mystery behind Verenmore, and I will say all of my guesses were completely wrong. There were quite a few questions left unanswered which I'm not a big fan of but the ending was cute enough for me to forgive RuNyx for that. I wouldn't be mad if she decided to do a book 2 to answer some of these questions though *hint hint*. Overall, a fun dark(ish) romance with a dash of mystery. If you love a dark student-teacher romance with some mystery, I would highly recommend! Tropes: -Forbidden love-Teacher-student relationship-Mystery-Betrayal
5923622790	I don't think one significant thing happened plot wise the whole story.. I liked Vad and Corvina. Vad was mysterious and strikingly attractive in my head! Corvina was quirky. I loved her witchy vibes. The voices she heard were interesting. But it felt like literally nothing happened to keep me intrigued.. bleh, I was expecting more by the 60% mark, but it just ended up lacking for me. The plot twist at around 85% was unexpected but uneventful. Idkkkk.
4185882452	DNF at 60%I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t. This book is the perfect example of a toxic relationship. There is literally no romance. just cringe smut and cringe writing and cringe characters. 🤢 I wish I could bleach this book from my memory.I really wonder do people find this kind of relationship romantic? honey you need to see a therapist
4060966202	Reread still just two stars When it comes to teacher student romances teach can’t be playing with students in the past… ain’t looking for a man with a pattern here I swear to fucking god I’ve never read a more boring book Trying sooo hard to be edgy and gothic than this one
