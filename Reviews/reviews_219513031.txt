7380019499	5⭐️read! Omg I want more! Like right now!! This story is amazing, the world building the characters the details the back story all of it. I’m officially obsessed with this I need the next book like right now. Academy of Villains is exactly what it sounds like, you get mystery and a lot of questions In my opinion things pick up quickly. What had me sold on this was the description it’s definitely Slytherin-coded and I loved every moment of it! It’s a dark fantasy romance that takes place in a school what more can you ask for? Oh and there’s the MMC whose name is Lucian who you’re gonna end up falling in love with! The MFC Kiara's is 🤌🏻 she’s a strong independent person, you’re gonna be rooting for her for this whole book There’s secrets, a love story, and trials. I would recommend this to anyone who loves magic, fantasy, and romance that involves enemies to lovers and of course Slytherin or anything that feels like Harry Potter this is for you guys. Thank you NetGalley and the author ever king for allowing me to be an arc reader for this I’m glad I got to experience this world and the characters I can’t wait for book two!!
7221878751	Thank you so much Netgalley and Ever King for an ARC of this book!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: LOVED the book and I'll be thinking about it for a long time.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: A fantastic read and would recommend it for most people.⭐️⭐️⭐️: It was a decent book, but something about it didn't meet expectations.⭐️⭐️: Didn't really enjoy it.⭐️: Did not like it at all and probably wouldn't recommend.In a kingdom where magic is fading, an evil king expands his control, destroying towns while using orphaned children as assassins in his army. Mages are sent to a brutal academy to train their powerful magic. Kiara, one of the king's assassins, uncovers she has magic and joins forces with some of these students to stop the king. Inside the academy, she discovers secrets about the prince, shadow organizations, and a dark headmaster. As students vanish and heartstrings return, Kiara’s fight for justice becomes a battle between love and survival.Absolutely loved this book! It’s like Harry Potter vibes, fast-paced, full of action, and with a dash of dark academia! I loved the characters and the enemies to lovers storyline. The main FMC is a badass and the MMC is mysterious, conflicted, and full of those sweet moments. There are deadly trials, mysterious characters, and secrets waiting to be discovered. Can’t wait for the next book, Lessons in Loyalty, definitely pick this one up if you enjoy Greek mythology, dark academia, and forbidden love!
7040259288	my rating: ★★★★aesthetic: 💫🗡️🌲🧚🏼‍♂️💀📿🏛️🐦‍⬛🏰👑📔A captivating entry in the dark academia fantasy romance genre, blending elements of Greek mythology with a magical academy setting. The story follows Kiara, a former assassin with a hidden magical gift, as she infiltrates a dangerous magic academy with the mission of assassinating Prince Lucian, a cursed royal whose life is entwined with the kingdom’s dark secrets.The atmosphere of the academy is immersive, steeped in mystery, danger, and enchantment. The vivid world-building introduces a compelling magic system, and secret societies, all contributing to an engaging and suspenseful backdrop. Fans of series like Harry Potter or Throne of Glass will find familiar yet refreshing echoes in the setting and tone.The romance between Kiara and Lucian is central to the narrative. Their relationship is fraught with tension, balancing between enemies-to-lovers tropes and genuine emotional depth. Kiara’s moral conflicts and Lucian’s enigmatic, protective nature add layers to their dynamic. However, their bond occasionally feels rushed, leaving some emotional beats less impactful than they could be.While the novel succeeds in delivering gripping moments and a rich atmosphere, it sometimes stumbles with pacing, especially in its exposition-heavy sections. The secondary characters and their involvement in secret societies like the Raven Society show promise but could have been further explored for greater narrative depth.Overall, Academy of Villains is a solid start to what promises to be a thrilling series. Its dark academia vibes and romantic intrigue are sure to resonate with fans of magical school settings and morally complex characters. This book offers an enjoyable read and sets up an exciting foundation for future instalments.
7204118397	This book had me from the very first page. I devoured it in 2 days, I couldn't put it down.It's a dark fantasy romance inspired by greek mythology filled with magic, curses and intrigue. I loved the magic system in this one. Similar to Zodiac Academy where they don't know their magic ability until it's revealed during some kind of ceremony. Kiara our FMC is a magicless Nameless assassin hired to kill the cursed prince to end the royal bloodline and the curse plaguing their evil king and kingdom. While sneaking into the academy to fulfill her task, she discovers she's a mage. Not just any mage, a starmage, a powerful line long thought to be extinct which sends the academy into chaos. I love that it's dual POV, so you get the prince's perspective as well. Prince Lucian is a shadowmage who's dark magic is instantly drawn to Kiara, even though she's trying to kill him every chance she gets. I love their connection and growth throughout the book and cannot wait for the next one!Read if you like:🗡️ enemies to lovers🗡️ villain gets the girl🗡️ magic academia🗡️ secret societies🗡️ cursed kingdom🗡️ I came to 💀 you but fell in love🗡️ shadow daddy🗡️ fade to black🗡️ slow burn🗡️ fated mates🗡️ hidden powersThank you Netgalley and Ever King for this eArc in exchange for my honest review.
7736454316	This book was what I needed! OMG 😩🔥 thank you Ever King for reaching out to me to read Academy of Villains! This book has been high on my never ending TBR list and glad I had the chance to read this!This book was literally everything to me like this is so Harry Potter but darker with a mixed of Greek Mythology! Light against dark done in its own unique way! So unique and special and the magic system!? Are you kidding!? The battle scenes were my absolute favorite!I haven’t read books that have grimoires in it and Ever King did amazing describing this in her story as it really was unique and brought out your imagination! My soul was shattered and brought back to pieces throughout this entire book and I cannot wait to move onto book 2 cause I can already tell this is my next new Roman Empire 🤭Also! Lucien and Kiara are my absolute favorite! The way this man describes Kiara in his chapters was so heartwarming and I felt the yearning in here! He is so head over heels and in love with this woman!I can’t wait to move onto book 2!
7418952328	Thank you NetGalley, Ever King, and the publishers for the ARC in exchange for my honest opinion. Kiara, an assassin for an evil king, sneaks into an academy for the magical in order to kill the prince and end the royal bloodline. But it doesn’t go as planned and she ends up in the middle of a magical ceremony. The new students are finding out what kind of magic they can weld. She’s got the kind of magic that was supposed to have been wiped out by the prince’s family. What was supposed to have been an easy in and out mission turns into a battle of survival and heart strings. It was an entertaining read for sure. My only complaint is the pacing was sometimes off and some of the writing.

It may as well define it for all of romantasy, and it reminded me why I love this trope so much. It’s the idea that your perfect match is out there, completing you in every way - and honestly what could be more romantic than that? •• “𝘔𝘢𝘺𝘣𝘦 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘰𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘩 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳.

There’s a nice build up and lots of internal conflict on both their ends that really made their relationship arc beautiful. They may fight that fate for different reasons, but once Lucien falls he never looks back and I absolutely ate up his protective and slightly possessive ways. He loves Kiara in such a pure way and it really was a breath of fresh air. •• “𝘠𝘰𝘶’𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘧𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦, 𝘒𝘪𝘢𝘳𝘢,” 𝘐 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘰 𝘩𝘦𝘳. “𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘐’𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘴𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘧𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘢𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘪𝘯”I really enjoyed the academy setting and the air of mystery around it, but do wish we got more of the magic system. I was questioning how some things worked, but this is set to be a longer series so hopefully we learn more along the way. Each book continues the main plot but features a different couple and I’m excited to get to know more of these characters as well. As a group, they are left in a bit of a mess at the end but the happy ending with our main couple will have you feeling warm and fuzzy despite the looming darkness ahead.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁:•𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝗺𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴•𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻 𝗳𝗺𝗰 •𝗖𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗺𝗺𝗰•𝗠𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗮𝗰𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗺𝘆•𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 •𝗙𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗲
7013094996	“In that moment, it hits me - he was the darkness I craved, and I was the light he couldn’t escape.”✅ Enemies to lovers ✅ Rich world building ✅ Unique magic system ✅ Likeable badass FMC✅ Obsessed shadow daddy MMCThis was a magical and fun journey and I found the plot gripping and the writing immersive. The vibes are definitely giving Harry Potter mixed with Zodiac Academy and I loved the unique magic system and well established characters and relationships. The romantic part of the story felt natural and well developed and I loved the enemies to lovers trope. This was very much a fade to black romance but that’s what I expected going in, and it was very tastefully done. I did find that there were certain parts of the story that felt slightly rushed and could have been further developed, but this didn’t happen often and overall I found the story flowed well and I certainly can’t wait for the next instalment!Thank you to the publishers and to NetGalley for the ARC!*UPDATE* I was lucky enough to be given a revised BETA copy of this book by the author and I can confirm that the changes have made this book even better! The story feels better paced with much more detail and development where it felt slightly rushed before. I’m so engrossed in the world building and cannot wait for book 2 even more now. Thank you to Ever King for the revised copy. This series is truly going to take off I’m sure of it!
7019905793	First off, thanks for the ARC!The cover caught my eye, and then the annotation intrigued me too. It's a cool concept, so keep developing it!She’s supposed to kill the prince but accidentally ends up in an academy where she discovers she’s a mage. Then she decides to go undercover, but things don't go as planned.I liked the atmosphere, even though everything seemed to move pretty fast, especially the quick spark between them, despite the slow burn (I love slow-burn relationships, with lots of hate stages). I didn’t really feel the "enemies to lovers" vibe since he felt drawn to her right away, but I was still reading with this face: 😏🤭I enjoyed the mythology in the story, so that’s a plus.I also liked that magic comes from grimoires, there are secret societies, and a few hot guys, plus the love ties are a bit unusual.Unfortunately, by the end, I wasn't really dying to find out what happens next.I expected to see more of the academy stuff, classes, and teamwork to witness the creation of a family that's not blood-related. There’s a bit of dark academia, but it didn’t give off Harry Potter vibes. Sure, there’s sorting and school stuff, but also it lacked a villainous atmosphere.- Easy to read- Academia - Love connections- From "gotta kill you" to "you’re mine, I’m yours"- Trials- Shadow daddy 🏫🗡❤️‍🔥✨️🌑3.5/5⭐️1/5🌶
7781774464	5/5⭐️ UGHHH LUCIEN IS JUST TOO GOOD OF A MAN TO BE TRUE 🥺
7081618363	This reads like a book written by a teenager, for teenagers. The constant inner dialogue from the two main characters is unbearable and the MMCs use of poetic declarations just feels icky and copy and pasted from other fantasy romance genres without any actual context, relationship development or reason for feeling that way. To start with the book feels like you’re dropped into book 2 and have no idea what’s going on. There is no world building, no explanation as to why events are happening. The two MCs have to go to a temple to complete trials, why do they have to? What are the trials? Why are the trials so easy and one page long? We finally get some vague context as to what the curse is at the literal end of the book but it still doesn’t explain in full why the curse happens to begin with. I spent the entire book trying to guess why tf everything was happening. We’re expected to ship the love interest based on the fact that they share a heart string and therefore should be in love. There is zero relationship development, the characters spend zero time together before the “trials” and the MMC is at this point supposed to be smitten and the FMC supposed to be easily swayed. There is zero chemistry between them. The characters themself are extremely shallow with no background or character development except for “he falls first” and “she is closed off but now opens up to him” smh I can’t with this nonsense. The annoying part is this book actually had potential. The concept of heartstrings, and the grimoires and the magical ability classes could have actually been good if well developed. The class was giving defence against dark arts vibes but just as it was getting interesting there was no more classes. I honestly can’t believe I finished the entire book, I wanted to get my moneys worth, but dear god that dialogue was horrendous.
6986823229	The book reminded me of elements from Harry Potter and Powerless, yet it has its own unique qualities and a complex world that truly sets it apart. The story kept me hooked, and I was always eager to find out what would happen next. The pacing is quick, with little room for slow or boring chapters, which makes it easy to stay engaged.This is a great choice for readers who enjoy “enemies to lovers,” a light romantasy, and a fated romance dynamic.While I did feel that a few more chapters dedicated to world-building and character backstory would have enhanced the experience, I still really enjoyed the journey and look forward to continuing with the second book once it’s released.
7137231708	The school is like Hogwarts and the magic system (and vibes) is similar to Zodiac Academy but then add a Greek mythology retelling. I definitely enjoyed this book but found myself wishing it was longer or split into two books so there could’ve been more detail about the school and trials. Though, this probably stems from my lack of knowledge surrounding Greek mythology. I will say the tidbit at the end with all the “Did you know” facts was extremely enlightening! Overall, I throughly enjoyed this book and can’t wait to read the next one.
7730617585	⭐️4.5 rounded up! MINOR spoilers.I’m actually so surprised by the number of ARC reviewers who didn’t care for this book, but to each his own! I also received this as an ARC and am leaving my honest review.📚 dark academia 📚 assassin FMC📚 shadow daddy📚 royal curse📚 trials📚 enemies x lovers lite🌶️ 1/5 (but the tension and yearning 🤩)Dark academia totally speaks to me, so I was super excited to jump into this book. Now, did I think it was absolute perfection? No. But was it an amazing vibes read for me? Absolutely! I didn’t want to put it down. While some reviewers were critical of Kiara’s (FMC) mostly unexplained transition from assassin to student, I feel a little bit like let fantasy be fantasy on that one. She ends up being the most powerful type of mage, thought to be extinct, with wild untamed abilities. Can we just imagine that perhaps a magical academy was more focused on this monumental discovery than her admissions paperwork? Let’s send a curse breaker home? I wish Kiara was proven to be a better assassin though. Being bested by Lucian (MMC) is one thing, but her skills did seem subpar at times.Many of the characters and plot points in this book reminded me of characters and story moments from some favorite reads of mine, in a positive way. Why do people get mad when there’s similarities? If you have a favorite ice cream, do you refuse to eat it from more than one shop? Why not indulge again? Someone may just have a different approach to your favorite flavor. An ophaned assassin, a cursed king, a prince with shadow magic, fates intertwined - 💜I just loved Kiara and Lucian’s relationship and I deeply wanted this to not be a YA book. Their energy had me thinking spice would be on the next page! But spice aside, I also found elements of their relationship quite sweet. I appreciated the trust they built over the end of the book and the growing strength of their Heartstring. I will never not love the idea that light will always rise above dark and that love is the most powerful magic of all.I want more on their story. I want more on the Ravens. I want to find Octavia’s heartstring. I hope I will find it in the rest of the series! Thank you to the author for giving me an opportunity to read.
7039810956	First of all, thank you so much for the ARC! This is my first ARC review, and the author did not disappoint me at all. If you love Harry Potter, then you’ll absolutely love Ever King’s Academy of Villains—but be warned, this is a darker and more intense version of HP.This book belongs to the dark academia fantasy romance genre and is inspired by Greek mythology. The story revolves around the MFC, who is an assassin on a mission to break a curse that plagues her world, saving her people in the process. To fulfill her goal, she enters the Academy of Magic with one target: to kill the prince, who she believes is the son of the cursed king.Her encounter with the prince marks the start of an enemies-to-lovers trope that I absolutely adored. Their chemistry is amazing—sometimes it’s a slow burn, and other times it’s intense and fiery. As the story progresses, shocking truths about the MFC are revealed, and the adventure takes off with trials, challenges, and obstacles that keep you hooked.I have to highlight how much effort the author has put into building this magical world. The rationality behind the lore is impressive, and the world is filled with fascinating elements like grimoires, prophecies, incantations, duels, dark beasts, monsters, secret societies, trials, and even heartstrings (love ties). And, of course, we can’t forget the handsome prince and his smug, equally handsome friends. These elements kept me engaged from start to finish, always guessing what would come next.While I felt the ending was a bit rushed, Academy of Villains is still a fantastic read and highly recommended for dark academia lovers. I can’t wait to dive into the next book of the series to see what happens with Kiyara and Lucian!
7710932717	I love love loved this book. I didn’t want it to end, which is also why I postponed its reading and read it so so slowly. The way the characters have been built, the Greek mythology inspiration, the trials and tribulations they go through are very well written, and I really enjoyed the fact that the plot was both slow and also fast and tense. I do think there are a few pieces of the story still left in the open, and I hope that book 2 brings more light to all of them, and in saying this I cannot wait for book 2.The opinions in this review are mine alone, as I was lucky enough to be given an ARC of it through Netgalley. Great book overall, really enjoyed reading it, very sad it’s over now.
7753235428	I enjoyed this book. An assassin without a name. Only there to kill the prince, or so she thought.The weaving of Greek Mythology, meets Harry Potter academia, soul bonds, grimoires instead of wands, a curse on the kingdom.loved it!!
7224344384	˖ ⁺ ౿ ⚔️ ┆2 stars⤿ arc review first of all, thank you netgalley and the publisher for an arc in exchange for an honest review! <3okay so this wasn’t my favourite… there were some parts that were working, however there were some that were not. the plot was all over the place imo, and at times i was so lost as to what was even happening. there were plot holes and things that weren’t really explained—or not until the very end. like what did the trials that were suddenly sprung upon them have to do with the curse? the curse wasn’t even explained until the last 10% of the book. other things like that. basically there’s a girl who is an assassin hired to kill this prince. so she somehow sneaks into a magic academy, but discovers she has powers instead that she never knew about. i was intrigued by this, and there were some other interesting concepts, such as heartstrings, the nameless guild of assassins, merging their powers, etc. however i just felt like it wasn’t executed the best.the characters and world felt underdeveloped, i just couldn’t connect to them. it’s like it was trying to mimic harry potter but make it dark, which sort of worked? i also wasn’t the biggest fan of the dialogue. one of the characters literally said, “let’s show him what we’re made of!” i’m sry no💀maybe i should have dnf’d earlier but i will admit it was slightly entertaining at times, and i somehow managed to finish this. overall, i think there was definitely lots of potential, but the execution wasn’t the best in my opinion!that’s all, thank you for listening to my rant 🙏
7726660170	Make sure you clear your todo list because you are not going to want to put this story down. It has A strong FMC and a morally gray MMC,enemies to lovers with a touch her and die,secret societies,villain gets the girl,magic and potions, and every mage. I'm heading into the second book.
7520009536	Many thanks to Ever King and Netgalley for the eARC 💚When I tell you I devoured this book like I’m not even kidding, I ateeeee it up Five huge, shining gold stars to Ever King for this masterpiece - I loved every single thing about this book. From the characters, to the setting and imagery, to the slowww burn🔥 Tropes: assassin x prince 🗡️👑inspired by nyx x erebus 💚fated mates ❤️‍🔥light x dark magic ✨he falls first 😍trials♟️, secret societies 📜, dark academia 🏛️The plot: Kiara is an assassin of the Nameless and she is sent on a mission to assassinate Prince Lucian, the prince of Ithaka. But when things don’t exactly go as planned, and she ends up at the initiation ceremony for the new mages, she discovers secrets about herself that she never would have thought possible. She takes the opportunity to get closer to the prince, but soon she realises that things aren’t as simple as they seem; secret societies are unveiled and mysterious messages are revealed, and Kiara is forced to live with the one thing she had vowed to destroy. The characters: Kiara is the badass FMC we all love. She stayed true to herself no matter what, and despite all the obstacles in her way, she stuck to her mission (until she realised there’s a bigger one at play hehe). I loved her unwavering bravery and commitment to herself, and the fact that she didn’t drop everything the moment Lucian showed a bit of interest in her. It was also very refreshing to see a character that remained consistent throughout the book - even if she made a foolish decision or two, she would remain strong in the face of it and dealt with the situation accordingly. I also really, really appreciated that she didn’t resist her magic for too long (as that would’ve been super frustrating) and instead focused on honing it once she discovered how strong she was and how to control it. I also thought that it was absolutely amazing how she had celestial powers, the rarest kind, and that she was insanely powerful (and that her starlight magic was the perfect complement to Lucian’s shadow magic). Lucian is a shadowmage and not only is he the prince of Ithaka, but he’s also the KING of yearning! If his whole purpose in this book was to obsess over Kiara, I would be so fine with that. He came and he served looks and he got the girl in the end. Also, he’s part of a secret society AND he can control the darkness and shadows (and you thought he couldn’t get hotter). He also had a death wish because tell me whyyy he cooked up a whole candlelit dinner just to bait Kiara to come kill him😫😫 Anyway, his magic was really cool and I loved his banter with his friends. I also LOVEDDD how protective he was over Kiara and just wanted to take care of her and keep her safe ugh A GREEN FLAG??? Also, he is a member of the Raven Society, a secret society at the academy, alongside six of his friends and they work together to uncover the mysteries surrounding the school. My thoughts: If there’s a magic academy setting with a Slytherin coded MMC and a badass assassin FMC, you best believe i’ll be all over that🤭- I absolutely loveddd the lore in this book and the magic system. It was so easy to follow and understand, while still being super intriguing. - The dark academia, eerie, mysterious setting coupled with the magic and slow burn romance created the perfect balance. The academic setting was so much fun to explore (I just wish we’d gotten to see some more of the classes) and I really felt like I was immersed into the story and discovering everything as Kiara was. The slow burn was SLOW - but I really appreciated it because both characters remained consistent in their attributes; Kiara didn’t give in to Lucian’s flirting at all and was super reluctant to even be civil with him, which was completely characteristic of her. - Also, the references to Greek myths were so perfectly done and I absolutely cannot wait to read further in the series. - I also really appreciated the pacing of the book and the fact that the author incorporated trials and some sort of climax at the end, because of course the pacing was slower than you would expect since this is book one in an eight-part series, but despite that, I thought there was some sort of action throughout and never got bored even for a bit. - The side characters were all very interesting, especially Octavia and Kaspian (can’t wait to read their stories) and I loved getting to know each member of the Raven Society. This book had me absolutely enraptured from start to finish and I cannot wait to read the next book!
7053482190	At the very beginning, I loved this book. It was just hitting right. But then a lot of things started happening. Some of them felt aimless, some felt out of place, and one particular scene felt so out of character for one of the MCs. Moreover, I didn't feel like I knew the characters as people. Even though I knew their backgrounds and some thoughts, I still couldn't learn who they really were. The ending left me disappointed since all their trials didn’t have a sufficient payoff.Thank NetGalley, publisher and author for providing me with ARC copy
7081503905	Thank you to NetGalley and the author, Ever King, for a copy of this e-ARC. The worst assassin in the world attends the kingdoms boarding school for mages with an unbelievably slack security system and its very own Gossip Girl. The story starts off with our FMC Kiara on a mission to eliminate the Crown Prince, who resides in a school of mages. Somehow Kiara is able to just slip into this highly exclusive school of some of the most powerful magic users in the entire kingdom and lands in their version of a Hogwarts sorting ceremony. They mistake her for a student (how??) and she is revealed to also be a mage. She then just starts taking classes and only after a few days does the Headmaster ask her, ‘how did you get into this school?!’ 🤨 It started off pretty strong and I was entertained; it’s an easy book to read. This book is by no means a literary masterpiece and so I tried to just enjoy what it could offer me. However, as the story progressed there were various elements and plot holes that made me roll my eyes. The dialogue became pretty cheesy towards the end, with lines such as “Let’s show him what we’re made of!” said in earnest, during an intense fight sequence. Unfortunately, this book isn’t for me. The first red flag for me was at the end of the first chapter where, I shit you not, the MMC says “There you are. I’ve been waiting for you.” SOUND FAMILIAR??? Almost too uncanny. And you’d never guess what - he is also a shadow-daddy.
7005918008	Actual Rating: 4.5☆Academy of Villains is a dark academia romance inspired by Nyx and Erebus. The story begins with one of the Nameless hired to assassinate Prince Lucian at the Academy of Magic. She makes a careless mistake and finds herself at the sorting ceremony where the mages elemental magic are revealed. When she is called upon the platform, a stone pillar reacts to the magic she is unaware of even possessing. She is what she hates most, a mage. Kiara's element is celestial and believed to be eradicated many years ago. As Kiara learns how to use her magic, she awakens a magical thread that may alter her original mission. Kiara might need the prince alive to save the kingdom. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.The concept of this story was so interesting, and I enjoyed it way more than I was anticipating. This is a series I plan on devouring! I loved the magic system. The mages receive their grimoire based on their elemental magic. The grimoires start out blank, and when needed, the spells appear to the user of the grimoire. To everyone other than the owner of the grimoire, it stays blank. The mages elemental magic also has a beast form. I loved Kiara and Lucian's beast forms! The mages also have an affinity, for example, healing or being able to know when someone is being dishonest.Lucian is our shadow daddy, and I love him. He is respected as the prince and feared for his element. He is a Shadowmage. He possesses cursed, dark magic that he spent years learning to control. When he meets Kiara, his control falters. He was aware that Kiara was planning to assassinate him, and he was exhilarated. Like, this man had a fancy lamb chop dinner awaiting her, as if it were a date and not her sneaking into his room to assassinate him. As we get to know him, he is actually so sweet, caring, and genuine.The imagery during battles was beautifully written. I could easily visualize Kiara's celestial magic: her starblades slicing through the air, stars shooting down from the sky, exploding in a glowing light as they hit their opponents. I highly recommend this book if you love dark academia, trials, secret societies, and elemental magic.dark academia • dark fantasy • dark romance • enemies to lovers • greek mythology • magic • retelling • romantasy • secret society • self discovery • shadow daddy
7841067068	Academy of Villains Greek mythology retelling and honestly is the best one I've read so far. Ever King did an amazing job in the world-building and describing the characters and their growth throughout the book.We are met with Kiara our FMC. She is sent to the Academy to 💀 the prince. She is strong, relentless and smart. The MMC Lucian is my new favourite book boyfriend. I fell in love with him from the very first chapter. He was kind, protective, caring and he always put Kiara's needs first. Some of their Interactions made me giggle and some made me swoon. He believed in their relationship for both of them when Kiara hesitated.I liked the side characters as well. I can't wait to read about Octavia. Lucian is part of the secret society called the Ravens and we are met with Atticus, Bastian, Tobias, Edmund, Dorian and Kaspian.Every single one of them was different and I can't wait to read more about them. I liked Kaspian. He was witty, smart and unhinged 😁Thank you Ever King for allowing me to read this amazing book and I can't wait to read the next.Academy of Villains is available everywhere so make sure you go and check it.
6962074260	If you’ve ever wondered what Harry Potter would be like if the students were capable, and willing to kill each other, the ruling classes were totally corrupt by dark magics and there was sizzling sexual tension, look no further. Ever King’s Academy of Villains is a light bite of steamy (closed door) magical adventure, littered with captivating world building and bag loads of intrigue. We explore the Academy alongside Kiara, peeling back its deadly layers to find a prophecy that could change the world and love in the most unlikely of places. Bonded by fate, Kiara and Lucien must set aside their differences to save their world. I can’t WAIT to read more. Book Two when!?!
7850405059	✨️ Academy of Villains By Ever King ✨️Academy of Villains is a dark academia fantasy packed with forbidden magic, slow-burn romance, and enemies-to-lovers tension.The worldbuilding is lush and gothic, with a sentient school, powerful grimoires, and shadowy secrets. The main characters are both compelling, morally grey characters whose chemistry crackles on the page. The romance is swoony and intense, with just the right amount of angst.While some pacing issues and lighter mythological elements leave room for more depth, the story is gripping and addictive—a strong start to what promises to be an exciting series.
7795015984	How do you capture a reader’s attention? You kick things off with a bang, and Ever King does just that.This book is like a thrilling mix of Harry Potter and Black Clover, all wrapped up in a retelling of the Greek myth of Nyx and Erebus, with a touch of dark academia. If you enjoy fantasies filled with elemental magic, shadows, and a slow-burning chaos, then you’re in for a treat.The story centers around Kiara, an orphaned assassin who has been trained with a singular purpose: to eliminate Prince Lucian and break a long-standing curse. Lucian, a formidable shadow mage, is more complex than Kiara has been led to believe. From their first meeting, there’s an undeniable connection between them. He’s brooding, mysterious, and surprisingly tender towards her.What truly elevates this tale is their chemistry, which is ⚡️ . Their banter is intense, and their romance is slow-burning, filled with angst and magnetism. Interestingly, Lucian is the one who falls first. However, this isn’t just a love story. As secrets are revealed, deadly trials intensify, and a prophecy looms over them. The narrative is set in a dark academia environment, reminiscent of House Slytherin, complete with alchemy classes and beast mastery exams. Even as a Hufflepuff, I found it captivating.I only wished the deadly trials had lasted longer, as I enjoy seeing characters evolve under pressure. Ever King’s writing style brings every scene to life, making it feel like a movie in my mind.If you’re drawn to morally complex characters, elite magical schools, cursed princes, and assassin girls falling for their enemies, this book is a must-read.
7728745167	Greek mythology. Magical academy. Enemies to lovers. Yes, sign me up. I devoured this book and fell in love with the characters. Kiara and Lucian have my heart. I also am so excited to learn more about the side characters as they get their own books. The Raven Society bros are so interesting and the girls each have their own personalities too! We only get a taste of them in book 1, but the set up for more is great. If you crave magical vibes from Harry Potter but want something more college age, this is a fun light versus dark retelling!
7532133572	I’m totally here for the vibes of Academy of Villains! There’s almost nothing I love more than a Dark Academia with a unique magic system and characters I can’t help but love, and this checks all the boxes.Here's what you can expect:🔪 Stabby Assassin FMC🌚 Shadow Daddy🥀 Fated Mates (Heartstring bond)💔 Enemies-to-lovers🏰 Magic Academy🔒 Secret Societies📖 Grimoire Magic🔍 Solving Mysteries & Unraveling Clues🏛️ Greek mythology–inspired love storyWhen Kiara infiltrates the Academy to assassinate the Cursed Prince Lucian, she finds herself captured and having to improvise. Pretending to be a student during a choosing ceremony, Kiara shockingly discovers she has magic. The irony? Kiara despises mages more than anything. Yet, here she is, forced to live as one among her sworn enemies, totally spun around and trying to survive.The magic system is pure genius. Mages are sorted into powerful classes, and each one is gifted a grimoire that conjures the right incantation for battle or defense. Kiara’s no stranger to danger, but magic is a whole new game. She must master her spells on the fly, dodging the enemies who fear what she is, while still plotting Lucian’s downfall.Kiara is a total badass, but let’s talk about Lucian. He has that mysterious shadow daddy vibe, but as secrets unravel and his backstory comes into play, I found myself hopelessly rooting for him (and maybe swooning a little, too).Then, toss in secret societies, fated mates, and a quest that’s equal parts epic and deadly. The result is a spellbinding, twisty, utterly unputdownable adventure that left me staying up way too late until I devoured the entire book.
7925959526	Fast paced enough to keep interest. I liked the direction of the story and the setting. The romance was cute but i kinda felt it wasn’t as strong or complex as I would’ve liked. The ending was really good tho. im def gna be reading the next book for more bc the side characters are interestingggg.
7850561565	From assassin to magic weilder, Kiara never thought magic would chose her not when she's sent to kill the prince of the kingdom. But becoming something so much more than she ever hoped too. And finding love in the mean time is something she never seen coming.I read this book as a ARC reader for a honest review and I have to say this is one of the best books I've read in a while. The story building is great it keeps you entertained, and leads you in new adventures the romance is slow to build but it's perfect for this story. From assassin's to magic this book is a top five for me I really enjoyed it and recommend you read it.
7022921627	Thank you so so much to the author for sharing a copy of this book with me!!! “I’ve been hired to kill the prince”“There you are. I’ve been waiting for you”“It’s as if she’s concealing a dark secret, and I can’t resist the urge to uncover it”I wish I could say I am surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this book. The truth is … I am not. From the first page, from the first sentence and from the premise I knew it was exactly something I would have absolutely loved !!! And boy what a wild ride it was !!!! A dark academia, Greek mythology inspired, enemies to lovers fantasy romance with mages and shadow powers !!!! I loved reading the story of Kiara and Lucian. They were such a fun power couple to read about !!!! The tension between them was thick and it is a slow burn that will lead you to the ending before getting something different than hands touching. But those hand touching moments were like FIRE !!! And I wasn’t even sure if I wanted more. Every glances, every single inner thoughts one of them had (especially Lucian cause that guy knows what obsession is) felt priceless and I wanted more!!! Plus, the gothic academia vibes and setting and the journey they had to go through was so action packed and fast paced that I simply didn’t want to nor could stop reading!!!! I read this book in one sitting for goodness sake!!!! I picked it up and then I put it down only at the end!!!! To be fair, I’m such as suckers for stories like this one and when some of my favourite tropes were brought to life here (one bed, enemies to lovers and shadow powers) I simply could not deny my heart the experience it was craving!!! And after that ending … I need the next one already !!!! “For the first time in a long while, I feel truly free. I’m in control of my own fate. In control of my destiny”“I want her in ways that’ll erase that defiance, that hatred from her eyes. I want her to look at me differently. To see me. To want me. To need me. And I will make her look at me that way”“There’s something seriously wrong with me because the thought of her fighting only makes me want her more”
7419290440	I won this book through a Goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review. Thanks for choosing me. The second I read that people who love Harry Potter could possibly love this book, I knew I had to enter the giveaway. As a diehard HP fan and proud Gryffindor, I figured why not? I am beyond grateful to have entered and won the opportunity to read a new to me author and to have found a new series to fall into. I will be counting the minutes left until June 24! 🙂⏱️I felt like I entered the Slytherin House, Lucian Darkwing is Draco Malfoy in prince form. 👑💚 He's slightly misunderstood, and although he can be arrogant, he's intelligent and can be kind when he wants to be. Kiara is a badass. She's fearless, and her strength knows no bounds. I ate their story up. I absolutely loved the he falls first of it all. Her fight to avoid falling for him was similar to Violet and Xaden (another favorite series of mine). I loved the push and pull, and their back and forth was perfect for their story. Their determination was bold. Standing against your parents is never easy, but when your father happens to be king? Brutal. I can't wait to see how this series continues. I especially enjoyed that he didn't use his status or his title to force her into anything - truly a gentleman. The Raven Society has me on edge. I don't know whether to trust them or not, but I do like them. All of them. His posse and Octavia are amazing. I feel like I can trust her and have my fingers crossed that I'm not wrong about her. She welcomed Kiara to the academy with open arms and helped her through, so I'm hoping their budding friendship isn't tarnished by betrayal on either side as the series continues. I am happy to have discovered a new world, Ever King has done a magical job at bringing this world to life. Her characters are well-rounded, the world she's created is intriguing, and the way the story flows is easy to follow and fall into. I found myself wanting to read faster to know how it all went down but wanting to read slower so that I could savor it all. Like I said- magic. ✨️Here's hoping that more Heartstrings are revealed and that love really does conquer all. 💛🖤🤞
7044619641	Okay that was an amazing ride.Full review coming soon (updated)..5.🌟I love books that revolve around kingdoms, magic and greek mythology. So I had to request this ARC on @netgalleyThe book aspects:⚔️: the fantasy is a 5/5🪄: the magic system is a 4/5♥️: enemy to lovers, the romance is cute and charming 5/5🔥: There wasn't really spice in it (slowburn), well definitely some breathtaking kiss scenes. So 2/5👥: The characters are all amazing. The MC's were badass but Idk why Tobias has a special place in my heart (I will explain) 5/5Review 📄 :The first line of this book says it all "I've been hired to Kill the prince". Kiara, the nameless, the assassin has always hated the Cursed King and all the mages of the kingdom. So when she was hired to kill the prince and free the kingdom from the dark shadows that roams around it, she couldn't be more ready. As Kiara went to fulfill her assignment in the Academy where the prince stays, she was forced to undergo the sorting ceremony for new students. The result changed everything, if not for any, Kiara herself is a mage and not just any but one of the rarest that was believed to be out of existence. But despite that our badass MC was determined to kill the prince and save the kingdom, yeah because mages are still arrogant assholes. Kiara decided to stay as a student and understand everything about this academy, full of secrets, until she discovers that there is another way to save the kingdom with support of her enemy, the prince. Sadly only one of them is predicted to last, But who?.My opinion:As a potterhead I can approve that there was a little bit of Harry potter vibes in this, obviously the sorting ceremony. But I also felt a bit of Bridgeton vibe to be specific lady whishledown vibes, the gossip bubbles scene. As I mentioned above that Tobias has a special place in my heart, I kinda ship him with Kiara. I found their interaction scene cute and funny, all that "you are not mine but Definitely my type", I melted. You guys take lucien, Tobias is mine!!I need the next book rn!! I'm so excited to know more about the Raven society especially Tobias @authoreverking please fulfill my desires.
7028971188	Thank you NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review. academy of villains by ever king is the first in the fantasy series which is inspired by greek mythology. this story follows kiara, a nameless assassin with no magic, who has been tasked to infiltrate the magical academy to kill prince lucian whose family is linked to a curse that has plagued the lands that cost her her parents. she detests magic and mages for her loss and wants vengeance. however, in her efforts, she is forced into the mages sorting ceremony at the academy and discovers she is actually a mage herself and one of the most rare mages. while she keeps her true identity to herself, she is still onto her plan of killing lucian. she learns more about the academy, secret societies, how to wield her magic and finds herself conflicted with not only her mission and her hatred for all things magic but how she feels with her own magic and most importantly, the prince himself. this story amazed me from the get go. i honestly enjoy fantasy books set in dark, academic settings and throw in some greek mythology for extra layer of intrigue and… just wow. it’s fast paced with an amazing magic system and world building that feels so atmospheric. the trials at the end? on edge the entire time. kiara is a badass and strong-willed FC despite her tragic backstory which only adds to the layers of her. her indecision mixed in with self discovery was written so well as she learns more about her own magic and how it influences her mission. lucian made me giggle many times with his sarcasm and broodiness. he is intrigued by kiara from the beginning and wants to know who she is and what her intentions are. (bonus points for being a shadowmage). their chemistry was insane as they both juggling their motives and feelings, conflicting at many times. his protectiveness and her learning to accept his help? their back and forth? the development? just chefs kiss. overall, i am obsessed and i need the next one tomorrow.if you like harry potter, zodiac academy and throne of glass then this book should be on your TBR !!!
7008812442	Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Spice: 🌶Tropes: ✨ Enemies to lovers ✨ Forced Proximity ✨ Secret Society ✨ Cursed Prince x Assassin ✨ Dual POV✨ Magic Academy✨ Greek Mythology retelling I absolutely LOVED the fact that this felt like we were hanging out with Slytherins the whole time. It was so satisfying experiencing that as a fellow Slytherin and nostalgic as well. The bromance between Lucian and his friends as well was also top tier. I enjoyed it so much! And loved the Secret Society aspect as well. It was so cool how each mage was sorted and that each mage’s grimoire serves them only so no two mages would have the same spell. I loved it! It was such a different insight to magic that I don’t think has been covered before. As someone who is familiar with Greek mythology, I appreciated all the references sprinkled in there. This isn’t your typical magical academy book and there were lots of twists and turns that I was not expecting which I love! It kept me so engaged and unable to put it down (regretfully doing so as life always calls haha) I loved the pace of this. Each chapter had world building + plot + dialogue. We were always progressing each chapter. I wish this book was longer! There’s a hint at another book which I’m hoping so because I NEED to know what happens next! Plot: Kiara’s mission is to kill the cursed prince but it doesn’t go as planned and she finds herself stuck in the magical academy and discovering something about herself she didn’t think possible. Now she finds herself on a path of self-discovery but the issue of the cursed prince still remains. With a hesitation that wasn’t there before. That hesitation could cost her but with something unexpected discovered between them, could she still do it? The curse is more than she thought it was and runs far deeper. She discovers history and secrets at every turn…but which will she choose? Will she kill the prince or save the world with him? ** I received an ARC copy in exchange for a review. These thoughts are entirely my own.
7151847364	This is one of the most creative books I’ve read in a while! It was the perfect blend of nostalgia, novelty, cleverness, fantasy, mythology, and romance. I felt similar excitement and passion reading this to what I felt while getting into fantasy as a kid, a quite lovely feeling! AoV is for those of us who grew up obsessed with Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, but want fresh twists and new lore. It is advertised as YA but is written maturely enough to captivate adult readers as well. I was kept on my toes reading this book. Every chapter or two introduced new information that added layers of complexity. I was intrigued but not overwhelmed, and I kept turning pages because I couldn’t wait to find out more. The book ended in a fitting way for the first in a series; enough was resolved to be satisfying, with plenty of loose ends I am anxious to see investigated further in the sequel. I found close-knit friend group of the MMC refreshing and enjoyed seeing that kind of platonic support in a fantasy book. Additionally, the FMC has a friend I’m hoping plays a larger part in book two. This book lightly explores class/socioeconomic differences (in a fantasy context, of course) and how one’s upbringing affects their perspective. The magic system is familiar but unique- while this sounds contradictory, it makes sense if you’re a lifelong fantasy reader. AoV felt like coming home, but traveling too. If you want to know what I mean, you’ll just have to read it.😉 I am anxious for book two and can’t wait to see more from Ever King!Check this out if you like: -Dark academia -Greek mythology -light mystery-nature/elemental magic-PJ & the Olympians-Harry Potter🌶️- Spice: There are kissing/makeout scenes in chapters 29 and 35, and a fade-to-black in chapter 36. These scenes take up only a portion of these chapters.
7135996327	** spoiler alert ** After reading Academy of Villains by Ever King, I truly find my self itching for the next part of this story. The author’s writing brought to life the world they created. At the start of the story, the anticipation to discover more of Kiara’s background growing up in The Nameless was almost unbearable, but the way the author weaved parts of her past through her characters development was truly beautiful. Seeing the development in who Kiara is as she discovers her magic without falling into the ever tempting help of Prince Lucian was such a breath of fresh air from most fantasy books you read now. The strong character Kiara has drew me in, but even more so the desire, pull, and thoughtfulness Lucian had towards Kiara. His protectiveness and tension that builds with him at a JUICY pace was captivating. I also have to note how diverse each and every character introduced is. Each member of the Raven Society brought to light such different personalities that usually stay hidden in the background. I have to say my favorite might be Kaspian from his out of pocket behavior sometimes. As the journey for Kiara and Lucian began I knew the story was just getting started. This was an action packed, thrilling read that I was at the edge of my seat over. Seeing The Nameless come for Kiara and how Lucian was devoted to never letting them get her was captivating. And finally seeing Lucian let Kiara in completely was such a powerful moment. His vulnerability he gave to her willingly opened up the door for the two to finally build trust between them. When Kiara finally gained control of her powers and The Nightmare was born, I was covered in chills all over my body. This was a thrilling and phenomenal book with a world I would gladly jump into any day, given the chance. I can’t wait to see what develops for each of these characters.
7093342762	Tropes:Enemies to lovers Forced proximity Greek mythology Dark academia Dual POVMagic YA romance Forbidden secretsSecret societies Academy of Villains by Ever King is a dark, gripping novel that falls within the young adult fantasy genre. The book is set in a magical school where students are trained to harness their powers, but not just any powers, these are abilities tied to their darker, more villainous nature. The story follows Kiara, our FMC who is recruited as the King’s assassin. She is determined to infiltrate the academy & kill those who played a hand in the murder of her parents. She is hell bent on killing Prince Lucian (MMC) in order to end the royal bloodline. However, she gets more than she bargains for as there’s an undeniable chemistry between them both. Kiara must navigate the treacherous halls of the academy, facing challenges that test their morality, loyalty, and inner strength. One of the strongest elements of Academy of Villains is its world-building. Ever King does an excellent job creating a mysterious and complex world where power, ambition, and survival are paramount. The setting is rich with intrigue, and the academy itself is filled with secrets, making it a compelling environment for readers who enjoy intricate plots and a sense of danger lurking around every corner.However, the pacing can feel uneven at times. Some readers might find the first half of the book slow as the author sets up the world and characters. The action picks up considerably later on, and when it does, it’s filled with twists and turns that keep the reader engaged.Overall, Academy of Villains is a solid read for fans of dark fantasy and YA fiction. It offers a unique take on the academy trope, blending elements of magic, morality, and intrigue.
7070151416	The Academy of Villains is the first book in a new series inspired by the Greek mythology love story of Nyx and Erebus. The story introduces Kiara, one of the Nameless—an elite group of assassins. Kiara is hired to kill the Crown Prince, who is currently attending an Academy to learn magic as a Shadowmage. After infiltrating the Academy, Kiara is caught by the prince himself.Unbeknownst to Kiara, every new student at the Academy undergoes a ritual to unlock and announce their magical abilities. She’s forced into the ritual and, to her shock, is revealed to be a Starmage—the only one of her kind. Kiara grew up believing she was human, so she struggles tremendously with coming to terms with the fact that she now possesses magical abilities. Now, Kiara must remain at the Academy to learn how to control her magic while still completing her mission to assassinate the prince.This book follows a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers trope, with Kiara initially wanting to kill Prince Lucian to break the curse that has been attached to his royal family. As the story progresses, the two of them reluctantly join forces when the Oracle reveals that their cooperation is the key to breaking the curse.Though this is a standalone novel, it is part of a larger series, and while Kiara and Lucian’s story reaches a satisfying conclusion, the broader narrative is just beginning. I particularly enjoyed how the book incorporates elements of Greek mythology, with several mythological figures making appearances throughout the story.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am eagerly anticipating the next one in the series.
7571763990	Academy of Villains: Nyx & Erebus by Ever King is a dark academia romantasy read. Each book in the series follows a different couple inspired by Greek mythology. Told in dual points of view from Kiara and Lucian Academy of Villains is incredibly easy to read, and packed with magic, romance and high-stakes trials. The revised and expanded edition (June 2025) includes: 8 new chapters, an epilogue and expanded world lore. This book is for someone who loved Harry Potter and Throne of Glass but are ready for something more adult. This book takes place in a kingdom where magic is slowly disappearing. A evil king expands his territory, gaining more power and destroying everything in his path. He then collects orphaned children, who have no magic and train them as assassins to be used in his army. Those that do have magic are sent to the academy to serve as mages under the king. Kiara, once an assassin for the king, Infiltrates the magic academy so she can slay the prince and end the royal bloodline. But she unexpectedly discovers she too has magic. As students begin to vanish, Kiara's quest for vengeance turns into a battle for survival. Will she kill the prince she came here to kill or will she save the world with him?I don't read a lot of Romantasy but do enjoy the lore behind Greek Mythology. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to read and how quickly i got into it. Huge thank you to Ever King for partnering with NetGalley. I received an advanced reader copy of this book in exchange for my honest and review.
6992167792	I am a die-hard admirer of the fantasy genre, from YA to romantasy to high fantasy. If you mention spells, magical creatures, adventure, etc., I'm all in, especially if it includes references to Greek or Norse myths, which is exactly what happened with Academy of Villains. The short version is Academy of Villains is kind of like Hogwarts meets Gossip Girl meets Greek Mythology retelling. In this magical, adventure and battle-filled novel, we follow Kiara, an assassin sent to kill the Prince, and Lucian, a powerful prince with dark secrets studying at the Academy of Magic. This is a story based off the Greek myth of Nyx and Erebus, and while some elements are very clearly based on the original mythology, there are some creative twists and turns throughout the novel that kept me completely engaged in the story, and in love with the characters. Although the age range here is YA/new adult with low spice, the depth of emotion and range of development is amazing in a shorter novel. Noteable tropes and themese include MMC is a shadow daddy, "Who did this to you?" "Touch her and x," trials, only one bed, forced proximity, enemies to lovers, fated mates, and MMC would burn the world down for her. There were many highlighted quotes from this book for me, but one really summarizes the key elements of all the characters: "We're starlight and shadow. Together, we're unstoppable" If you're interested in fantasy with trials and battle, healing from trauma, finding yourself, romance, and Greek mythology themes, this is a wonderful read!
7168846144	This book was so so good!! I am ready for book 2 now! This book gives you everything you want in the fast-paced magical world. From the first page I was hooked :). I really loved the dynamic of the friendships, the secrets, the magnetic pull between the characters & the academic setting. Academy of Villains gives you strong Harry Potter vibes mixed with dark academia setting, except the students really are trying to kill each other and not only are there houses but secret societies. Aaanndddd enemies to lovers, missing students, deadly trials, elemental magic, cursed kingdom, star & shadow magic, heartbonds, and so so much more. It was every trope I loved wrapped into a book!Thank you to Netgalley and the author for providing me with an ARC copy
7228717440	2.5 starsThanks to NetGalley and the Editor. I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewI enjoyed this book but it is, by no means, a good book. There is a ton of potential in there, there are some good things (that are really good, too) but on the whole, this book is just bad. You have to suspend your disbelief, and then suspend it again, and again, and again. And it seems like it is out of laziness, because a lot of the issues could have been resolved pretty easily.This book is also pretty similar to Zodiac Academy, minus the bullies. Mind me, if we speak about personal enjoyment, I enjoyed this one way more than the other series, but if we speak about things well done, well, the other series wins without questions.I will try with a bullet list, because it seems a tad more easy to explain things:1)At the beginning of the book the author says “There are no heroes in this story” and when we meet the MCs for the first time, this seems to stand true: she is an assassin who is there to kill the prince, he is a prince with his friends, and the group seems full of badass people who are up to no good. (again, if you have read Zodiac Academy, the male characters are really similar). But as the story progresses, we lose the “we are all bad” aura, and since the characters find themselves involved in a quest (let’s call it that) to save the kingdom and the magic against the bad king well… they are heroes. They may not be the “knight in shining armor” kind of hero, but still, they are the good guys, no questions.So why? It’s not just bad that the first thing we read is a lie, but the change in tone has no reason to it. Why do you start one way and then do such a radical change?2)There are so many plot holes in there that it is like trying to navigate the story walking on Swiss cheese. I don’t really want to make spoilers, but I will just name one or two. Kiara is an assassin who is recruited to kill the prince at the Academy. This Academy is a magical school where all the young mages are sent, it is a highly protected place (even royalty attend it and all the rich scions of the biggest families of the kingdom), it has wards everywhere and they are the strongest you can imagine. Evidently, the wards do not stop assassins, only magic. Why? How do they work? It wasn’t possible to create wards against people who were not supposed to be there? They have all the magic of the world and… assassins just walk past them like that? Sure, they have to evade the patrols but still, it doesn’t seem like hard work infiltrating this place!And then Kiara fails in her first attempt and she finds herself in the sorting ceremony, with no easy way out she takes part in that and… oh wow, she has magic! So she now is a student of the Academy. Not only that, but she is the special one, the one with the kind of magic nobody else has (obviously) and everybody goes along with that. Don’t they have a list of the people who were supposed to start the year there? A number of expected people? Something? Sure, at one point the headmaster figured out that there was something strange here, but not right away, like some weeks after she was enrolled. How is that possible??3)We are told a lot of things. We don’t see them. Like, this academy should be something really harsh, where only the fittest survive (think like Fourth Wing kind of place) but all we get is some sentences overheard here and there like “Ehy, did you hear that once this professor let the students be eaten by the bests??” “Sure, but the headmaster told to keep an eye on things because it was bad for public relations” or something like that. (These are not direct quotes, but the kind of dialogues our MC overheard are like that). And there are a lot of elements that are inserted in the story that aren’t really developed or explained.4)The sheer waste of potential. We have some intriguing characters, all the prince’s friends sound pretty amazing in their own right, and they are not the only ones, there are a couple of students we met who are intriguing as heck. The point is, if without showing us a lot of them around, the author manages to create something so interesting, how great things would have been if they received their share of attention? And we have a magical school with some really cool lessons! But we just see them the bare minimum and then… that’s it. It would have been great to explore that world and that school!It is just that we have so many plot holes and so many things that don’t really work if you stop and think about them. And this is what makes a book a bad one. There are no excuses. That said, I have to admit that I enjoyed it. Because, well, first and foremost, I was in the right mood for it and this helped a lot. But there are good things in there, mind me. The writing is compelling, and the world the author creates is beautiful. There is such beauty between these pages! And I think that this is also what made things so bad: the author obviously is good at creating worlds and magic and characters, so why the plot is just a big hole with something around it??My rating is 2.5 stars, but I round it up at 3 because I still enjoyed it, I was pretty mad from time to time, but I wasn’t tempted to DNF because it was compelling and I was having fun, somehow.
7802169818	Academy of Villains by Ever King is a dark academia romantasy that absolutely consumed me from the first page. If you love stories with magic, danger, morally grey characters, and a romance that burns slow but deep, this book needs to be on your radar.The story follows Kiara, a nameless assassin trained to kill the cursed prince and end the royal bloodline. Her infiltration of the academy is supposed to be her final mission—but everything changes when she discovers she has magic of her own. Not just any magic, but a power thought to be long extinct. Suddenly, Kiara finds herself tangled in a web of secrets, secret societies, and trials that test not just her strength but her heart.Enter Lucien, the shadow-wielding prince she’s meant to kill. He’s mysterious, dangerous, and all-consuming in the best way. Their relationship is the ultimate enemies-to-lovers slow burn—filled with tension, push-and-pull banter, and a connection that feels fated. Watching their dynamic grow was one of my favorite parts of the story.The world-building is phenomenal—Greek mythology influences, dark academia vibes, secret societies, hidden powers, and a magic system that feels fresh and unique. I loved how books and grimoires are tied into the magic itself. Add in side characters (the Raven boys especially!) who are just as intriguing as the leads, and it’s clear this series has so much more to give.This book is mysterious, atmospheric, and addictive. It’s perfect for fans of Zodiac Academy, Throne of Glass, Harry Potter (Slytherin coded) or anyone who loves morally complex characters, magical academies, and stories that feel equal parts romantic and soul-shattering.I’m officially obsessed with this world and cannot wait for the next installment. Ever King has delivered a dark, romantic, and thrilling ride that will keep you up at night flipping pages.Thank you NetGalley and the author Ever Kjng for the eARC in exchange for my honest review.
7822727122	5⭐ | .5🌶️ As a devoted romantasy reader, I love nothing more than diving into new worlds and fresh magic systems—and this first installment in the Academy of Villains series by Ever King exceeded all expectations. The world-building is lush and vivid, the magic system complex and unique, and the cast of characters wonderfully diverse.A mythological retelling of Nyx and Erebus, the story follows Kiara and Lucian as they fight not only for themselves but for the fate of their kingdom. While some fantasy retellings can feel predictable or hokey, King weaves Greek mythology in both sweeping and subtle ways, creating a tale that pulled me in and refused to let go.Think dark academia with Harry Potter vibes—only she’s an assassin sent to kill him, and fate has other plans.✨ Expect:💫Upper YA romantasy🖤Dark academia🏛️Mythological retelling❤️‍🔥Enemies to lovers🗝️Secret societies♾️Fated 🖤Protective Shadow Daddy / 👑Prince of Darkness🌊🔥Elemental magic🌪️🌱🗡️Trials🛏️One bed🔥Slow burn closed-door spice🌶️Massive thanks to Ever King for this read—I’m diving straight into book 2 with book 3 not far behind!And if you haven’t checked out the Academy of Villains website yet, you’re truly missing out!

7824524165	I was sucked into this works immediately. The dark academia, enemies to lovers, morally gray characters, deadly trails, this books has it all. If you know me by now, you know I love a good villain. And the MMC is delicious and the FMC is stubborn (which I love). The slow burn with torturous. Also, if you enjoy a good book with very little spice, this book is for you. I very much enjoyed this book and can’t wait for book 2.
7797999492	First, I want to thank the author the arc! This is my first one ever!Wow!! This book had a chokehold on me by chapter 2. This dark academia was exactly what I needed to cure my Zodiac Academy hangover. Elemental magic, mages, grimoires, & a shadow daddy MMC??? Sign me upppp ✨ it’s giving Throne of Glass & Powerless with our assassin/magic-less FMC, she was sent to kill the prince but fate has different plans! Literally this book was the perfect combination of every trope I love. There was no spice but lots of yearning which I loved. The only thing that stuck out to me was some repetition of words/phrases/sentences. But other than that I absolutely loved this book & can’t wait to read the rest!!!
7763945286	This was such a fun read for me! Dark academia at its finest, with some trials and danger to spice things up. This enemies to lovers was so sweet, and I loved the dynamic between Lucian and Kiara. This was one of the most well executed “He falls First” I’ve ever read, and the way that Lucian is with Kiara just made me swoon. The magic system was unique and so well done, it made the magic duels even more compelling. I ate this up in a DAY and i am so excited that book two is also out because I can’t wait to dive in!
7121320530	First of all, thanks for the ARC; it was a pleasure to read this book! Academy of Villains is a fantasy book about a girl who's been trained all her life to be a Nameless assassin. One day, she is given an assignment: to kill the crown prince of Ithaka and break adark curse.But it turns out that she must work with him to succeed, and only with his help can she free the kingdom. Can they overcome their initial antipathy? Will they mean more to each other than simple partners? I was so curious about this book! I adore greek mythology, so it was obvious to me that I HAD TO read Academy of Villains . I had high hopes for it. Fortunately, I was not disappointed. The plot was a bit clichéd, but also action-packed with plenty of twists and turns! The writing style was enjoyable and easy to read, so I finished it quickly. My biggest problem was with the main characters and their romance. Lucian was way too overprotective .For me he was kinda annoying with this behavior. I know he was so in love with Kiara and wanted to protect her at all costs, but she's been a killer her whole life, and she can defend herself. And that brings me to Kiara. I expected her to be more stubborn, and I thought she would persistently stick to her opinion. She changed her mind from one moment to another, which was a bit disappointing. And now I'm talking about her feelings for Lucian. One chapter, she despised him, and in the next, she made out with him. I would have liked it better if their relationship and how their feelings for each other changed had been more fully developed. So, for me, their love was not as grandiose. On the other hand, I LOVED the side characters! They were diverse, funny, and interesting. The whole concept of the Raven Society was so exciting. It would have been great to learn more about it. My top three characters were definitely Octavia, Tobias, and Bastian, so I'm really looking forward to reading more about them.In a nutshell, I liked Academy of Villains , and I can't wait to the read sequel!If you love greek mythology, enemies to lovers, and dark-light dynamics, and are a fan of Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and A Curse So Dark and Lonely, then I recommend Academy of Villains !
6992052615	Firstly thank you Ever King for allowing me to be an ARC reader for your book!! When I found out about this book I was intrigued by the synopsis. I’ve been a fan of Greek retellings since I read Percy Jackson and love when I can find some that pique my interest. So when I read the blurb it struck me as Greek mythology meets Harry Potter and how could I pass that up? So if you liked either of those or neither and just want a Greek retelling of Nyx and Erebus. Also full disclosure I’m wasn’t super familiar with their story before so I didn’t know what was going to happen!!Now onto the characters!! The FMC, Kiara, is a girl who is strong willed and stubborn and wears her stubbornness as a mask to hide how she’s really feeling. And her stubbornness clashes with Lucian’s, the MMCs, own stubbornness in a beautiful display of wills that left me wanting more tension and on the edge of my seat. Lucian, the MMC, is a prince and have I mentioned he wields shadows? No? Well now you know and who doesn’t love a guy who can wield shadows? He, as I stated before, is also stubborn and he loves to ruffle Kiara’s feathers so to speak by poking and making comments just to get a reaction out of her. He also has a group of friends called The Raven Society made up of 6 other guys who all are connected to him though their families and ties to court. And they are basically a band of brothers. Who doesn’t love a good brotherly relationship?? Because it’s basically my weakness. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can’t wait for more from this world. And I can’t wait for more from the other guys and to see what their stories are going to be!! So if you’re looking for books that are Greek Retellings and have enemies to lovers, assassin FMCs, only one bed and a Dark shadow prince then look no further than Academy of Villains!!CW: Mild swearing, passionate kisses, fade to black with brief morning after scene, violence in magic fights and sword fights
7042759332	Well, where do I start ? Dark yet sunshine MMC and grumpy yet very emotional FMC ? - beautiful 😍 The magical family bound curce bringing the devastation to the land and its people ? Heartbreaking but relatable to one of the favourite tropes in magical worlds . Magical academy, discovery of yourself throgth your powers? Perfect representation on how you can find your true self in the most unpredictable situations. Plus, slowburn romance and trials is one of the best tropes out there 😍 Love the book , exited for the second one .
7015626571	If you say Greek Mythology you're basically yelling my name. I've been reading those myths ever since I was twelve and it's an old love that never disappears completely. So, when I saw this book on Netgalley I had to request a copy and luckily the author granted me one. I even got a message on my instagram to tell me that I was approved. I was really excited about reading this book and therefore fit it in as soon as I could.What I absolutely loved about this book was the magic. Although we haven't seen everything yet, the author is luckily not boring us with loads of info dumps, I like the idea of a grimoire appearing when you need it and spells being shown when you need them. I also loved the whole idea of star mages being eradicated for their unique powers and seeing what happened to the world when this magic was eventually brought back.For me the amount of Greek Mythology could have been a little more. I understand that this is a retelling and the plot does reflect this tale quite nicely, but the world could have felt a little more Greek. Maybe the descriptions just didn't work for me. Maybe I just wanted some more familiar sights and elements. In a way the author built a more original fantasy world, while I was somehow hoping for a more classical world.However, the characters and their journey absolutely made up for that. I have to admit that the part where the characters actively hate each other doesn't last very long. I therefore wouldn't really call this a haters to lovers. The author did find a way though to build up tension between the characters without giving us too much before the characters are ready for it. I'm also really excited that the next book will star another couple. The waiting for them to fall in love is, after all, the best part!
7022533744	This is a dark academia fantasy romance perfect for fans of Harry Potter and Throne of Glass. Each book of the series is inspired by a Greek mythology love story, this one is a retelling of Nyx and Erebus. The book is fast paced and probably has one of the coolest first lines ever. We start right at the thick of things as Kiara, one of the Nameless assassins, plots to kill the prince, a shadow mage, to end the curse. Her whole life she has hated the mages and magic, blaming them for the loss of her family. However as she infiltrates the Magic Academy looking for Prince Lucian, she discovers one terrible thing that could change everything… she has magic. 😱Not only does Kiara discover she’s a mage, she’s a starmage, a line long thought to be extinct. I’m obsessed with the magic system, the duels, the magical creatures, the academy, it gives me total Harry Potter vibes! I’m a total sucker for the “I came to 💀 you but fell in love” trope! It’s told in dual POV so we can see into the head of Prince Lucian himself, who’s fascination with Kiara consumes him. One thing is that I felt like Kiara was not such a good assassin 😅 she is often caught off guard & startled by someone. The romance is slow burn, both of them are drawn to each other but highly suspicious of one another. The pacing is action packed and I found myself curious to learn everything about this magical academy, it’s hidden societies and Kiara’s background. What you can expect:🗡️enemies to lovers🗡️villain gets the girl🗡️greek mythology retelling🗡️magic academia🗡️secret societies🗡️cursed kingdom🗡️I came to 💀 you but fell in love🗡️shadow daddy
7433568934	This was phenomenal! Definitely exceeded my expectations. Greek Mythology meets Harry Potter and The MummySpoiler free summary:A woman with no name is sent to kill the King's son but by whom and why? The FMC ends up getting put into the sorting ceremony where it is revealed to everyone including her that she is one of the most powerful mages. The Prince tries to push feelings away and put on a tough face but they are fated. Now they must figure out how to not only how to stay safe from people and forces outside the school but each other as well. Vibes:Some of the scenes in here are actually pretty funny. Her first magic fight I reread a couple of times because it was so good. The characters in this book are so different from each other it's insane. Every single person has a completely different identity. I do wish there was more of the magical aspect in this. The puzzles were great in this, you were figuring it out with them. However, it would be great to see more classes/magically challenges.I do like how forward the MMC is. It cuts a lot of corners and unnecessary fluff. It was also great to have both characters evolving without continuous repetition of the same drama over and over again.

7261593904	Thank you to Netgalley and Ever King for the ARC!This book was very entertaining! I really liked the magic system and the physical manifestations of the magic in this book. In my mind I almost imagined a pixie dust sort of quality to it. I could definitely see a harry potter-esque inspiration with a bit of the book, specifically towards the beginning. However, that completely went away as the book moved on and definitely became its own story. The grimoires and the role it played in the system was a very nice touch I think and really enjoyed that aspect. My favorite part of the book however, were the fighting scenes. I think they were so well done and never confused or lost me like some books do. The last half of the book really picked up speed and hooked me in, I can't wait to see what happens next! :)3.5 rounded up:)
7789645833	i’m a sucker for a dark academia + magic academy + enemies to lovers + greek mythology retelling, so this book did NOT disappoint for me in that aspect !!the setting of Ithaca, the academy, and the trials were all written so well and made me feel as if i was there, which is so important to me (i love descriptive text sooo much, and King really hits the nail on the head with it). and Kiara and Lucien ?? the slow burn is reallllll. and not to mention they are enemies to lovers AND fated mates ??? that sold it for me for sure. my only issues with the book were that sometimes i got a little lost by a handful of plot holes or how sometimes the actions didn’t flow as well as i excepted. overall, a fantastic book with high stakes and some light spice. super excited to continue the series !!
7538059895	This book was really good. The academy gave me Harry Potter/Hogwarts vives. I Loved the magic system and the world building.The two main characters were great and I really liked this story.Looking forward for the 2nd book.
7056564616	Dark academia, fantasy romance, and a story inspired by a Greek mythology love story. Academy of Villains has all of the elements that get my attention fast, and once I started, I was hooked! Academy of Villains follows Kiara, one of the assassins known as the Nameless, and Lucian Darkwing, Crown Prince of Ithaka. Kiara is assigned to unalive Lucian and break the curse on the kingdom. To do so, she sneaks into the Academy of Magic, but she winds up getting lumped in with the new students participating in the ceremony for the new arrivals and to her shock, she discovers that she has magic. Not only that, but she’s a Starmage, a type of mage that was brought to extinction. Oh and the Prince is a Shadowmage. The aesthetic is perfection!The story and characters were fantastic, with a very strong start and exciting ending. I especially loved the dark academia setting with secret societies, among which is the Raven Society, formed by the prince and his friends, all very powerful, very clever and even dangerous mages. If the MMCs of the next books—which are all going to be inspired by a different Greek mythology love story—are the boys from the Raven Society, then all the romances are going to be AMAZING. There isn’t a single one I’m not curious about. The Academy comes with its risks, between the classes that could prove fatal and the power plays between students or the different societies. This was the part of the book I was most intrigued by and would have loved to see even more!Here are some tropes and elements:❤️‍🔥 enemies to lovers🖤 villain gets the girl🏛️ greek mythology retelling🏰 magic academia🕯️ secret societies🏰 cursed kingdom⚔️ warrior brotherhoodThank you to the author for gifting me a copy. Opinions are my own.
6861972733	I am a little late but I eventually made it! First, thank you, Ever King, for the ACR copy.This book was an awesome start to a series! I had to use my 'read out loud' feature for this book because my phone's screen got broken. It was so well written that I was able to follow along with the story just fine even with it being read out loud.This book is everything I love about enemies to lovers. Slow burn, good plot, full interesting character roster, and great world building. Our main female lead is an assigned assassin sent out to kill the Prince. She discovers she is a rare type of mage that was long thought to be irradiated from existence long ago. This is also news to everyone including herself. Our prince is a shadow mage, which is also rather rare, who has spent his whole life learning to control his magic.When these characters begin interacting, we discover hidden secrets about their magic. Spells and secrets thought lost to the world. One of these secrets pretty much becomes the plot of book one. The way the main characters are written, we slowly catch on to bits and pieces and their puzzles. This is only book one. It doesn't necessarily leave off on a cliff hanger but it does not answer everything, nor is the story wrapped up.Five stars for being well written enough to be adapted to 'read out loud' and for being an entertaining start to a series. Kept my interest all the way though.
6992380738	This novel presents a captivating blend of magic, intrigue, and romance, set within a school that exudes a dark, Slytherin-like ambiance. The dynamic between the Nameless assassin, Kiara, and the crown prince, Lucian, unfolds as a compelling enemies-to-lovers trope, filled with tension and gradual emotional evolution. Their combined magic resurrects the ancient concept of soul mate bonds, or heartstrings, injecting delightful chaos and complexity into their world. The slow-burning romance is tastefully spicy, offering just the right amount of heat to appeal to both young adult and adult readers. While Lucian's repetitive musings might feel redundant at times, they underscore his immediate captivation by Kiara, whose own journey to love is more measured and introspective. The novel shines in its depiction of friendships, enriching the narrative with depth and warmth. The satisfying conclusion addresses key plot points while cleverly setting the stage for future installments, leaving readers eager to explore the impact of heartstrings on the broader cast of characters. This story offers a perfect blend of romance, magic, and character development, making it a must-read for fans of fantasy and romance alike.
7102852602	This book was a masterpiece. It got it me out of a several-months-long reading slump, and I’ve finished it in under a day. I was genuinely impressed by this, so I’m glad to share my opinion on yet another Romantasy recommendation.First of all, I’d like to mention the world building. You know I love criticizing it. Well, not in this case. It had the perfect amount of all the needed information, it didn’t make me confused at any point, and I was immersed in the idea from the first pages. Talking about the first pages, I have to mention that I just knew I’d love the book from the first line - it was that good and promising.But it doesn’t stop here. The characters and their relationships were the absolute best of the story. They were smart, funny, complex. In other words, everything a girl might expect from a good book. I’m in complete awe of the FMC, because now I know of another amazing knife wife that I can’t stop comparing with Inej and Jude. Oh, and how good was the MMC! Shadow guys always hit different, especially the ones so nice and sincere, no matter the power they wield.As a huge fan of enemies to lovers, I definitely recommend this novel, and I can’t wait for part 2!
7668078301	Set in the kingdom of Ithaka, a place where magic is fading, the evil king takes orphaned children and trains them to be assassins in his army. 🗡⚔️The FMC, Kiara, is one of the assassins for the king, and she accidentally discovers that she has magical abilities. She is forced into the new world of magic that she must now adapt to. ✨️🔮Kiara joins the Magical Academy, which has her discovering secrets, unraveling mysteries, and forging friendships along the way. It has her questioning her morals, as she’s forced to adapt to a world that she was initially hell-bent against. As Kiara explores the world of magic, we get to explore it with her. 🗺🎩I LOVE the found family trope, and it's really heartwarming to see it throughout the story. There's the really tight-knit group of boys in the secret society who look out for each other, and Kiara, who creates new friends at the Academy. 🫶🏼♥️All in all, it's incredibly captivating and pulls you in for a rollercoaster of emotions!
7474918776	I was instantly drawn in upon reading the book's blurb. The blend of enemies-to-lovers, magic academy, and Greek Mythology was compelling. The reimagining of Greek Mythology was skillfully integrated into the narrative. The magic academy evoked Hogwarts, with its Slytherin house ambiance. The magic system was distinctive and engaging. Mages are assigned a grimoire based on their elemental magic, which starts blank and displays spells to the user as needed, while remaining blank to others.Although the enemies-to-lovers aspect did not align with my expectations, as I prefer the gradual development of love and hate, I still found it enjoyable. The concept was captivating, and I highly recommend it to fans of dark academia, magic, trials, fated mates, and dual POV. This is a series I plan on devouring! ⚔️
6928692060	✨️My thoughts✨️Greek mythology with Harry Potter-ish vibes, sign me up!! I absolutely enjoy reading greek mythology, and this one definitely didn't disappoint. This was a very fast-paced and fun read for me. I personally enjoyed the magic, prophecy, the nameless assassins, and adventure. But then again, the heartstrings were such a cool concept of being bonded by fate. ✨️favorite qoute✨️"A promise that I’ll always be there, that you’ll never be alone again.”✨️Tropes✨️❄️Cursed prince and assassin❄️Enemies to lovers❄️Magic academy ❄️Secret societies ❄️Powerful FMCs
7069693968	If you love Zodiac Academy without the spice and Harry Potter then this book is for you.. I loved the way that the characters grow throughout the book and realise that together they're stronger.. doing what they must to save the kingdom from the Curse and finding themselves along the way.. the storyline and the trials were brilliant and I really enjoyed the flow throughout.. I can't wait to find out what comes next..
6927015831	I absolutely loved this book!!! This is definitely worth reading and I can’t wait for the next one!
7978510053	4.25 stars ★★★☆☆I also posted my review on my blog ✿ Academy of Villains - Nyx & Erebus is a fantasy dark academia following Kiara who has infiltrated the Academy of Magic in order to kill the heir to the crown. Before she can fulfil her mission, she stumbles upon the enrolment process, accidentally undertaking the selection and discovering she has magic. Academy of Villains - Nyx & Erebus is a fast paced YA romantasy that really surprised me. I knew I would like this but I didn’t expect to inhale the entire story in such a short amount of time. I didn’t want to put it down. This book actually had characters going to classes, working on their magic abilities and exploring the institution. The worldbuilding of the academy was immersive and really delivered the dark academia vibes, with secret societies and hidden passages. Rival secret societies, villain gets the girl, prophecies, deadly trials and morally grey characters. All these tropes were beautifully integrated into the story, and kept me engaged the entire time. Lucian falling first, and hard for the girl trying to kill him was glorious and the tension it produced was delicious.Unfortunately, the ending wasn't as strong as the rest of the book. The further the characters travel away from the academy, the weaker the story gets. The deadly trials were interesting, and highlighted character growth, but the fact that love is the answer felt disappointing. The tension between the characters was so good, but I wish Kiara accepted their fated bond without declarations of love.One thing that I noted was that representation within the group was a little disappointing. As a Black reader, it was easy to notice that there was only one person of colour between the 7 guys and 4 girls. I hope I am wrong and that one or two of the boys are BIPOC. I am excited for the rest of the series (especially Olivia and Tobias!!) Would I recommend this book??

7862960473	Academy of Villains is the first book in a series where each book follows a different couple inspired by Greek mythology. I've been eyeing this book for quite a while and I'm so happy I finally got to read it!This series is my newest obsession!A dark academia romantasy, with morally complex characters and a delicious slowburn. 🫠✨"What are the chances the man I came to k*ll would be the one to catch me?"✨The story was fast paced and the plot flowed effortlessly. The author created a very interesting world with a lot of secrets and political intrigue. The magic system was complex but easy to understand. ✨"I take a deep breath, the image of her standing there, dagger glinting in the moonlight, flashing before my eyes. That she would even dare to make an attempt to my life sends a thrill racing through me."✨I instantly liked Kiara. She was already strong and badass before she even came to her magical powers. And I love how having powers didn't change her personality.✨"She's dangerous. And beautiful. Stunningly so, but it's the kind of beauty that you'd expect from a colorful but poisonous flower."✨Lucian was such an intriguing character. A shadow daddy prince who seemed to care for no one. But he lived a sheltered life, despite being a strong magic weilder, and it was bittersweet to see how he finally started to explore more of his kingdom.✨"I want her to look at ne differently. To see me. To want me. To need me. And I will make her look at me that way."✨The romance between these two was at the center of the story. And the slow burn was BURNING! 🔥 Both couldn't deny the attraction and pull towards the other but it took them very long to finally admit it. ✨"Do you think I'm weak?""No," I say instantly, my voice firm. "But you're worth protecting."✨✨"Kissing Lucian is like kissing the night sky istlef - dark and endless, pulling me in with the gravity of a thousand stars."✨✨"If his love is a curse, I'll wear it like a crown."✨I can't wait to read the next book! I'm very excited to learn more about Bastian. A big thank you to the author Ever King for gifting me a review copy of her book to read and review. 💚
7248309106	Before I started reading this story I saw a couple of reviews that referenced Harry Potter and Throne of Glass when describing this book and I can't lie that I was a little nervous going in. However I was hooked from the very first chapter! I love assassins, a dark academia setting and an interesting magic system which Academy of Villains does not lack. I found the writing to be descriptive and engaging, you can really picture the locations and different settings as you are reading which makes for an immersive experience. The atmosphere was one of my favourite things about this story and it continued throughout the whole book. Not only do you get a magic school but also secret societys which make the story all the more intriguing. The romance is a slow burn and it definitely feels like it but the chemistry between the two main characters is pretty much immediate - the tension and banter they had on the page was top tier!Thank you to netgalley and the author for a copy of this book.
7002466282	*Review copy provided via NetGalley in exchange of an honest review*This book started out really strong and I had high hopes, but at some point it went flat and I started to lose interest.Kiara is one of the Nameless, aka the King’s Assassins. Lucien (AKA the Prince) is away at school for mages and while Kiara is there to kill him, she’s mistaken as a student and “sorted” in a ceremony eerily similar to a very famous wizarding school ceremony. (IYKYK) While at school, discovers she’s actually a mage, the people she hates most in this world. She basically has to decide if she wants to give up her mission to kill the prince and study magic or continue with her original goal - kill the prince and get rid of magic forever. The end was just…boring. I guess I expected a lot more. I am hoping the series picks up more in the next book! Thank you to Ever King and NetGalley for allowing me to read and review.
7798582029	Thank you Ever King and NetGalley for this ARC. This was such a fun read. I loved the Greek mythology and magically aspects to it and loved the grimoires and how they were used. I thought it was very unique! I did struggle with the beginning of the book as it was a lot of internal monologue and there wasn’t a lot of connections happening with characters but once they started connecting and talking it became a lot more balanced, I also wished we were able to see more of the relationship between Lucian and Kiara form and grow it was quite quick due to the trials. I absolutely loved how headstrong Kiara was and that she didn’t need anyone’s help but she grew to learn that it’s okay to lean on others and to trust others, and I loved that Lucian knew how strong she is and even though he tried to protect her it wasn’t because he thought she was weak it was just out of care and overall didn’t try to stop her from being her badass self but instead supported her through the challenges. I will definitely be heading back to Ithaka with book 2!
7846696750	Academy of Villains was everything I needed in a romantasy. I adored Lucian and Kiara, and I seriously can’t wait to dive into the next book. I mean… celestial magic and a shadow daddy? (Yes, there’s both.)Basically, an assassin is sent to kill the prince… and the rest? You’ll just have to read and find out :D
7158406627	Review on netgalley!!Thank you so much for the ARC
6981549902	Academy of Villains by Ever King - ARC Review3.5⭐️ |1🌶️Academy of Villains is an immersive fantasy novel inspired by Greek mythology, following the story of Kiara, a strong, fearless female protagonist, and Lucian, a charismatic and intriguing male lead. Set in a world that combines elements of magical academies with mythological themes, the book takes readers on a thrilling journey where Kiara, alongside Lucian and other fascinating characters, navigates the challenges of an academy that trains the villains of the world. Drawing inspiration from the love story of Nyx and Erebus from Greek mythology, the book explores themes of power, destiny, and the blurred lines between good and evil.I’m going to be honest—Academy of Villains by Ever King wasn’t something I would have picked up on my own. As someone who typically gravitates toward romance, I was initially hesitant to dive into a fantasy story. However, when the author offered to send me the book, mentioning that it was inspired by Greek mythology, specifically the love story of Nyx and Erebus, I was intrigued enough to give it a shot. And I am so glad I did!The best way I can describe Academy of Villains is a mix between Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, with a darker edge and deeper mythological roots. From the very first page, I was hooked. The pacing is fantastic, and for someone who isn’t a regular fantasy reader, I found the world-building and plot progression easy to follow. Ever King has an incredible way of making complex fantasy elements feel accessible while still delivering a rich, detailed experience.One of the things I loved most about the book is how vividly it was written. The descriptive language brought the world to life in a way that made it easy to imagine every scene. I could almost see the magic, feel the tension, and experience the journey alongside the characters. The characters themselves are one of the main reasons this book stood out to me. Kiara, the female protagonist, is incredibly fierce, determined, and courageous. She’s the kind of character you can’t help but root for. She’s unapologetically strong-minded and will always do what’s right, even when the odds are stacked against her.Lucian, the male lead, is just as captivating. He brought a perfect balance of charm and mystery to the story. He had this effortless ability to make me giggle, but also this depth that made me invest in his character. Their chemistry was undeniable from the start, and I found myself loving their connection and how it developed throughout the book. As I primarily read romance novels, I did wish for a little more romance, but I went into this book knowing it is more of a fantasy read, so I still enjoyed it.I’m so glad I took the chance to read it, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, mythology, or simply an engaging story with great characters. Thank you to Ever King for offering me the opportunity to read your book—I can’t wait to see where the series goes next!
7055078208	He was the beast lurking in the shadows, and I was the prey who would fight back.For a debut author - this was an excellent first book!The first half really had me. The characters and their backstories are interesting, the magic system is very original and intriguing, what more does a girl want?For the trope fans:- enemies to lovers- knife to the throat (this scene was HOT)- fated mates (chef's kiss)- who did this to youuuu- chosen one (my guilty pleasure🥰)- secret society (my boy Kaspian >>)- original magic system!!There were some ANGSTY scenes thrown in there that I literally wiggled my feet at🤭 I love me a good 'losing control of powers' scene. I also just ADORE her powers, they're so awesome. And the grimoire was a very nice touch.But then it got kinda ruined by the second half? It really didn't feel as strong as the first part. The enemies to lovers started of well and then the trials came and she just.. liked him all of a sudden? Idk it felt sudden to me, but maybe it's because of the fated mates thing ig. The pacing also felt a bit off with the trials. And then the book was just suddenly over.Nonetheless, I had a wonderful time reading this book and will most certainly be looking forward to a part 2. Bc you can't just leave me hanging like that, I have QUESTIONS!!Thank you to NetGalley and the author for providing me a copy of this book.⭐️⭐️⭐️.🌟 3.75 stars!
7070876458	Book Review: Academy of Villains by Ever KingAcademy of Villains by Ever King is an exhilarating, fast-paced fantasy novel that will have readers hooked from the very first page. As the first book I’ve read in this series, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed by Ever King’s writing, and I can’t wait to dive deeper into the world they’ve created.The story follows Kiara, a skilled assassin who has been tasked with an impossible job: to kill the prince. However, things take an unexpected turn when Kiara discovers that she possesses magic—something she never knew she had. This revelation shifts the entire course of her mission, leading her down a path that intertwines with Prince Lucian, the very person she was supposed to eliminate. Together, they embark on a dangerous quest to defeat a dark and powerful force threatening their world.One of the standout elements of Academy of Villains is the incredible world-building. King has created a rich and immersive universe filled with magic, political intrigue, and fascinating characters. From the moment Kiara enters this world, readers are transported into a realm that feels both familiar and wholly unique. The atmosphere is dark and suspenseful, keeping the tension high and the pages turning. The balance between action, mystery, and character development is skillfully maintained throughout, making it a page-turner that’s difficult to put down.Kiara is a compelling protagonist—strong, resourceful, and flawed in ways that make her feel real and relatable. Her dynamic with Prince Lucian adds a layer of complexity to the story, with tension and chemistry that keeps readers eagerly anticipating what will happen next. The romance is slow-burn, but it’s the kind of connection that feels earned and organic, which adds emotional depth to the narrative.I also want to highlight the author’s ability to blend high-stakes action with moments of introspection. The quest to defeat the dark lord is thrilling, but it’s the inner growth of Kiara and Lucian that truly elevates the story. As they uncover secrets about their pasts and their powers, they are forced to confront their own beliefs and make tough choices that will shape their future.Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with an ARC of Academy of Villains. It was an absolute pleasure to read this book, and I look forward to the next installment in the series. If you’re a fan of fast-paced fantasy with a strong, complex heroine, an intriguing plot, and a richly developed world, this book is a must-read. Ever King has crafted a captivating start to what promises to be an unforgettable series.Rating: 5/5 stars
7554664917	I just finished Academy of Villains by Ever King, and I am absolutely empty now that I finished it—in the best way. This book delivered everything I crave in a fantasy: high stakes, rich worldbuilding, magnetic characters, and a magic system that felt both fresh and deeply immersive.Our fierce FMC, Kiara, is no ordinary protagonist. Stolen from her childhood and shaped into a lethal weapon by “The Nameless,” a covert assassin program, she is cold, calculated, and undeniably compelling. Her mission? Infiltrate the elite Academy of Magic, track down the cursed prince, and end his life to save a kingdom shrouded in darkness. But nothing is ever that simple. She must remember “without question, without fear.”Enter Lucien Darkwing—the cursed prince himself. And let me just say: he has firmly claimed a spot in my top five book boyfriends. For those who fell for Xaden Riorson, Lucien is going to steal your heart (and probably your soul). He’s a dark, dangerous, and devastatingly charming shadow-wielder, and yet still feels entirely his own. Every scene with him crackles with intensity.As the story unfolds, Kiara discovers she possesses a rare and long-lost magic—one that might be the key to breaking the curse strangling their realm. Together, she and Lucien must face ancient trials, unravel tangled secrets, and confront a kingdom corrupted from within. Their connection is electric, their mission nearly impossible—and I couldn’t tear myself away.The magic system in Academy of Villains was pure brilliance—so vivid it felt like I could grab a grimoire and start casting spells myself. This was a five-star read through and through. Huge thanks to Ever King for crafting such an immersive, unforgettable world. I’m already itching for the next installment!
