3468289094	oooh, goodreads choice awards finalist for best mystery & thriller 2021! WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET’S FIND OUT!i have put off writing this review since reading the ARC back in MARCH because i didn't want to poop on anyone else's pre-release anticipation with my less-than-glowing reaction, but now that it's been out for a bit, i'm gonna let my poop out, too. stand back.i didn't get around to reading The Silent Patient until The Great Lockdown of 2020, and it was just the twistyfun distraction i needed from the world, so when i heard that his follow-up was going to be a campus thriller involving seeeeecret societies, classical mythology, and a sinister professor, my The Secret History-loving self was SO EXCITED, and the marketing campaign leading up to its release kindled alla my dark delicious anticipation. and yet.it's just...look, i hate being that guy, but it's just not very good. i'm pretty reasonable about managing my expectations when it comes to summertime psych-suspense thrillery books; they don't gotta be art, they just need to hold my interest and maybe throw a surprise or two my way. escapist entertainment is fine, but i don't like being insulted, and that's what this felt like.QUICKPLOT: mariana is a psychotherapist specializing in group therapy who is still hard-grieving the drowning-death of her beloved husband the previous year. she reluctantly returns to the memory-saturated college campus where their love story began to console her niece/adopted daughter-figure zoe after her best friend tara is found murdered. zoe suspects one of the professors of killing tara, and, encouraged by her former mentor, mariana decides to stick around and do some amateur sleuthing, during which time more girls are murdered. meanwhile, mariana is being low-key stalked by one of her patients from back home, and she meets a younger man who claims to be psychic and is convinced they have a romantic future together, because visions. my first gripe was with the structure. each chapter is about three pages long, which speeds up the pace and prevents the reader from becoming fully immersed in the story—we're just skimmed along through the plot points at a pace seemingly designed to camouflage the fact that there's no development happening; that this is more like an outline of a mystery novel than one fully-realized.the immersion problem is made worse by the frequent insertions of psych-stuff; these clinical asides breaking up the flow:Accompanying the housekeeper on shopping trips to the crowded and frenetic market in the center of Athens always made Mariana nervous. And she was relieved, and a little surprised, to return home unscathed. Large groups continued to intimidate her as she grew older. At school, she found herself on the sidelines, feeling as if she din't fit in with her classmates. And this feeling of not fitting in was hard to shake. Years later, in therapy, she came to understand that the schoolyard was simply a macrocosm of the family unit: meaning her uneasiness was less about the here and now—less about the schoolyard itself, or the market in Athens, or any other group in which she might find herself—and more to do with the family in which she grew up, and the lonely house she grew up in.on the very next page:Mariana grew up with a keen awareness of [her mother's] loss. As a therapist, she knew a baby's first sense of self comes through its parents' gaze. We are born being watched—our parents' expressions, what we see reflected in the mirror of their eyes, determines how we see ourselves. Mariana had lost her mother's gaze—and her father, well, he found it hard to look at her directly.i have a problem with that inserted "well," voice-wise, but the bigger problem is the decision to develop a character thru psych 101 notes. it's...inelegant. i understand that she's a therapist and what she does is bound to inform who she is (which again opens up that whole can of worms re: voice), but these details just don't work in chapters this short; they're not well-integrated into the story, they distance the reader from the character and there's no opportunity to settle back in before we're off to the next chapter. in fact, a lot of this book feels like the author is shoehorning in details from his own personal cache of 'stuff he knows about,' without regard for their narrative utility: psychotherapy, the beauty of the greek islands, greek mythology, the greek language. these recurring motifs take up a lot of real estate at the expense of other story elements, like character development, and they don't do much to enhance the larger story. because here's what's not in his personal cache of 'stuff he knows about:' creating believable characters.NONE of the characters are believable, every interaction is fraught, written as though accompanied by a very intense and cheesy b-movie musical score, everyone all sticky with malice and foreboding. suspend all disbelief, ye who enter here. so. zoe believes professor edward fosca killed tara, claiming that they were having an affair and that, when tara threatened to expose their relationship, fosca threatened her right back and hours later, she turned up dead.edward fosca is a byronically handsome american professor specializing in greek tragedies (natch) who seems to only teach the prettiest girls on campus; several confident, intelligent girls known as the maidens who have formed a tight-knit little secret society based on the persephone myth, and whose education is frequently conducted by fosca in private sessions featuring drugs and alcohol and wild parties but it's not a harem at all, oh no, he's just the light these 20-year-old girlmoths collectively named after virginal ingenues gravitate towards and it's all perfectly normal academia. tara was one of the maidens, but neither fosca nor any of the other young women except zoe seem especially broken up over her death. to contrast grief-responses: mariana is clutching and weeping over her dead spouse's sneakers fourteen months after his death, but an inner-circle maiden dies and the next day these ladies are just fine and dandy, cool and snarky. now, you may well ask yourself why no one would give a little wait, what? about a female-student-collecting prof drinking behind closed doors with all these pretty little maidens, or find the optics of professor mcdreamy striding across campus trailed by an entourage of girls in flowy white dresses on their way to a memorial service...ill-advised? no objections at all, because on this campus, *shrug*, that's just how students learn. when mariana was matriculating, she developed a relationship with her (female) advisor that continues to the present-day, but began with the same kind of boundary-blurring: Most of the teaching...was done on a one-to-one basis, between fellow and student, usually taking place in the fellow's rooms. At any time after midday, or even earlier, at the discretion of the fellow concerned, alcohol was invariably served...providing an education in drinking as well as literature.It also meant that tutorials took on a more personal flavor, and lines between teacher and pupil became blurred—confidences were given, and intimacies exchanged.speaking of exchanged intimacies, (view spoiler)[fosca is eventually fired because he was, in fact, sleeping with ALL of the maidens. WHAT A COMPLETE SHOCK, SAID NO ONE. maybe shoulda looked into that before the bodies started dropping. (hide spoiler)]mariana may understand that sometimes teachers and students drink together in private rooms and that's a totally normal part of the education process, but she trusts zoe's instincts about fosca's guilt, and he's certainly not acting unshady. cue dialogue:"I can see you have cast me as the villain—a predator preying on my vulnerable students. Except now you're met these young ladies, you can see there's nothing vulnerable about them. Nothing untoward happens at these meetings—it's just a small study group, discussing poetry, enjoying wine and intellectual debate.""Except now one of those girls is dead."Professor Fosca frowned. There was an unmistakable flash of anger in his eyes. He stared at her. "Do you think you can see inside my soul?"Mariana looked away, embarrassed by the question. "No, of course not. I didn't mean—""Forget it." He took another drag of his cigarette, all anger apparently gone. "The word 'psychotherapist,' as you know, comes from the Greek 'psyche,', meaning 'soul,' and 'therapeia,' meaning 'healing.' Are you a healer of souls? Will you heal mine?""No. Only you can do that."Fosca dropped his cigarette onto the path. He ground it into the earth with his foot. "You're determined to dislike me. I don't know why."i am determined to dislike them both because of how poorly they are written. that dialogue—yeesh. it's contrived and melodramatic and just bad. "Do you think you can see inside my soul?" really, michaelides? and then the old tonal switcheroo from melodrama to etymological mansplaining her profession to her? you can practically see the red-pen arrow promising "authentic dialogue TK."mariana is why we can't have nice things in the 'strong female character' department. i get that she's raw and marinating in grief, borderline hysterical with nostalgia and (figurative) ghosts, but she's impossible to root for. she does not come across as the intelligent, educated woman we are assured she is. while she's able to spew chonks of textbook psych-evaluations about those around her, they come across as reflexive; knee-jerk assessments without any real insight into human behavior. she's in a perma-fog, she responds emotionally in every situation, she misreads every room. she's a poorly drawn caricature: the grieving widow/meddling sleuth that all the men fall for even though it wasn't until sebaaaaastian that she ever felt beautiful blah blah blah. anyway, the guy she thinks is a murderer invites her to dinner at his place and she accepts:Fosca smiled. "Good...My rooms, at eight? And one more thing—"Before she could stop him, he leaned forward—And he kissed her on the lips.It only lasted a second. By the time Mariana could react, he had already pulled back.Fosca turned and went through the open gate. Mariana heard him whistling as he walked away.She brushed away the kiss with her fist.How dare he?She felt as if she had been assaulted—attacked; and that he had won somehow, succeeded in wrong-footing, intimidating her.what on earth was that? that And one more thing— like he's a predatory columbo. it's a power move out of a gothic melodrama, complete with the wilting female victim, and whistling? really? that whole scene is so...silly. okay, that covers structure and characters, so i guess plot is next? mariana's involvement in this investigation beggars belief. she is asked by her former advisor to assist in the investigation because 1) she is a group therapist, and the school is like a group, and 2) she used to go to the school. neither of these are qualifications for murder-solving, an elderly professor has no authority to deputize her onto the case, and mariana has a conflict of interest cluttering up her tunnel-vision, but no matter—she agrees and begins conducting her own interviews with various parties, slipping into the deceased's room and pawing through her stuff, hiding in shadows and spying on students and tagging zoe in on her amateur sleuthery, against the protestations of the actual police, whose case she is most definitely compromising. in fact, on page 73 the chief inspector attached to the case tells her to keep out of the investigation, which warning comes before she's even begun her actual snooping. mariana's dubious contributions to the investigation are superfluous—the authorities have already called in a renowned forensic psychologist to consult—a man with whom mariana is acquainted, who light-flirts with her and allows her to sit in on his suspect interviews. because all of this is how things work. i suppose we're meant to see this ignoring-police-mandates stance as plucky? determined? but she stumbles over clues and evidence on her merrily misguided crusade without looping in the people who actually know what they're doing until you just wanna shake her. where i lost my mind was when mariana is led to the location of the murder weapon by a non-police person, and it doesn't even occur to her to object when they remove it from its hidey-hole. i know she's not a professional with a responsibility to preserve evidence, but oh we just allow people to grab murder weapons now, do we? mariana? COME ON, MARIANA!but the real issue i had was with the reveal of whodunnit and why. the motive is dumb, the whole unfurled scope of the murder plot even dumber; an overcomplicated rube goldberg machine built on interlocking assumptions, wishful predictions, and magical thinking from a wholly unqualified strategist. there are at least five things about it that MAKE NO SENSE and the whole thing left me spluttering with outrage. seriously, ____ (proper noun) killed ___(pronoun) ______ (all-caps noun, two words) even though the whole reason for the murder was moot? you don't countermand that plan and find a different way? and ____ (proper noun) didn't recognize ANYTHING from ____'s (proper noun) life in that ___ (noun)? presumably, before ____ (proper noun) went all ______ (disparaging slang), they'd ______ (verb, past tense) about their _____ (noun, plural)?? no?and ____ (proper noun) waited _____ (period of time) before deciding to get ____(adjective)? and ____(verb, past tense) _______ (proper noun) for (noun)? even though _____ (series of facts we are told at the beginning that contradict motive and some math that may or may not be accurate?????????????)and don't get me started on the psychic love-interest. "I have a gift for that sort of thing, you know—runs in my family—foresight, premonitions. I see things others do not."so, he's psychic enough to see the future when it involves cartoon bubble-hearts, but he doesn't see ____ (proper noun) ___ (gerund) on the ____ (noun) as he ____ (verb, present tense) by, either IRL or in a vision? a psychic character is silly enough, a psychic character with so many blind-spots is narratively purposeless. and THEN—there's a nice little The Silent Patient connection, but he ruins the moment by bashing the reader over the head with it a couple more times to make sure we noticed, lessening the effect of the shared world, and it left me with the same bad-taste reaction as the similarly-shaped ending of Split, which tie-in-reveal is the only cool thing in an otherwise terrible film. the idea of a group therapist investigating a man who has nurtured a little cultlike group around him is rich with possibility, and the juxtaposition between fosca's ladygroup with henry in mariana's therapy group was so promising: As soon as any group establishes itself, it always arouses envy and attack—and not just from forces on the outside, those excluded from the group, but also from dark and dangerous forces within the group itself. but the execution is so weak—subplots fizzle out, lackluster red herrings (henry-ings?) are dropped unexplored in order to deliver the most ridiculous explanation of all time with no regard for the tradition of fair play in mystery novels. i could do this all day—i haven't even touched upon the postcards, or the on-the-nose focus on revenge tragedies, but i've already gone on so long here that i'm running out of review-space, despite cutting out so many tirade-tangents i don't even know if what's left of the review makes sense anymore, and i've spent so much time rereading chunks of the book to make sure i'm not missing anything that makes the book make sense, and i'm just getting hot and cranky and i want this to be over. this book is getting a lot of positive reviews, and i'm happy for those readers who enjoyed it, but i can't help wondering if maybe the ARC-version i read went through extensive revisions before its final draft because what i read doesn't feel like the product of a three-years-writing-and-revising follow-up to a runaway-success debut novel. The Secret History? more like weak-ret history. *********************************got a postcard in the mail yesterday...directing me to a website with this message: and i cannot wait. three cheers for intriguing marketing strategies!!!come to my blog!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
3779148600	Where do I begin.... It may only be April, but put this down as the biggest letdown of the year for me. This simply did not work for me almost from the get-go and features so many problems that I'm shocked this is coming from the same author as The Silent Patient. While this will no doubt be a bestseller due to TSP's momentum and fandom, proceed with caution and severely tempered expectations if you're diving into this one. The premise of a secret society of Maidens was intriguing. The intersection between psychology and Greek mythology and tragedy is definitely alluring and could have been wickedly addicting and darkly entertaining, but alas, Michaelides took things in a different direction entirely. Given Michaelides' familiarity with the psychology and psychotherapy fields, I found his use of psychology and group therapy in this book incredibly troubling, bordering on disrespectful, and downright dangerous in its perpetuation of the myth that psychopaths are made in childhood. Specifically, that a lack of warmth, love, and validation combine to create those we see as monsters capable of brutal violence, often towards women. This is a point greatly discussed and contended within the psychology field and comes rife with assumptions and judgment, often toward female caregivers. And yet, while making that statement, our MC, Mariana, finds herself with moments of deep compassion and empathy for the murderer, even going so far as blaming the victim he murdered as "provoking" him and making excuses for this violence by characterizing it as the actions of "a terrified child inside [who just] lashed out; and reached for a knife." The characterization of the murder itself continues the dialogue that women are responsible for the behaviors of men and that men, when acting out in violence, are reacting to a provocation. As children, they cannot be held accountable. Instances like these make it very clear this is a male author attempting to write female characters and fundamentally lacking any insight into the truths and fears of women. It is glaringly apparent Michaelides struggled to truly understand women and how they think and behave; their fears and motivators, and relegated them to orbiting around men and their influence.Other aspects where psychology was done a disservice include Mariana's treatment of her group therapy clients, the lack of boundaries between herself and her clients, and the violation of ethics in failing to report or provide counsel and resources when one of her patients exhibits self-harm and violent tendencies and behaviors that clearly illustrate mental health issues and a deteriorating condition. This included stalking, emotional outbursts, and threats to continue self-harming or harm Mariana. Mariana also uses her psychotherapy credentials to lie her way into an active crime investigation where seemingly the cops are all too willing to look the other way? It's a gross violation of her privileges and during her violation of the investigation, she fails time and again to provide any psychotherapy help or resources to individuals she encounters who clearly need mental health assistance, are in danger themselves or exhibit potentially harmful behavior towards her (i.e. more stalking). And again, Mariana is a group therapist - she doesn't work and isn't licensed as an individual therapist, so I wasn't able to suspend my belief that she would even be helpful to the investigation anyway. Those troubling aspects aside, from a fundamental development level, the plot never felt fully fleshed out and the characters felt like caricatures. The characters were monstrously overworked yet somehow super forgettable. I had trouble remembering each male character and often forget about them until Mariana ran into them and they gave her creepy serial killer vibes all over again. Seemingly every man introduced seemed to scream I AM A CREEP, SUSPECT ME. They all make her uncomfortable, they're all trying too hard to be close to her, several actually STALK her (which we never discuss???), and yet somehow we're to believe Mariana has got this all handled and has no concerns over all the suspicious men circling her. Honestly, the ploy to make them all red herrings was so obvious it was cringey. Zoe never really felt like her own character, rather it felt like her purpose was just to be a convenient person for Mariana to walk around campus with and sometimes talk to instead of trying to 'solve' the crime through her own rambling internal monologues. The ending is where every flaw, loose end, and half-baked idea truly shows. (view spoiler)[Instead of allowing the Maidens society aspect to be a vehicle through which female power, ownership of sexuality, and intellect could be used to execute violence and autonomy - even retribution on the men who harmed them, he relegated the society to a bunch of girls lovestruck and lusting after a hot professor. Instead of making Zoe a nuanced, complex person whose grief manifested into a cunning, manipulative, and violent adult, he made her a pawn to a dead psychopath who seems more myth than anything else, imbued with too much importance and influence. Zoe's mental health journey and ultimate emergence as a murderer could have been a fascinating character study on grooming and sexual trauma and grief, instead, it was just vapid and trite. Now for what is perhaps the most troubling aspect of this book. The reveal that Zoe was the murderer the whole time was wholly obvious from the very beginning, so it wasn't the lack of surprise that was troubling, but rather the explanation for why she committed the crimes. In a classic "let me explain the whole grand evil plan to you as I'm about to kill you" move, Zoe confesses to Mariana that she had had an affair with Mariana's dead husband. Sebastian, Zoe's surrogate father, was a pedophile who had been raping and grooming Zoe since she was 15 all under Mariana's nose. Sebastian and Zoe planned to kill Mariana and take her money until Sebastian accidentally drowned on vacation with Mariana. So, in an act of love and obsession, Zoe decides to execute their plan anyway, by killing off her friend first to lure Mariana to Cambridge, set up her professor, and then kill Mariana off so Zoe can get the money....It's unclear what Zoe thinks having Mariana's money will do for her if Sebastian is dead, but ok. After the reveal and some very poor and illogical thwarted attempted murder of Mariana, Zoe is arrested and taken to the psych ward and Mariana never really deals with the reveal. The use of sexual exploitation, pedophilia, and rape for shock and entertainment value without proper respect to the topic is appalling. Again, Mariana is a trained psychotherapist, the book uses psychology abundantly when it's convenient but absolutely no time is spent treating this trauma and topic with due care and respect. There is no discussion for treatment and recovery, victims, or even the behaviors that might enable this - grooming, exploitation of grief over Zoe's parent's loss, manipulation, narcissism, an abuser's perceived god complex, power hunger, and inadequacy issues, etc. None of that is explored with Sebastian, the abuser, and we're left uncertain about Zoe's mental health and future. I say this again because it merits repeating, it is clear that Michaelides struggled to write from a female character's perspective and he did a poor job of it. This is not authentic to any female perspective I have ever read or would have and simply fails to do justice to the harrowing pain and experience suffered by both Zoe and Mariana. (hide spoiler)]For the blatant disrespectful handling of psychology, mental health, pedophilia, rape, and grooming, this is not a book I would feel comfortable recommending. Thank you Celadon books for my ARC in exchange for an honest review.
3748377870	2.5 stars: ta ta ta ta here comes my unpopular review alert! Yes, I disappointed! Yes, I was truly expecting something earth shattering, soul crushing, mind bending, grey cell fryer, unputdownable! What went so wrong with me?-one dimensional, very dislikable characterization -too many plot holes bigger than the cracks in my head!-Slow, flat, boring beginning-Too much unnecessary misdirection about the identity of the murder even though it’s so obvious from the beginning -Meeting with the one of the most useless and miserable investigation team who are always three steps behind a psychiatrist who knows nothing about murder investigation The things I liked:Short, easy to read chaptersReturning back to same universe where Silent Patient’s story executed( could third book be a crossover! Fingers crossed!) Academic murder mystery premise with Greek mythology vibes Delicious Cambridge atmosphere, detailed depictions about the surroundings which takes us virtual vacation to this epic, historical place! Some parts of the final revelation is also well executed even though there are still so many questions in my head which are still not satisfyingly answered! Storyline: when I read the blurb which informs us this is claustrophobic, enigmatic, mythology, dark murder mystery about young women students who were brutally killed as a part of a ritual, I was so excited about this interesting premise. But our meeting with a group of women students called Maidens which is conducted by their narcissistic, flirting professor Edward Fosca took too long! We lost so much time with inner turmoil of heroine: her sadness, grief, her depression etc. After being introduced to our sad, grieving heroine Mariana Andros, we observed one of her group session and met with her obsessed passion Henry who might be watching and stalking her day and night. Then we learn her tragic past: She lost everyone in her life: including her parents, sister and her beloved husband which makes her think she’s punished by the gods of wrath! Her niece Zoe who is her only family member, a student At Cambridge calls her to inform her close friend might be missing. When Mariana decides to check on her niece by taking a trip to the university where she has been also a student and met her husband, she realizes there’s a murder investigation and her niece is right. Her close friend Tara is brutally murder. Mariana decides to console her niece, spending more time at the place by conducting her own investigation. Her number one suspect is professor Edward Fonseca who might be the lover of the victim and he’s also finder of mysterious Maidens group. Tara was also the member of this group and unfortunately she was not the only one brutally killed! Somebody is after the maidens and he/ she is adamant to finish what he/she started! Overall: I’m rounding up 2.5 stars to 3 not so satisfied, it could be so much better, but there’s still interesting and intriguing premise of the story made me finish it stars! I wish I was one of the admirers of this book but I missed the author’s claustrophobic, intense, brilliant mind games, psychological, distorted, smart twists and gripping writing style he performed at Silent Patient! Third one is the charm! I think his next work will be so much better! So many thanks to Macmillan Reading Insiders club for providing me this readers’ advance copy in exchange my honest opinions.bloginstagramfacebooktwitterm
3849661757	They say you always chase your first high. And that's the way it is with me and Alex Michaelides. His first book The Silent Patient is one of my all-time favorites. I still remember the visceral experience of reading that book—the headiness of an unputdownable thriller, the gut punch of that reveal. It's seared into my memory.So it's no wonder every mystery/thriller I've picked up since then, that is the experience I'm hoping for. And now Alex Michaelides has come out with his second book. Of course my expectations are immense. I want the high of his first book again.So did The Maidens deliver? Yes, but not to the tune of The Silent Patient.Mariana is called to Cambridge when her niece Zoe's closest friend is brutally murdered. Mariana soon realizes that this idyllic campus of higher learning conceals something sinister lurking beneath the surface. The dead girl was a member of The Maidens, a secret society of beautiful female students led by the charismatic Professor Fosca. Mariana immediately suspects Fosca and becomes obsessed with proving his guilt. She must stop him before more innocent lives are lost.This story feels unusual and intriguing right off the bat. Its use of Greek mythology adds this creepy and almost otherworldly atmosphere to the tale. Every page is permeated with an ominous foreboding, as if misfortune could befall at any moment, and it made for a most unsettling and tantalizing read.We are introduced to a small but interesting cast of characters, all harboring secrets and puttering around in their own suspicious behaviors. As the story progresses, I can't help but take each person, mull over their actions and try to suss out their true intentions. For me, this deliberation of each character is one of the most entertaining parts of reading a murder mystery.However, it did take me a while to warm up to this story. I found the initial buildup to be on the slow side. There was a fair amount of background information to introduce and also a lot of references to Greek mythology and psychotherapy. But once it got going, the pacing tightened up and I was hooked, all the way until the very end. And what a fun ending it was.But to enjoy this story, it's important to go in with the right expectations, namely that it's no The Silent Patient. How could it be, right? What are the chances you would write a book—your first book—and have it be hailed by many as the greatest thriller ever, then write another book and have it be the greatest again? Pretty much none (no offense to Alex Michaelides). This doesn't have the compulsive readability of his first book nor the jaw-dropping reveal, but I still found it to be an entertaining thriller in its own right.Recently, I decided to read The Maidens again. There were so many negative reviews of this book, I wondered if I imagined my enjoyment of it. But no, I enjoyed it just as much on the second go-around. I happily chomped it up over a few fun-filled hours. At this point, I can safely put Alex Michaelides on my list of must-read authors. There is something about his writing and his stories that just draws me in, and I'm always left surprised in the best ways possible. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Silent PatientThe Fury~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧
3160279846	I need to start by saying Michaelides's The Silent Patient was totally my thing a couple of years back. I know the author didn't exactly do anything unique with that book, but I found it an impossible-to-put-down kind of psychological thriller. The writing kept me on the edge of my seat and I enjoyed the twists and turns.And, to be fair, for a while The Maidens gave me a similar feeling. Maybe not quite as compelling as the author's debut, but I've discovered I really like the way Michaelides weaves just the right amount of literature, art, and Greek tragedy references into his murder mysteries. For me, it's more Dan Brown level hidden messages and puzzle-solving than, say, The Secret History, but if you're looking for a pageturner, that's hardly a bad thing.This one sees Mariana Andros going back to Cambridge, her alma mater, when a friend of her niece is murdered on campus. Initially going for support, Mariana stumbles into an isolated world of charismatic professors, exclusive groups of beautiful students, and a whole lot of tragedy. The general kind, as well as the Greek.I liked Mariana, who was dealing with her own grief behind the scenes. What I didn't like was the direction the book took in the later chapters. For one thing, I was fairly convinced early on that I had figured out the culprit, and I was right. But more than this, what came out as the reason behind everything was so baffling and out of left field that I was disappointed by it. I also just really dislike when (view spoiler)[a character who acted completely normal for the whole book suddenly pulls out a knife and turns "here's Johnny!" on us. (hide spoiler)]I'll still read whatever the author writes next, but this one wasn't as satisfying as I'd hoped.
4179036464	I’ve felt more tension between me and a ringing phone. It really took the “thrill” out of thriller and left me just with “…errr…?”
4026882435	i see dark academia and i come running. this is one of my most anticipated releases for the year and im so relieved it didnt let me down. i honestly inhaled this. AM is the master of short chapters. he truly understands how to get readers to say, ‘just one more and then i will go to bed.’ and then all of the sudden the story is over in the blink of an eye - thats how much the content and pacing hooked me. i loved the greek mythology and poetry, i loved the old-fashioned cambridge vibes, and i loved how those created the most compelling of mysteries. also, holy crap. when theo from ‘the silent patient’ appeared, i screamed. i absolutely love when authors have characters from their other books have cameos. it makes the reading experience so much more fun and totally has me wanting to pick up ‘the silent patient’ again. the only thing that really bothered me about this book, though, are the interactions between the MC and men. honestly, there are four separate male characters who throw themselves at her. but of course, she ‘doesnt know how beautiful she is (this is mentioned more than once - major eye roll),’ so she declines their advances and they either A) get very angry and offended by it, or B) they wont take no for an answer and consistently pester her. not to mention all of these interactions could be removed from the book with no consequence - i have no idea what purpose they serve. one time i could overlook, but multiple occurrences is just very poor characterisation and bad writing. putting that aside, this book truly does deserve the hype its getting. with intriguing ritualistic murders to engaging literary influences, this is a great sophomore novel for AM.↠ 4 stars

3828089758	This could possibly be my last book review ever....This book review is being written from a bed at Mayo Clinic. If you follow me, I have been plagued with a mysterious condition this last year and finally have discovered that I have a very dangerous heart problem. The excellent medical team here at Mayo Clinic is struggling to control my erratic heart rhythm, and I experienced a very serious cardiac incident tonight where the red lights were flashing, the alarm was blaring, and every medical professional was urgently paged to my room. There was a heavy ominous, clanging sound approaching my door, the crash cart arriving. It is true what they say about the white light (or maybe that is because I have been exceptionally good in my life). Although I am stable for now, the crash cart is being left outside my door. So with that please don't be upset if I don't respond right away with likes and comments. I promise that I am still as committed as ever about reading and books. These books have been an escape from my sorry excuse for a body.Alright, end melodrama.The Maidens was the second book that I read by Alex Michaelides with The Silent Patient being my first. I do agree with other reviewers that The Maidens was not as good as The Silent Patient. It did not have the same page turning quality. However, I very much did enjoy it and probably would have considered rating it 5 stars except for the ending. What did I enjoy? Michaelides does have a strong command of the mystery/thriller genre, and the short chapters kept me especially interested. His use of psychology interwoven with the book gave it an extra depth, a little treat to savor. Why did I hate the ending so passionately? Well I had to read the last page 3 times to understand what happened. 3 times. Talk about a let down. This is one of the most disappointing endings in my book history. I'm completely OK with open endings, and I actually prefer them in most cases but a confusing ending is not forgivable. I'm utterly gobsmacked that an author as talented as Michaelides would create an ending this horrible.Well, my friends, it has been my pleasure to have you through this last year. The compassion and kindness of the book community has meant the world to me and carried me through some very dark times. If I do find myself with a pinecone, please continue to be the light out into the world. If not, please leave your list of books you would read if you only had one week left to live. I no longer have the patience for 3-star or less books. And if all else fails, know that I will be thinking warm thoughts for you either in this dimension or the next.2025 Reading ScheduleJan A Town Like AliceFeb BirdsongMar Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr War and PeaceMay The Woman in WhiteJun AtonementJul The Shadow of the WindAug Jude the ObscureSep UlyssesOct Vanity FairNov A Fine BalanceDec GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Insta My Bookstore at Pango
3796230243	"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear."-C.S. Lewis, A Grief Observed3.5 starsI've decided to round my rating up a star, if for no reason other than I cannot stop thinking about this book and it got me out of a major reading slump. I wasn't as dazzled by The Silent Patient as most readers, yet as a debut it was undeniably entertaining and well crafted. The author has completely changed courses with his sophomore novel, The Maidens, and traded the world of flashy psychological thrillers for a literary murder mystery. Make no mistake, although this book has a quiet power, its short chapters and oppressive atmosphere are gripping. Academia and crime fiction go together like peanut butter and chocolate, so I think Michaelides has found a sweet spot in this particular sub-genre of suspense.Was this book perfect? No, but how many of them are, honestly? Yes, it will be too slow of a burn for some readers, especially those expecting a Silent Patient 2.0 type of read, but if you're willing to go into this one with an open mind and a fresh palate, and you enjoy the literary side of crime fiction, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the author's versatility in writing. Here we have a limited third person view, told strictly from Mariana's POV, and this is where I think most of my hesitance in giving the book 5 stars stems from. Third POV has a way of keeping the reader at a distance if we can't experience the story from multiple viewpoints, and I think seeing things play out from various character's experiences would have allowed me to get a little closer to the story and connect on a deeper level to the characters, rather than feeling like we were getting a condensed version of the tale shortened for time's sake. You will have to suspend your need for a believable, realistic investigation, as Mariana does things in ways that would never fly in real life. However, this made for a constant sense of moving from one scene to the next, which really ramped up the addictive factor for myself as a reader. The culprit might not come as a surprise to many seasoned suspense readers, although I will say it took me longer to figure out this reveal than it did in TSP, and even so I didn't have all the "hows" and "whys" just right, which is exciting. Overall, a quick read, and one that felt as if it brought me back to my original love of UK crime fiction. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.
3557429280	4.5 starsI’m so glad this lived up to the hype! 😍https://youtu.be/-Vgds8Hv5mM
3991866525	Wow: I thoroughly enjoyed the audiobook version of The Maidens, read by Louise Brealey and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith. Brealey's dramatic reading tone injected a mesmerizing sense of dread and suspense into the narrative, and Holdbrook-Smith's husky tone did an excellent job of creeping me out!Mariana Andros is in deep mourning: her beloved husband, Sebastian, died a year ago while they were on vacation in Greece. We watch as Mariana struggles to move on with her life, but one day she receives a panicked call from her niece, Zoe, her only living relative. Zoe is a student at Cambridge, and one of her school friends, Tara, has disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Zoe's fears are confirmed that very evening when Tara's body is found: she had been brutally murdered.When Mariana arrives at Zoe's college the next day, she is disturbed to discover that the charismatic Professor Edward Fosca has seduced the entire college. Mariana immediately suspects that Edward Fosca is behind the deaths of several of The Maidens - six young female students who are Fosca's adoring and devoted acolytes. Zoe's friend Tara had been one of those Maidens. Then, almost the very next day, another Maiden is murdered ....As you would expect from a thriller, there were a ton of red herrings and loads of misdirection in this novel - as well as the potential for two unreliable narrators. The story is told from two alternate points of view: Mariana, in the third person, and a mysterious psychopath who regales us with harrowing recollections of his abusive childhood. (That poor dog, and what it revealed about his family dynamic! That was a jaw dropper.)I have to say, my most favourite character in this novel was young Fred: he just cracked me up and I was rooting for him all the way (but don't count him out as a suspect - just saying!) I'm still chortling with laughter at all of his "moves"- I'd take an apple from him each and every time!I did briefly suspect the culprit/s - no spoilers here - but I was still gasping with horror and applauding with delight at that action-packed ending. And despite other Goodreads reviewers' lower ratings for this one, I have to confess that I prefer The Maidens over The Silent Patient. I am not fond of dry, emotionless thrillers. I like stories with messy relationships and the potential for a fresh start. I enjoyed Michaelides's sense of humour and playfulness in this book: Fred's scenes with Mariana introduced a lighter tone in an otherwise fraught and gloomy atmosphere. (I suspect that die-hard thriller fans frowned at this. My Eternally Hopeful/Sentimental Self just cheered instead!!) Fate and Nature were also given character roles in this story. Fred's uncanny premonitions, the staring swan, Mariana's repeated supplications to the implacable Demeter, and the sudden storm that erased Sebastian from her life - it was as if man and Nature were in battle with one another, and for once, although Mariana would not have believed it, the Gods were on her side. I'm rating this one a 5 out of 5 because I was truly entertained. My thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley for an advance copy of the audiobook in exchange for an honest review. (P.S. I have now listened to the audio version of the The Silent Patient. I had to increase my rating for that one because the audiobook was so well done, but I still prefer The Maidens! I suspect that if more reviewers had listened to the audiobook, The Maidens would have a much higher rating. This would make a great movie! )P.P.S: Just read an online interview Michaelides did recently: The Maidens has in fact been optioned for a movie! I, for one, will definitely be in line to watch it! The audiobook was spellbinding, so imagine what the movie will do to me! Plus, I can't wait to see who plays Fred - I loved that guy!)
5181606270	I'm all for unlikable characters, but miss Mariana had me wanting to hit my head against a wall. :) Pair that with an underwhelming ending and this book landed in forgettable territory with me.
3744981900	rtc 10/31i really really hated this tho sorry to spoil ya
3987024779	Mariana just knew that Edward Fosca was a murderer. Edward Tosca was guilty but she just couldn't prove it and she might never be able to prove it. She thought he was a monster and she didn't want him to walk free. He thinks he got away with it, she thought. He thought he had won but Mariana was determined to outsmart him and she will catch him. Zoe's phone call after the Monday Evening Group was how it all started. That is how the nightmare began. Zoe was her niece and Mariana is a group therapist. Edward Fosca is a charismatic Greek Tragedy professor at Cambridge University. All the staff and students love him, especially a group of female students called The Maidens. When Mariana receives Zoe's phone call she finds out that one of the maidens, who is Zoe's friend, was murdered in Cambridge. Mariana is determined to stop the murderer even if it costs her everything including her own life. It took me awhile to get into the story but once I got into it I felt like I was captivated. The book is filled with red herrings and some Greek mythology. I thought it was atmospheric and written very well. I loved the short chapters. There are a lot of unlikable characters. I loved most of the book and the ending surprised me but it didn't work very well for me. I loved the author's book, The Silent Patient and I loved this one too. This one was a five star book for me until I reached the ending. I want to thank the publisher, Macmillan for the ARC of The Maidens by Alex Michaelides in exchange for an honest review.Now Available!!
4064568893	It felt as if a kind of pestilence, a plague, were spreading through the college—like in a Greek myth, the sickness that destroyed Thebes; an invisible airborne poison drifting through the courtyards—and these ancient walls, once a refuge from the outside world, no longer offered any protection. When Zoe calls her aunt from Cambridge to tell her that her best friend has gone missing, Mariana Andros, a group therapist in London, heads to her alma mater immediately. In no time she has ID’d a likely suspect and proceeds to find out everything she can, hoping, expecting to show that Professor Edward Fosca is a murderer. Alex Michaelides - image from The Irish Times – photo by Manuel VazquezHe certainly seems a likely candidate. A gifted teacher of classics, Fosca (This name derives from the Latin “fuscus”, meaning “gloomy, dark, black, (voice) hoarse, hollow, cavernous, (of thoughts) dark, secret, occult” - uh, oh - from name-doctor.com) has a Svengali-ish charm. He has assembled around him a small cult, female students who dress alike, attend private instruction with him, and who knows what else? They are known as The Maidens. Zoe’s friend, Tara, had been a member. They, under the leadership of Fosca, are into an ancient cult that was particularly focused on the line between life and death. Mariana couldn’t help but feel a little skeptical—her background in group therapy told her, as a rule, to be suspicious of any group in love with a teacher; those situations rarely ended well. But, Mariana may not be in the best frame of mind to take this all on. We would expect that a trained psychotherapist would be a good judge of people, but looking at the world from behind the veil of her grief, gives us cause to question her judgements. She is still mourning the loss of her beloved husband, Sebastian, who had drowned a year ago, while they were vacationing on the island of Nexos, a vacation she had pushed him to take. Guilt much? Tarquin and Lucretia - image from WikimediaMichaelides offers us a list of alternate suspects. Among them are a dodgy university porter, an obsessed patient of Mariana’s, the Maidens themselves, and a young man who seems particularly enamored of Mariana, persists in wooing her, and who claims an ability to foresee things.Mariana picks up some collateral support, including a former mentor still at the university, and an erstwhile school chum, who is now consulting with the police. He offers her access to investigation intel, over the objections of his superior, DI Sangha, in the seemingly-mandatory dickish cop role. Tennyson - image from The Daily Mail There are some of the elements of a cozy here, the amateur sleuth, with a friend on the force, the violence taking place off-screen, local sources that help one suss out the landscape, and quirky secondary characters. But this one is more a thriller, with sharper teeth. It features an undercurrent of dread well beyond the mystery of a simple whodunit. The violence, even though we get no front seat to it, is biting. No Miss Marple, Mariana is not merely an outside observer, but a participant in this drama. And a potential victim. I thought a lot about the secretive nature of groups as I was writing - especially within Cambridge. There are groups within groups. I studied group therapy myself, that's what I specialize in. It all goes back to the classic mysteries that I love, from authors like Agatha Christie: Everything is always set in an enclosed location, like an isolated house, a train, a private island. Cambridge is similar. Trinity College - image from The Maidenssociety.comTennyson comes in for multiple mentions. Greek mythology figures large and Mariana even finds herself succumbing to a bit of atavistic religiosity at times. The mythology that permeates the novel is a particularly fun element, offering an incentive to crank up the search engine of one’s choice and dig in a bit. You may or may not recall the ups and downs of Demeter and Persephone, but there are some other items from ancient Greek stories that I bet you never heard of. It is always fun to learn these things. Michaelides grew up on Cyprus where, he says, Greek mythology was in the air. The old stories were part of general cultural knowledge, with the old plays being regularly restaged, like how we generate new films of Spiderman or Jane Austen novels here.Return of Persephone, by Leighton – image from Holographical ArchetypesAdditional spice is provided by seven chapters that offer a psycho-side view of the world, an ongoing battle-royale between the dark side and the fading light. Is this our killer? Michaelides has a background in psychology, specifically group therapy, so writes strongly about both psychopathology, and treatment.He was a screenwriter for twenty years before his first novel, The Silent Patient, was published to huge success. The lessons he learned from that experience translate into a fast-paced read, strong on visual flair, with excellent atmospherics and tension-building. We can easily engage with our lead. Mariana seems a decent sort. She has suffered a terrible loss, which increases our sympathy for her. It is not hard to root for her to ferret out the killer, and to remain alive. Leda and the Swan, date unknown, by Franz Russ the Younger (1844-1906) - image from the site Mara, MariettaThere were a few things that bothered me in the book. How could Seb, who was fit and a good swimmer be drowned by a stormy sea? Surely, he knew his limits. Why would anyone go to dinner at the private rooms of a suspected murderer and not tell anyone where they were going? Most significantly there are two characters involved in a major plot twist at the end. While there were some breadcrumbs established for one of them, it seemed to me that the hints re the other were sorely lacking.That said, the bottom line is that The Maidens is a fun read, a real page-turner that will get your blood pumping, and offer an opportunity to refresh, or learn for the first time, some fascinating Greek mythology. Death was no stranger to Mariana; it had been her traveling companion since she was a child—keeping close behind her, hovering just over her shoulder. She sometimes felt she had been cursed as if by some malevolent goddess in a Greek myth, to lose everyone she ever loved.

3641139573	In "The Silent Patient", artist Alicia Berenson stopped speaking after shooting her husband in the face 5 times. Her only explanation, a self portrait, titled Alcestis-after the tragic heroine of the Greek Tragedy, by Euripides.Author Alex Michaelides, revisits the Greek Tragedies again, with his sophomore novel, "The Maidens".The nightmare begins with a phone call. Mariana Andros is a brilliant, but troubled group therapist, grieving the loss of her beloved husband, Sebastian, when her niece, Zoe, calls from Cambridge where she is a student-afraid that her close friend, Tara may have been murdered.When the body is found, it resembles the death of a Greek Goddess.Tara had just confided in Zoe, that their Greek Tragedy Professor, Edward Fosca, had threatened to kill her. But, the investigators do not believe what Zoe has to say. After all, the charismatic teacher is adored by all-his lectures drawing large crowds, of zealous followers, who often erupt in applause when he is finished speaking. And, he has an alibi-6 students who claim to have been revising with him until 10 PM-6 beautiful, favored women, referred to as "The Maidens". It isn't possible that they would all lie for him, is it? Another body is found, yet another Greek Tragedy depicted.Mariana is determined to outwit the Professor, to protect Zoe, but this may be her biggest challenge yet. After reading several tepid reviews for this one, I was hesitant to begin, but I found the traditions of Cambridge fascinating! Students drinking and debating with their professors, private gardens and dining rooms, student rooms with fireplaces and "bedders" who take care of them.I was googling the "The Eagle", the oldest Pub in Cambridge, and the RAF bar, so I could picture the graffiti covered ceilings, described. I envisioned the misty, cobblestoned streets, and the echoing footsteps following Mariana.The story is a literary mystery, exploring the psyche, and Greek Mythology, with a few murders thrown in. A bit of a slow burn-but never boring for me, with short chapters which moved things along.But, where the ending of "The Silent Patient" was extremely satisfying for me, this one, though surprising, took a turn I did not care for at all. And, there were a couple of loose ends..What I thought could be 5 stars, became 4. Still, I love the author's writing, and will be auto-requesting all future work!TRIGGER WARNINGS: Family Dog Killed, Slaughter of Sheep describedThank You to Celadon Books for my gifted copy!It was my pleasure to provide a candid review!NOW AVAILABLE!!
3786323260	going into this book i thought it was just “okay” i thought it was going to be predictable and it was like reading a dark academia book but instead of following a student it followed an outsider, i thought i already knew what was going to happen but the book kind of plays on that. if you read dark academia a lot, you think that you know what’s going to happen in this book but honestly you don’t and that’s the best part. the plot twist in this book was so great. it literally made me gasp out loud.
3986808691	There’s a justifiable amount of buzz swirling around Alex Michaelides’s sophomore novel, The Maidens, given the success of his 2019 debut, The Silent Patient. Said buzz (and early reviews) made me wonder a few things before I even cracked it open, so as an act of public service I’m sharing my pre-read Q’s with my post-read A’s. Q: Do you have to read The Silent Patient beforehand? Or in my case, if you have read it, do you need to remember anything about it? A: Not really, though you’ll miss out on some things if you don’t. I'd suggest at least reviewing a plot summary of TSP to bring yourself up to speed. Q: Do you need to be familiar with Greek mythology beforehand, since it plays a central role in the storyline? A: Nope! Everything is explained (maybe even in a little too much detail for those who already know Persephone, “The Maiden,” is Queen of the Underworld).Q: What’s this I hear about animals being harmed? A: There are separate scenes of sheep and a family dog being slaughtered. Q: Will I like it more than The Silent Patient? A: Probably not. It stands pretty well on its own, but the odds of it exceeding high expectations aren’t great. As with any thriller, your overall enjoyment will come down to if you see the twists coming and find the ending satisfying. I personally was surprised by the big reveals and thus appreciated the novel’s conclusion. I’m looking forward to seeing what this author does next.I received advance copies of the book and audiobook courtesy of Orion Publishing Group and Macmillan Audio, respectively, via NetGalley. Both formats are recommended.Blog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/IG: @confettibookshelf
2842505647	Maybe a 2.5 / Some will enjoy it more than me, I'm sure. Thanks to the publisher for my advanced copy! OUT on June 15, 2021A handsome Greek Tragedy professor at Cambridge University forms a special group of students he calls "The Maidens". When one of the girls is murdered, all fingers point to Professor Fosca. This is Alex Michaelide's sophomore book, and I had some high expectations. I have to say this one never "took off" for me. A rather gruesome murder mystery, with dramatic characters that seemed too over the top. I didn't care for any of them either. This one was lacking on many fronts in my opinion. warning Animal abuse/death
4036032812	Just like TSP, the short chapters made it impossible to put down and the mystery kept me guessing until the very end. Fingers crossed for a third book sometime soon 🤞🏼.
4104168627	Nici prea-prea, nici foarte-foarte...Mariana (36 de ani, văduvă) e terapeut, se presupune că a făcut studii de specialitate (psihologie, psihodiagnostic), că s-a inițiat în finețurile sufletului, dar nu e în stare să priceapă absolut nimic din ce se întîmplă în campus. Toate ipotezele ei (cu privire la cei din jur și la vinovat) sînt greșite. Asta se vede de la o poștă. Investigația ei e bezmetică. Intuiția Marianei funcționează tare prost. Mai are și idei fixe, obsesii. Este convinsă că asasinul este profesorul de Studii clasice, Edward Fosca. Evidența n-o convinge că se înșală. Toate personajele din roman par să fi suferit cîte o traumă cumplită în prima copilărie: Mariana, săraca, a suferit chiar mai multe. Au avut părinți violenți, tați alcoolici, mame cu suflet de gheață. Michaelides pare a crede că toți indivizii care au avut copilării nefericite pun mîna pe cuțit și sar la gîtlejul inocenților. Chiar dacă vine din Freud, această credință e simplistă. În rest, în Fecioarele, polițiștii sînt stupizi (unul dintre ei, șeful, poartă turban, după moda din India) și psihologii orbi / opaci. La sfîrșit, asasinul e scos din joben, după judecata că dacă există (trei) victime, trebuie să existe și un criminal (foarte afectat psihic).De la un capăt la altul, romanul e perfect neverosimil. O prefer pe mătușa Agatha...
4033669649	Mariana Andros, a group therapist, receives a phone call from her niece, Zoe informing her that her friend, Tara is missing, and her fears that Tara may have been murdered. Mariana goes to Cambridge to be with her worried niece, to provide support and comfort. When Tara's body is found, Mariana who is still reeling from the death of her husband, becomes convinced that Edward Fosca, the Greek Tragedy professor is responsible. But Fosca is untouchable. He is one of the most popular professors at Cambridge, his lectures are full, students and staff look up to him and his 'special' study group known as "The Maidens" has provided him with an alibi. When more bodies are found, Mariana becomes obsessed with proving Fosca is the killer despite his alibis. Throughout the book, readers watch as Mariana attempts to bring down a killer. But are her suspicions correct? Is her grief driving her quest for answers? She appears to take the entire investigation very personally. There is also an undercurrent of doubt that had me suspecting various characters of being the killer. Speaking of characters, the ones in this book are an interesting bunch. Some likeable, some unlikeable, some odd, some creepy, some arrogant, and some that I did not trust. Plus, there is a nice little tie in to The Silent Patient in this.There is a lot of talk of Greek mythology, but I did not find it to be overwhelming, in fact, I enjoyed it. For me, this book started slowly and kept picking up speed as the book progressed. I enjoyed how things unraveled. Of course, there were times, I rolled my eyes and shook my head, but I did not mind. Some saw the ending coming, but I did not. I look forward to his next book! Curious to see if he will continue to use Greek Mythology in his storytelling.Thank you to Celadon Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com
3518108706	Sorry, unpopular opinion here. I loved The Silent Patient, but this one totally fell short for me. I didn't like any of the characters, they lacked depth and nuance, particularly Mariana. She didn't ring true for me as a therapist, and I really dislike armchair detectives! I couldn't figure out why she was inserting herself into the investigation as it had nothing at all to do with her. She kept misrepresenting herself as a therapist involved with the investigation and she wasn't, which was totally unethical.There are so many red herrings in this book that it borders on ridiculous. I wasn't even sure some of the people were actually real within the story because they were such caricatures. I'm also not into Greek mythology so all of that was just lost on me, and it wasn't even really relevant when all is said and done (minor spoiler, sorry, but it isn't really). I totally could not stand the ending. The "big reveal twist" was completely unbelievable and I nearly laughed because it came out of nowhere, yet was also so obvious. Maybe he is setting it up to take us back to the world of The Silent Patient (because there's definitely crossover potential here with the overlapping cases, patients, and location) and if he wraps this story up a bit better I could get behind that. Fortunately, the chapters are super short for the most part so I was able to power through this book fairly quickly. I was just waiting for the big "wow" I received while reading The Silent Patient and it never happened. The plot has so much buildup for so little payoff. I will chalk this up to a lackluster sophomore effort after such a stunner of a first novel and will look forward to his next novel. I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.
5881519681	Oof that was awesome! Can't believe it took me two years to finally pick this up. Loved the eerie vibes and it's perfect for an October/autumn read. I won't say this was better than The Silent Patient was it was good regardless. Like TSP, I found this one to be predictable too. I knew who the real killer would be in the beginning of the second half itself. The only thing that shocked me was the truth about Sebastian, and it sickened me to my core. Mariana was an okay-ish protagonist. I liked her in the first half a lot and her zeal to find the truth. But she soon forgot (in the second half) that as a therapist herself she should not be judging someone so harshly and certainly not jump to conclusions about them without having an open mindset, at least listen to that person first. Her struggle with grief and loss was something that was well written and I appreciate the author being true to it. Despite the reality of Theo, I liked his short cameo. It had me on edge. One thing that felt irrelevant to me was Henry's storyline. I believe he didn't really contribute to the story much and with or without him we reach the same conclusions. I get it was somewhat important to Mariana but yeah, not really 😅Overall, this was a fun thriller and I had a great time with it. ~•~•~This has been on my physical shelf since 2021..am not proud about it 🙈 But taking a short break from romance and fantasy so might as well🤷‍♀️
3958850440	HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY! Cambridge University is a prestigious one that excels at churning out successful students. It also has some of the most well-respected professors...except that one might be a murderer.That is what Mariana thinks. She is a group therapist living in London, and drops everything when her niece, Zoe, calls her. Zoe’s best friend has been murdered on campus where they are both Cambridge students. Mariana makes her way to the University, where she herself attended years prior.With bittersweet memories of the college, Mariana quickly learns that Zoe thinks Professor Edward Fosca is guilty of the murder. Mariana finds herself agreeing. As an instructor of Greek tragedy, he seems to hone in on a particular story given the circumstances. On top of that, what is up with the secret society he runs...The Maidens? After another murder takes place, Mariana becomes determined to stop Fosca...and will not stop digging into the investigation......no matter what danger she might be putting herself in.I was a bit nervous about reading The Maidens. First, I wasn’t a big fan of the author’s debut novel, The Silent Patient, and had guessed the ending early on. In addition, I recently finished a novel where Greek Mythology played a part (Madam), and that was not an enjoyable experience...to say the least. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This mystery kept me engaged the entire time, and while Greek Mythology plays a role, it didn’t bore me. Nor did it try to suffocate my tender brain. 🧠 The progression of suspense is a bit slow at times, but I never noticed while actively reading. The writing is a bit simple, leaving the characters mostly one dimensional. There was nobody I particularly cared about, and yet the words flowed effortlessly with some nice atmosphere. It’s also a quick read with short chapters. As for the ending, I suspected part of it at one point or another, but was genuinely surprised by another aspect of it. That was a treat! There is also a brief tie-in to The Silent Patient that I thought was really clever. Maybe it has to do with expectations, but Alex Michaelides’ sophomore effort is a win for me, and better than its predecessor. I’ll be looking forward to his next one. 3.5 stars rounded up.

4082904722	Mixed reviews, along with an unappealing cover, kept my expectations low, but I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed it. Mariana, a psychologist, is still in mourning over her husband’s untimely death. She’s truly all alone in the world, having also lost her parents and sister. Zoe, the niece she took in after her sister’s death, is all she has left. When Zoe calls with news of her friend’s murder, Mariana travels to Cambridge, where Zoe is a student. A professional colleague of Mariana’s draws her into the investigation, and it doesn’t take long for all suspicions to be focused on Professor Fosca, the creepy but magnetic professor who is beloved by his students and has a secret society comprised of seven girls, the “maidens”. Mariana is convinced of his guilt and will stop at nothing to prove it, especially after another murder of one of the maidens. I enjoyed the mystery but what the author pulled off so well was the atmosphere of Cambridge, as well as Mariana’s character with her troubled past and struggles with grief. I enjoyed the nod to a Greek tragedy, but it wasn’t overdone and there’s no need to be well versed in Greek mythology (I’m not!). Red herrings abound, and I turned my suspicious eye on nearly every character at different parts of the story. Even if the reveal wasn’t a complete surprise there was still a twist that took me completely by surprise. This was a fun book to play armchair detective with Marilayce, my friend and reading buddy. I dare say we weren’t very good at it with this one, but it was fun speculating! · I received both the digital e-book as well as the audiobook via NetGalley. I ended up preferring the audio, narrated by Kobna Holdbrook-Smith And Louise Brealey, because it was so well done.
3707717712	**Many thanks to @CeladonBooks and Alex Michaelides for an ARC of this book! Now in paperback!** The dreaded sophomore slump claims another... Mariana, head of a therapy group, studied her craft at Cambridge and found her way as a professional ever since. The tragic and untimely demise of her husband Sebastian, however, still haunts her and she can't shake the feeling that one of the patients in her group sessions may have a bit of a deadly obsession with her. All of these fears get put on the back burner when she receives a panicked phone call from niece Zoe, now also a student at Cambridge--there's been a horrific murder. Compelled by her familial duty and loyalty to her alma mater, Mariana returns to Cambridge to play detective and hones in on Edward Fosca, the debonair and brooding Greek Tragedy professor who has a gaggle of young female devotees known as the Maidens. Mariana's curiosity and suspicion of Fosca leads her to stick around her old stomping grounds, determined to get to the bottom of these mysterious circumstances and prove that Fosca is the mastermind behind the crimes. But when a curious and threatening postcard with a Greek inscription begins making an appearance and the body count rises, Mariana finds herself in possession of one of the cards marking her as a potential victim---and running out of time. Could she be the next female to fall?The good:*Yet another page-turning book from Michaelides. In this case, I think that might have more to do with short chapters and less to do with a compelling narrative, however. *Michaelides is still enthralled (and heavily inspired) by Greek tragedy of all sorts. References abound here, and fans of that genre will certainly enjoy all of the nods. I don't consider myself well-versed in any respect and my basic knowledge of some of the mythology mentioned was enough to keep me interested---especially in the group of the Maidens themselves.*The final twist is solid enough where I didn't guess it--at least not entirely. A multi-layered approach is what saved this one, or I think the twist would have been somewhat transparent based on the evidence.*tie-in to Michaelides' first book. Fans always appreciate a call back. Can't say it necessarily added anything to the plot here, but I still enjoyed the references.The not-so-good:*This book, pretty much from start to finish, felt very far-fetched. The opening section focuses almost entirely on Mariana's therapy group, but afterwards, we heard very little from any of its members.*I also found it hard to believe that everyone in the Cambridge community was instantly entranced and intrigued by Mariana. Not only that, all of the characters didn't find it strange that she returned to play detective and everyone was eager to spill any secrets they had to help her investigation. (view spoiler)[I also found it odd she had so many romantic suitors, or potential suitors, especially Fred. It might have been convenient for the plot, but honestly? Seemed hard to believe. (hide spoiler)]*The dialogue came off a bit corny at times and had me rolling my eyes a bit. I didn't have that feeling whatsoever while reading Silent Patient, so I am hoping it was specific to this book since Michaelides is normally a solid writer.*For a book that should have felt like it moved at a breakneck pace, I struggled to stay engaged and it took me far longer to finish than I would have liked. What do many plot threads make? …A giant knot.While I appreciated the nuance, references, and some of the aura surrounding the Maidens, in this case the bad outweighed the good. I wholeheartedly believe, however, that Michaelides has carved a specific niche for himself in the thriller genre and will hopefully stun us back to silence with his next book!#TheMaidens #CeladonReads #Partner
3974599594	Mariana Andres receives a call from her distressed niece Zoe who is studying at Cambridge University. There has been a brutal murder and Zoe fears it is her friend Tara. Mariana travels to Cambridge as quickly as she can and becomes drawn into the dark orbit of Professor Edward Fosca who has a cult like coterie of followers known as The Maidens. Mariana is convinced of Fosca’s murderous guilt and her obsession to prove it leads her down an incredibly dangerous path. Wow! I absolutely love this book from start to finish. I love the way the author writes, he is so talented as he effortlessly pulls you into the storytelling and keeps you immersed in it. I read this oblivious to everything around me, utterly transfixed! Mariana and Fosca as central characters are polar opposites and are inspired choices. She lives uneasily on the edge and for the last year has been ‘behind the veil’ in a grey world of the grief of widowhood while he is mesmerising, dazzling, extremely confident and resembling a twenty first century Byron. The settings and descriptions of Cambridge and Greece (Mariana is half Greek) are wonderful and make you feel as if you are there witnessing the dreadful unfolding events and absorbing the atmosphere of life at this prestigious university. The plot is very clever and complex, unravelling like the Greek tragedies that are a constant through the narrative, indeed, Mariana feels she is cursed as in a Greek myth and is melancholic like Demeter. Of particular importance in the novel are Demeter and especially Persephone and it makes me want to read more Greek mythology. The Greek Gods element lends a very chilling atmosphere, you get ripples of unease, a paranoid sense of being watched and fears build as the ghosts of the past and present merge. All the essential ingredients of a Greek tragedy such as by Euripides are present in the plot as characters pit themselves against each other with revenge and retribution duly following and leading to the ultimate betrayal. The images of the Maidens is spine tingling as these very privileged young women are tangled in the seemingly glittering web of Fosca. The use of Tennyson as a thread throughout is also clever as his grief for the loss of Hallam and the poetry he write ‘In Memoriam’ mirrors Mariana’s grief. The tension escalates and you realise that the killer is very clever but also theatrical and this is very chilling. As all the layers build you have red herrings and distractions and so I do not foresee the truth which causes the veils in front of Mariana’s eyes to fall spectacularly.Overall, I strongly suspect this book will be one of my top picks of 2021 as it is just my kind of book. With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Orion for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.
3747282155	I loved it! I won't say this is the greatest thriller I've ever read, because it's perhaps not, but it IS incredibly clever and beautifully atmospheric, and I think it will satiate a lot of those die hard psychological thriller fanatics that have been on pins and needles waiting two years since Michaelides' debut release, The Silent Patient. While there were numerous similarities to his debut, there were noticeable differences, so one could never say this is simply a rewrite of Silent Patient. Maidens is more of a straight forward 'whodunnit?' murder mystery, set on a beautiful collegiate campus. I felt the characters in this novel were much more fleshed out (our protagonist is Mariana, a grieving widow and also psychologist) and complex, and I truly had no clue whodunnit, or what, if anything else might also be going on beyond the Maiden murders until the final reveal, which absolutely gutted me! Did not see that one coming! I loved that our protagonist from Silent Patient, Theo Faber, actually makes a few appearances in this novel, and I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out if this is pre-SP, or several years later?! I would definitely like to hear other opinions on that one! There are so many more brilliant things I could divulge about this wonderful novel, but I think it's best to go into this one fairly blind without any expectations, and just enjoy the ride. I sure know I did! You will not be disappointed! This will most likely be one of the top thrillers of 2021! A million thanks to Celadon Books for the beautiful advanced copy, you made my YEAR when you offered this ARC, and you undoubtedly have yourself another winner here!! Simply cannot wait until Mr. Michaelides' next release!
3890833931	4.5 stars! Gothic. Suspenseful. Mysterious. Mariana travels to Cambridge University to spend time with her grieving niece, Zoe, whose close friend was found murdered. Mariana, who went to the same school as Zoe, finds herself deeply affected by the murder near campus and becomes involved in the investigation. Using her group therapy career skills, Mariana offers to meet with “the Maidens”, a secret sorority group of female students, to see if they know more than they claim. This story gripped me with tension, atmosphere and suspense from page one. I felt deeply invested in Mariana and her determination to help solve the crimes. She was a fantastic main character who I loved rooting for. The atmosphere throughout the novel was engrossingly heavy. I loved the dark, mysterious, creepy, rain-soaked school campus and all that it brought to the story. The tension was thick and I had a constant sense of foreboding worry about what would happen next. The pace and flow consistently kept me glued to the pages and the short chapters were easy to fly through.There were unrealistic elements to the storyline but they didn’t bother me in the least. I was so wrapped up in the atmosphere, mystery and entertainment of the plot that I didn’t question a thing. I absolutely love this author’s writing!I was a HUGE fan of this author’s debut, The Silent Patient. It’s one of my favourite thrillers. I thought it was a brilliant and clever addition for the author to include a tie in to that book. It took me until the end to clue in on the tie in characters and connection to The Silent Patient and it definitely kicked up my enjoyment level a notch! This was a solid sophomore thriller that I was intrigued and captivated by from beginning to end. I eagerly await what this author creates next!Thank you to Celadon Books for sending me a physical ARC.
4200081105	2.0 stars— As a big fan of “The Silent Patient” I did not want to believe the negative reviews I had read prior to reading “The Maidens”. I guess I should have listened. “The Maidens” is a very, very slow developing murder mystery of several female students at Cambridge University. These women are all in a group called “the maidens” who meet regularly with the most popular professor at the university, Edward Fosca. Mariana, a group therapist, comes to the college out of concern for Zoe, her nIece, after Zoe’s best friend is murdered by the killer. Of course, Mariana gets wrapped up in the investigation while visiting her niece and soon every strange man at the university is attempting to either contact her, date her or threaten her. The evidence clearly points to Fosca since he teaches Greek tragedy and the suspect decides to leave postcards in the dorm rooms of each of the victims with sinister quotes from of all things, Greek tragedies. The book reads like a dumbed down “The Davinci Code” mixed with a bumbling version of Kinsey Millhone from the Sue Grafton novel series .The random, crazy suspects inserted in the story are so contrived that you know they are just red herrings. Mariana’s actions and words also seem far-fetched and not realistic which caused the whole book to fall flat. I enjoyed the ending, but it could not make up for the very slow pace of the rest of the book and a main character that was not relatable due to her unrealistic actions and responses to what was happening around her. Hopefully, Michaelides returns to form in his next book
3758862334	This book went from really interesting to boring to terrible. Disappointed because I loved the premise and it had so much potential.
3783769391	The ending is quite disappointing! And it was like I knew who it was all along. But I don't blame myself for enjoying the book more than I had anticipated. All I did was going into it with no expectations and that I knew I would like the writing.And dang! I did. I love the fast-paced, easy-to-follow writing so much!A story about serial killing of college girls following a pattern while our main character is almost sure who the killer might be.The characters are there right there in front of your eyes that you keep seeing them so superficially yet annoyingly nagging at your thoughts. Every character introduced made the reading more fun I would say!While the whole plot was much focused on making the readers to focus on one character to bring up the twist towards the end, it was rather quite easy to see what the plot was desperately trying to do. It's too easy to figure out who it would be.It's just that the big reveal fell flat and I'm not convinced at all.And the most annoying part of such who-did-it murder mysteries is that the so called strict, intimidating police officers did end up doing nothing. And it's quite frustrating to see this repeating over and over again. All talk but no action.I appreciate the cult kind of plot to explore more Greek mythology and writers such as Tennyson.But overall, a fast-paced thrilling serial killer murder mystery to read in one sitting. I liked the writing so much. I will read anything and everything by the author.
3797652008	Reading Vlog: https://youtu.be/jdi1Pwma13wRevising my review upon reflection… 2.5⭐Let me say first that this was a fun time but when I look back at this book, there are so many problems and so little pay off that I had to bump the rating down. I enjoyed how short the chapters were. It made the story seem faster and more compelling. The inclusion of Greek mythology was interesting but didn’t serve the plot in any way. It was a cool red herring but still a red herring.I can’t think of one character in this book that had any semblance of intelligence. The main character? Don’t make me laugh. The detectives? Criminally ill suited for their jobs. The professor? Okay, well he wasn’t dumb but everyone else is for letting him get away with what HAD to be sexual and emotional assault. He had a cult of young women worshipping him and the university just shrugged and said “but he’s attractive. What can we do?” Liiiiike, is this a joke?I really hated the plot twist. There was so much potential with the mythology and the cult but it just fell apart in the end.
3764093847	I got the arc of this book but it was completely messed up and I couldn't read it. I had to wait until release date to get the ebook and read it, in a way it was better than I expected but still not great. Since there are many reviews of this book already, I will keep this one short.I enjoyed reading the Silent Patient last year, it was a real page-turner and I couldn't put the book down. Although the start was close in the Maidens, I found myself engrossed in the story and finished it in a single sitting once things were in motion. That was the most fun about this book, its addicting quality. The characters weren't memorable nor that interesting. I questioned many of their decisions and I didn't find them relatable. While Marianne isn't a bad main character, I couldn't fathom a logical reason for involvement in the case, where's the police?? She has no training in this department and being a group therapist on its own isn't enough reason for me. The way she dealt with her grief was at least well-handled (apart from those *inserts supposedly relevant psychology fact*)As for the mystery itself, the motives were BS. They weren't believable at all nor there were any hints about them. While I didn't guess the culprit and I can see why it's them, the whole mystery reveal was very farfetched and underwhelming. It might sound like a negative review but when I read this book, I needed something quick and fun to read and this book was exactly that. Don't expect an innovative story nor very developed characters or even a satisfying resolution. Yet, if you want an entertaining & fast mystery read (the short chapters definitely helped), you can give this book a try. (Not) Thanks to publisher and Netgalley for sending me an e-arc of this book
5633171285	THIS MAN COULD WRITE HIS LITERAL TO-DO LIST AND I’D STILL BUY IT. SILENT PATIENT LOVERS THIS IS A MUST.now that we’re not screaming anymore…for real i have been searching for a thriller that even came close to the silent patient and kept failing. but another thriller by the same author was yet again 5+ stars. this review took me days to begin (not only because i was busy and sleepy) but because i felt as if i couldn’t give it the justice it deserves!murder mystery. every freaking character is suspicious. therapist trying to solve it all. plot twist (sort of guessed it but was still blown away). plot twist #2 (umm check my trigger warnings but WOW). greek mythology as well and even though i’ve never been a fan of greek myths it wasn’t too heavy. oh and an honorable mention as to how theo’s story in the silent patient started?! jaw dropped multiple times. *trigger warnings for gore, death, self-harm, sexual relations between adopted family members*
3782147962	Maybe more like 3.75. I shall mull for a bit. Ok, so there was some serious hype surrounding this one. I enjoyed The Silent Patient well enough so I was interested to see where the author would go with this one. Mariana works as a group therapist. She is still grieving the loss of her husband and true love Sebastian, whom she met at Cambridge University. When her niece Zoe calls from Cambridge to say a student has been found dead, Mariana rushes to her side to console her. A group of students known only as The Maidens are part of some elite club run by the charismatic and attractive Professor Fosca. It is unclear on the purpose of the club or why only girls can join. As other students are found dead, all members of The Maidens it becomes clear that something is very wrong. As Mariana does her own digging, much to the annoyance of the police, more and more secrets come to the surface. There were plenty of red herrings, and I liked the links to mythology, specifically Demeter and Persephone. My only gripe was on the cover it states “a climatic twist that you will never see coming.” High praise indeed. And although I didn’t guess all the ins and outs I did think (view spoiler)[ the way Zoe talked about Sebastian - her ‘Uncle’ was not quite right for just familial connection. I had a funny feeling about that throughout so wasn’t overly shocked when it turned out they’d been having an affair. (hide spoiler)]I loved all the elements of psychology that were included, how past trauma can lead to dark thoughts and crimes. Still don’t entirely trust that kid (whose name I have now forgotten) that Mariana met on the train. He was definitely a creeper and knew more info than she had given him. One final point (view spoiler)[ Zoe claims the only reason Sebastian married Mariana was to be closer to her. But they met in uni so I’m guessing that isn’t right. He must have loved her (or thought he did) in the beginning before meeting Zoe and everything my going south. I’d have loved a bit more on why Sebastian wanted to kill Mariana. I know we get the chapters from his childhood and how he seems to hate women from his mother leaving him with his abusive father. But is that the only reason? Why Mariana specifically? (hide spoiler)]I was entertained and gripped so I’ll stick with 4 stars I think 😊***********************My copy is finally available from the library! It’s been a long wait - glad I didn’t give in and buy it from Tesco the other day!I’m intrigued to see which side of the fence I end up on 😂

3751965508	Review posted on blog: https://books-are-a-girls-best-friend...Dark Academia at its Best or its Worst? Mariana is a Group Therapist, who is desperately trying to help others while dealing with her depression over the loss of her husband. Upon receiving a frantic phone call from her niece Zoe, who is at Cambridge, that a friend and classmate of hers has been murdered, Mariana goes to help. Upon Mariana’s arrival at Uni, it is immediately apparent that something sinister is going on, and Mariana plans to figure out what it is. Edward Fosca is a Professor, whom Zoe believes murdered her best friend. He has a presence that draws others to him, including that of “The Maidens” a group of extremely popular female students. While he appears guilty, he has an alibi for Tara’s murder. He was with the Maidens, of course.When another murder occurs, tensions run high. Clues are left behind. Somehow, only Mariana discovers them. Soon, it’s not just the students that are running scared. A somewhat compelling psychological suspense that gripped me until I got closer to the end when the storyline became somewhat far-fetched. Having guessed the culprit immediately, I hung in there, wondering why none of the characters in the novel caught on! A tie in to “The Silent Patient” occurs which I would have found intriguing had the timelines matched, however “The Silent Patient” and that entire storyline occurred before this book, not after. What I appreciated about this book however was the ominous feeling I got while reading it, part of which stemmed from the idea of a secret society, the atmosphere (I adore the setting of Cambridge), and everything that surrounded the character of Mariana - including her past and present and her work as a therapist.While I preferred this author’s prior book “The Silent Patient” - I enjoyed “The Maidens” and will be on the lookout for Alex Michaelides’ next book.This was another buddy read with Kaceey!Thank you to Macmillan / Celadon Books and NetGalley for the arc by Alex Michaelides in exchange for an honest review.Published on Goodreads, Twitter, and Instagram.
2840847719	3.5 FangsAfter reading the wonderful debut novel, The Silent Patient, I knew I would want to read the next book by Alex Michaelides.The Maidens is set in the University of Cambridge and the disappearance of a young woman whose body is found later.Mariana Andros is a psychotherapist. She is a widow and she's still grieving the loss of her husband, Sebastian. A man she adored and who brought her the love she was missing under her father's care. She is successful at her job as a group therapist. She leaves her job when her niece, Zoe calls her from Cambridge University where she is a student. Her friend Tara has disappeared and before she disappeared, she told Zoe she was afraid of Professor Edward Fosca. He was going to kill her!Fosca is the professor everyone wants to attend class and listen to and his classes always end with resounding applause. Fosca has a group of students he meets regularly with. They are all young women who go by the name of The Maidens. Tara was part of this group. Despite Zoe's claims and Mariana's growing suspicions, he has an alibi, The Maidens. They say he was with them. But are they covering up for him?Mariana was a student at Cambridge herself. She met Sebastian there too. For her, coming back is painful but she knows she can't let Zoe be alone. Investigating the murder and trying to catch a killer before some else gets hurts becomes paramount.I felt The Maidens had a slow start but it had a partial great twist at the end. One I did not see it coming. I enjoyed the crossover with Mariana interacting with Theo from the Silent Patient too. Some of the greek mythology felt redundant but maybe it's because I knew about Persephone from my teenage years.Cliffhanger: No3.5/5 FangsMrsLeif's Two Fangs About It | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram
3793125827	A widowed group therapist, her niece, and a dazzling Greek Tragedy professor become enmeshed in series of gruesome murders at Cambridge. One by one, the members of a special group of students known as The Maidens are found dead. The many references to Demeter and Persephone, as well as, other Greek Tragedies seem to be an attempt to give intellectual heft to this rather thin story. In short, this is melodramatic and cliched.
4020468637	This is probably the best book I've read this year. Again, Michaelides has done it. He has deceived me, with great writing, powerful characters, and a perfect plot. If he keeps writing like this, I'll have to read his books. Not only is this book a brilliant homage to all the classic female writers of whodunits, starting with the great Agatha Christie, it also shows a great love of the Greek tragedies and the way those stories shape our past and present. A must read.
3766142693	4.5This was ~fantastic~. I loved the mix of psychology, poetry, and mythology that were entertained in every bit of the story. It was so fast moving and I was so invested in Mariana. I loved the location being Cambridge and I really felt some dark academia vibes throughout the tale. While I will say the killer ended up being the person I first considered- it was done in such a way that I was left gasping. Small bits of it were part of my theory to explain the killers motives but the *extent* to which it went was not something I expected.
4074646073	This Review ✍️ Blog 📖 Twitter 🐦 Instagram 📷 Support me ☕ “Reading about life was no preparation for living it.” According to the author’s profile in GR The Silent Patient was the biggest-selling debut in the world in 2019! I think that puts a lot of pressure on the author to provide something with a high quality and sadly, I can’t say that this one lived to the expectations!The Maidens is a standalone story following Mariana Andros who is a group therapist, a friend of Mariana’s niece Zoe, is found murdered in Cambridge and she decides to visit to provide some support and decides to stay after that to uncover the truth. The story is a thriller/ mystery story and here’s the thing: The thriller part worked for me, I remember reading The Silent Patient with 4 of my friends and we all finished it within 24 hours because it was such a gripping read and The Maidens was kind of similar in that regard. The multiple short chapters and fast pacing made it an addicting read.What did not work for me was the mystery part, I figured out the murderer early on the story and I was so sure of it. Usually when a murder mystery story points to a character, it is safe to say that they did not do it. The author mentions his inspirations for the story and the authors that gave him joy when he was a teenager and he starts by mentioning the queen of mystery herself, Agatha Christie! I mentioned that the plot in the first book was similar to one of Christie’s books but the author put his own touch on it and I respected that. This time as a big fan of Christie, I can say that Agatha would have been disappointed.The writing is good most of the time, there are a few weird quotes but overall, I found it easy to read. The writing is also atmospheric specially with the dark academia settings!The characters are the downside of this book, Mariana is not someone I hated, but I wasn’t a big fan of her either. I think her job as a group therapist should made the psychological aspect stronger but she missed the most obvious things and only proved how bad at her job she is. Also let’s not forget the police, who almost do nothing in the book and are clueless when it comes to investigations. The males in the book were all creepy and I did not understand why. I thought some of the subplots would lead to something more important but they were actually left loose! “Don’t glorify the events of your life and try to give them meaning. There is no meaning. Life means nothing. Death means nothing. But she didn’t always think that way.” Summary: I did not hate the story but I wasn’t impressed either! The Silent Patient was definitely better. The story is gripping and I enjoyed the fast pacing and writing but the characters and plot were predictable, cliched and did not make sense to me. The whodunit part was very easy to guess but the motive was unpredictable as it was not foreshadowed properly! I still think I am going to give Alex’s next novel a chance but for the time being, I am sticking to the queen herself who inspired those books!
3890846213	Rounded to 3 stars.5 stars for the concept.2 stars for the writing.1 star for that twist (is this a spoiler?).This one did not work for me.It started well. It’s a fast read, but not because it’s engaging. The whole book has only 279 pages (thanks to the page layout, which has plenty of empty spaces) and it’s divided into 6 parts.There are 81 very short chapters. A word count shows 76k.Any depth? No.The dialogues are, in my opinion, very weak. Adding Greek mythology to make this book feel a bit more intellectual did not impress me. Actually, I found the whole thing very (gasp! Don’t hate me!) amateurish.The investigation team is one of the worst ever imagined.I won’t even mention the disappointing twist and the silly conclusion.I’m really having a hard time believing that this book was written by the same author of The Silent Patient.I’m sorry if I’m sounding bitter, but I expected so much more. Anyways… I’m in the minority, so please, don’t mind me.
3934687503	2.5Disappointing with a Capital D. Two quick reasons why this wasn’t nearly as good as I’d hoped it would be when I began. (Loved the premise and locale.)1. Main character came across as unreliable when in fact she just wasn’t believable. I kept waiting for her incongruous choices to make sense— they never did. 2. No real twist the average reader couldn’t spot a mile away. My apologies to the author but I kept waiting for that twist—I guess your first book overshadowed this one and for that I’m truly sorry. You just really nailed it in The Silent Patient!Maybe it was me— I just wasn’t into it. Now I’m going to go read all those reviews I was avoiding because I didn’t want to see any spoilers.(Reviewed 7/12/21)
3785616639	4.5 STARSHollyyyy shit this was so fun. If you love dark academia, Greek mythology, tension that slowly builds, and a cast of murky characters, you’ll love this book. The ending left me flabbergasted and open-mouthed. What a fun time!
3140066127	Everyone's entitled to be the hero of their own story. So I must be permitted to be the hero of mine. Even though I'm not. I'm the villain. Whaaaaaat??? I must echo group therapist Mariana, the main character in Alex Michaelides' sophomore psychological mystery, and ask, "How had I been so blind?" I truly did not guess the ending, perhaps because Alex led me to be super suspicious of EVERYTHING in this story … and then my suspicions turned out to be well founded for reasons I was NOT expecting.This epistolary novel goes backwards and forwards, unveiling tantalizing clues, as the fragile yet somehow sturdy Mariana seeks not to solve the mystery of a serial killer but rather to find a way to bring to justice the killer who looks to get away with it. Her character is kind of lost in the aftermath of the death of her husband, and this case unexpectedly charges her with purpose. That determination and grit is what makes me like her even though there were many times I found myself mentally yelling at her ("no! what are you doing?! you're going to get killed ... and you're killing me!") - I suspect some will find her frustratingly maddening and dreary. None of the other characters were that likable either so don't expect deep character building here.The story is set at Cambridge, where Mariana's niece Zoe is studying under the charismatic (and evil?) teacher of Greek history Edward Fosca. I almost did an exchange program to England when I was in college and now I feel a little like I know what it might have been like. That peek into life at Cambridge alone made this book interesting to me. Also in this Greek tragedy are a bunch of mean girls aka maidens and more romantic interests than I would expect for one morose widow.I read The Maidens in a day, and yes I purposely read it during daylight so as to not freak myself out but as it ends up this suspense seized my attention without horrifying the heck out of me. The short chapters act as a mental luge that speed you to the finish (some might find this lacking in plot points). This isn't for someone seeking a super deep psychological story. It is however a perfect escape from all that is going on in our pandemic world - it couldn't be timed better for the book I'll be recommending if you need a beach read this year (even if you're only going on a mental vacation). P.S. And what delicious Silent Patient Easter eggs (!), even though I must confess I never read The Silent Patient. I suspect that served me well as I read The Maidens with no expectations, preconceptions or comparisons. It's clear that a thread runs through Alex's stories of therapists as the protagonist with an unstable mind as their foil. *digging into my book piles for my copy of The Silent Patient*My honest review is thanks to an advanced copy from Celadon.
4132535955	**Two staff members wrote reviews on this book. Enjoy!** Cora's review: The Maidens (2021) takes reader misdirection and red herrings to a whole new level. And holy Batman, the Greek mythology references!Our protagonist is a group therapist, Mariana Andros. She runs her own practice in London, out of a genuine desire to help others work through their traumas and heal. (view spoiler)[Not unlike our psychotherapist main character from The Silent Patient, Dr. Theo Faber. Although, after the bait-and-switch Michaelides pulled in Silent Patient, I can't say I exactly viewed Mariana as a completely reliable narrator. Maybe well-intentioned in her way, but still. (hide spoiler)]One night, Mariana gets an urgent call from her niece, Zoe, who is away at Cambridge studying Greek tragedy, asking Mariana to please come quick. Zoe doesn't elaborate when Mariana asks what's up, but Mariana's motherly (auntly?) instincts kick in and prompted her to run to Zoe's side. There's been a murder. The victim was her best friend, Tara. It appears to be the work of a deranged individual, but Mariana distrusts the police narrative.Almost immediately, Professor Edward Fosca, Zoe's charismatic Greek tragedy teacher (and academic advisor), seems to insert himself in both the murder investigation and Mariana's life.Something's off, Mariana's instincts are screaming at her. Fosca definitely gives off an air of someone who's used to being in charge, and a vibe of wrongness. He's the king of creeps in a book full of creeps, from Mariana's unbalanced patient, Henry, to Fred, a too nice stranger on the train to Cambridge. Of course, I would be remiss not to include in this list Professor Fosca's star students, a sketchy, culty, female-only inner circle called "The Maidens." The king of creeps' Greek equivalent of the apostles, I guess you could say, willing or unwillingly under the charismatic influence of Fosca. Rumors abound of all the sketchiness they are involved in. (After all, Fosca holds an enormous amount of power over these students especially. Power disparities=vulnerability.)Then, a second Maiden is murdered, Serena, in almost the exact same way as Zoe's friend Tara was. There's a serial killer on the loose, and eventually Mariana's and Zoe's lives are in danger from the killer. "Persephone was rather a vengeful goddess, as I'm sure you know." (view spoiler)[Side note: Persephone was known as "Kore," Greek for "maiden." Hmmmm... (hide spoiler)]Mariana was not emotionally prepared to return to Cambridge, the school where she met her late husband, Sebastian. Sebastian was tragically lost to the stormy sea off the coast of the Greek island of Naxos after a post-run swim. When they were on vacation of all things! (This whole book is basically a modern Greek tragedy, which I think is intentional, to give The Maidens a powerful undertone of magical realism.) She has not finished reckoning with Sebastian's death, let alone her own childhood trauma at the hands of her late cold and authoritarian father (Sound familiar? Also, very ironic.). This colors her investigation of the murders, increasingly convinced that Fosca is the serial killer, and is obsessed with bringing him to justice.Will Mariana get to the bottom of things, before she too is targeted by the killer? Or will she be too late?Read to find out! There is a heck of a twist in this one that I am not going to spoil here. -Cora See also: The Silent Patient (2019) by Alex Michaelides Brandon's review: The Maidens was a book I was looking forward to reading after the awe-inspiring debut of Alex Michaelides with his book, The Silent Patient. The book reads like it was written by a veteran writer full of vivid imagery that puts the reader into the actual scene while feeling the palpable tension and atmosphere of each scene. Most of the mystery/thrillers I have read are usually character driven or plot driven when revealing the story while The Maidens does both. The author delivers a full character background of our main character, Mariana, as well as describing her personality almost completely within the first fifty pages of the book.Mariana is a complex main character where everything about her is exposed to the reader. She had a tough childhood that impacted her into her adult life and was part of the reason why she became a group therapist. Mariana though is not a reliable narrator as we discover that her biases cloud her judgment especially when it comes to the serial killings happening on campus. We later learn that she is also a bit paranoid. The best thing about her though is that she realizes herself that she is too emotionally attached to the case and seeks outside help in navigating everything about the case. Another interesting trait of Mariana is that she might be an empath that also takes part in steering the conclusions she draws. Mariana was well-written but was also frustrating to read with all the aforementioned things since she acted like a dog with a bone and was laser focused on only the person she thought was behind these murders.I loved the short chapter POVs of the unknown character that was mentally unwell with the miserable childhood. I would skim through these chapters a second time looking for some clues that would hopefully eventually lead to the murderer. Sometimes the clues left though were used to intentionally lead to red herrings, and oh boy were they in this book as well as quite a bit of misdirects. It seemed as if the author created different tiers of red herrings on top of random suspects. He created obvious red herrings that would make you second guess yourself sometimes as well as more subtle ones that he purposefully misled the reader into thinking were the killer. The Maidens introduced a large cast where anyone introduced could be a potential suspect with different motives. Alex Michaelides also inserted a lot of Lord Tennyson and other classical literature considering that most of the story took place in Cambridge. Another thing I really liked about this book was the connection it had with The Silent Patient. The main character, Theo, makes a surprise cameo or two that was exciting to read since he is a very different character compared to Mariana. Having already read that book there are some additional easter eggs surrounding him that give insight into the events of The Silent Patient.Even though I really enjoyed this book, I had a few nitpickings with it as well. For one, how did the police miss clues that even our main character could find? Also, how was the existence of the group of students called the maidens surrounding the Professor such a surprise to other characters let alone not questioned by the university in the first place? I even had to look up UK laws regarding drugs since the police just did not seem to be interested in charging a certain suspect or two. I guess the biggest thing for me is that even though I liked the ending it was just so incredulous. I guessed the true culprit and motive correctly for the most part as they were one of the two suspects I originally suspected, but a red herring was clouding my judgment as intended by the author. (view spoiler)[ The reason why the ending was farfetched for me is because the mastermind behind the killings just could not account for everything that could go wrong, and the fact that other characters had no inkling of this person’s true behavior was mind-boggling. Another fact that I can’t wrap my head around is that the person doing the actual killings carried them out contrary to some of the findings at each crime scene since they were revealed to be mentally unhinged. The suspect was supposed to be meticulous and cold with how they cut up the body, but strong and brutal enough that they could do such a deep cut. I thought this character was for sure working with a certain other character right up until the mastermind was revealed to be someone else. (hide spoiler)] In the end, I really enjoyed this book and loved the author’s writing. The mystery and how new suspects were introduced were a delight to read about since they made me think and second guess myself especially the short unknown character’s POV. The added elements from the previous book released by the author enhanced the story of not only this book but The Silent Patient as well. I would love to read another book set in this same universe. I could see a book that follows the character Julian Ashford if we keep following psychotherapists as main characters since we have the whole cast he is working with in the form of the investigator and the medical examiner too. I highly recommend this book to mystery lovers and fans of the author’s first book and look forward to this book maybe getting a chance to be adapted into a movie.Find this book and other titles within our catalog.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
4033208523	Usually I'm not one to jump into a new author because of Best Seller reviews or mega hype, but last year, The Silent Patient caught my attention. After reading and enjoying it, I marked author Alex Michaelides as someone to follow, mostly so I'd know when he published new books. When his second novel, The Maidens, was listed on NetGalley, I requested it... but was denied. So, I ended up getting a copy last week and scheduled it in my reads for this week. Often, a follow-up novel isn't as good as a debut. In this case, I believe Michaelides has outdone himself.Mariana is a ~36ish psychotherapist specializing in group therapy. She's leading a group where one of the members is brutish and potentially dangerous. She was also widowed just over a year ago, and her parents and sibling all died young. She has one family member remaining, Zoe, whom Mariana pseudo raised. When her niece calls about a death on campus, Mariana darts back to her old stomping grounds, despite the memories of Sebastian, her deceased husband. Immediately, I was hooked by the premise of a college campus with strange murders, a macabre and peculiar cast, and the potential of new romance.I couldn't put the book down without grumbling about it. Although there were a few repetitions and slightly confusing moments, for the most part, this was a stand-out read. The descriptions and plight of seeking the truth captivated me, and I remember thinking the same about the author's initial book. It's the kind of read where there's a slow boil, and you think you get everything, but there's a massive surprise that maybe was a bit contrived but still created brilliantly witty and scary scenes. I think Mariana should've guessed what was going on, especially being in the profession she's chosen, but ultimately, maybe she was still reeling from becoming a widow.All the story points are wrapped up nicely, no major holes. There is more than just the mystery of who is stabbing all the girls, and who wants to stop Mariana from finding out the truth. I kept jumping back and forth between the professor who seemed guilty, the new younger man courting Mariana, and the man from her group back home... even though some of the girls seemed guilty too, plus two of the college's administrative staff. Creepy people! It makes me wonder how so many questionable characters can exist, but we all have that side of us... some hidden and controlled more than others. It just takes the right impetus to unearth it.Definitely glad I read it. 4.5 stars, and I will be one of the first to read whatever the author's next book is!
3838388353	My expectations weren't that high after reading many mixed reviews. To me, the story just fell flat... It was so weird to read, but I can't really explain why. I didn't feel like I knew any of the characters, even the main one. Some of them were so strange! Nothing felt natural. I hoped the ending would save the book, but it didn't. What a far-fetched, disappointing ending! The explanations didn't satisfy me at all. I can't say I was bored, it was a quick read, but it left me with... nothing, actually. I can't even say I'm frustrated, because I wasn't engaged in the story enough. I'll have forgotten this book by tomorrow.2.5 stars
3897008206	Interesting, even if contrived a bit. Anyway, just how many evildoers go crazy in a single shreak session?Persephone. Mentioning of her is such a nice angle. Basically, she was a goddess whose departure to the underworld drove her mother to bring winter on Earth and whose coming back signified spring and everything revival. !BEWARE of SPOILERS ahead!Consider how freakishly well this concept is interwoven into the character dev path. At the beginning Mariana is frozen in her grief, she's lost every reason to live and move forward. We are shown how even before that when she still had everything nice in her life (or considered herself to), she's walking a shore and there's this Persephone moment. After it, everything seems to fall apart: Mariana's briefly considering whether she provoked the goddess, maybe made her jealous of her human plight? Then, we've got a plotful of shards of Mariana's life that just wouldn't get back together into one lifetime of happiness. Or even calm. Or serendipity. Or anything apart from paralising pain. We see this plot meandering, Mariana going along with it. The ending, if we pay no attention to the thriller fail, it shows us a new spring, a rebirth of Mariana's life, cleansing from old lies and subconciously felt half-truths. She even gets an unexpected romantic interest. So.... maybe Persephone actually dealt her a winning hand.Q:The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops,And the fierce Poseidon you will never encounter,If you do not carry them within your soul,If your soul does not set them up before you.C. P. Cavafy, ‘Ithaca’Q:Something beautiful, something holy, had died. All that remained were the books he read, the clothes he wore, the things he touched. She could still smell him on them, still taste him on the tip of her tongue. (c)Q:As a young girl, Mariana would sit on the rusty swing in the garden and ponder the ancient city beneath her, sprawling all the way to the columns of the Parthenon on top of another hill in the distance. It seemed so vast, endless; she felt so small and insignificant, and she viewed it with a superstitious foreboding. (c)Q:a baby’s first sense of self comes through its parents’ gazeQ:Even at that age, Mariana was dimly aware that attractiveness had something to do with the internal world: an inner confidence that she lacked.Q:It was an odd feeling, a bit like recognising someone – someone she had once known intimately, and couldn’t quite place where or when they had lost touch. (c)Q:On some level, they became each other – they joined, like mercury. (c)Q:She looked up at the sky. All the stars, invisible in London, shone here so brightly – billions of shimmering diamonds, in an infinite blackness.He must be there, somewhere.‘Sebastian?’ she whispered. ‘Where are you?’She listened and watched, and waited for some kind of sign – for a shooting star, or a cloud passing in front of the moon – something; anything.But there was nothing.Only darkness. (c)Q:I encountered a fox. He hadn’t heard me coming and looked up, startled.It was the closest I’ve ever been to one. What a magnificent creature! – that coat, that tail – and those dark eyes, staring right back at me.I gazed into them and … what did I see?It’s hard to describe – I saw all the wonder of creation, the wonder of the universe, there in that animal’s eyes, in that second. It was like seeing God. And – for a second – I had a strange feeling. A kind of presence. As if God was there, on the street, next to me, holding my hand.I felt safe, suddenly. I felt calm, and at peace – as if a raging fever had abated, a delirium burned itself out. I felt the other part of me, the good part, rising with the dawn … (c)Q:the liminal in Greek tragedy. What does that mean? Well, think of Antigone, pushed to a choice between death and dishonour; or Iphigenia, preparing herself to die for Greece; or Oedipus, deciding to blind himself and wander the highways. The liminal is between two worlds – on the very edge of what it means to be human – where everything is stripped away from you; where you transcend this life, and experience something beyond it. And when the tragedies are working, they give us a glimpse of what that feels like.’ (c)Well, this is one of the finer descriptions of the shrinks' intuition I've ever seen (from the ones that don't cross over into the realm of paranormal)Q:she was a therapist, and she knew how to listen. To listen not only to what was being said, but also to everything unsaid, all the words unspoken – the lies, evasions, projections, transferences, and other psychological phenomena that occurred between two people, and that required a special kind of listening. Mariana had to listen to all the feelings Fosca was unconsciously communicating to her. In a therapeutic context, those feelings were called the transference, and would tell her everything she needed to know about this man, who he was – and what he was hiding. As long as she could keep her own emotions out of it, of course – which wasn’t easy. She tried to listen to her body as they walked, and could feel a rising tension: a tight jaw, teeth clenched into a bite. She felt a burning sensation in her stomach, a prickling in her skin – which she associated with anger. (c)
3735357508	Mariana, a group therapist, receives a frantic call from her niece. Her best friend has been murdered and she needs her to come to the college she attends. Mariana cancels her therapy sessions and travels to Cambridge to help with the investigation. Who is responsible for the brutal murder of such a beautiful young girl? As Mariana conducts her own investigation into the murder, two more girls are murdered. Is a serial killer on the loose? What I liked about this book:It is a super fast-paced read with short chapters, that will have you furiously turning the pages to find out who is the murderer. It takes place in the same universe as The Silent Patient and includes a cleverly placed reference to the characters from that book. Bring on the Greek Mythology! I love the references to the Gods and Goddesses!What didn’t quite work for me:The biggest problem I had with this book is that I didn’t really care for Mariana as the main character. I found her to be unprofessional, gullible, and unqualified as an amateur sleuth. Too many liberties are taken to allow Mariana to investigate the murders herself and this would never happen! She withholds evidence from the police that they missed in their investigation and I don’t believe the professionals would miss such obvious clues. The red herrings were obvious to me and I easily predicted most of the ending. Overall, the ending seemed rather rushed.Is this sophomore thriller as good as the first? No, while the writing easily lures you into the plot, it is not as original as The Silent Patient. However, it is a solid thriller that will keep you guessing until the end. 3.5/5 stars rounded up to 4Thank you to NetGalley and Celadon Books for the ARC of The Maidens by Alex Michaelides in exchange for an honest review.
4132268464	The Maidens is a slow burn mystery with dark academia vibes and Greek mythology references throughout. Mariana Andros is determined to prove that professor Edward Fosca is a murderer. Although the pacing is slow, I was never bored and was engaged from the beginning. I enjoyed the references to The Silent Patient and the eerie, academic atmosphere that was woven into the series of events that lead to a shocking and satisfying conclusion. I was fortunate enough to receive an advanced digital copy along with the audiobook. The narration was perfectly executed and added an extra layer of intrigue and suspense. Thank you Celadon Books and Macmillan Audio for my advance copies. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
3975417239	2.5 stars. As I had to wait for the actual release, I looked through some reviews to live vicariously through those who had finished it. Yes desperate times, but after Silent Patient I was SUPER excited for this. Many of the reviews had noted the slow burn so I had mentally prepared myself for it. But it turned out, ~90% was torturously and painfully slow which only picked up in the last ~10% with a huge twist. I guess my patience had already worn thin at around the 40% mark where not even the great twist could save the book because I was already bored and just wanting to get to the end.PlotThe format is predominantly third person view following Mariana and first person view of a mystery character. I liked the dark mysterious tone and the links of the murders to greek mythology but that's the extent of my interest for the bulk of the book.We are introduced to Mariana, her group therapy job and the tragic loss of her family. Followed soon after by the murder or a maiden, she returns back to Cambridge to support Zoe and investigate, where her suspicions quickly zone in on Edward Fosca. The investigations were basic, straightforward and mostly uneventful, nothing much actually happened and there were no hooks throughout. I found Mariana’s fixation on Edward to be shallow.I think what Michaelides does great is that he presents you with information that is later on very relevant, it builds up and eventually converges to a single event that blows your mind. However, it didn’t have such an effect this time as I had suspected who the killer was and so the twist didn’t have such an impact, though (view spoiler)[Zoe’s relationship with Sebastian was a surprise. I had wondered why we were constantly reminded of Sebastian, as he had already passed away, what relevance did he have throughout? Mariana’s thoughts and memories were a stark contrast to the real Sebastian that we got glimpses of which made this reveal even more unexpected. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[To me it was clear that Edward or the Maidens weren’t the killers. That would have been way too obvious and cliche. What I don’t understand is the maidens’ reaction to the murders, particularly during the group therapy, when it was clear that they were being targeted. They were so casual about it and said that the victims weren’t careful enough. I understand that this was to throw the reader off, but thinking back at this scene and their general reactions, it just doesn’t make sense to me. (hide spoiler)] CharactersThere isn’t much to say about the characters, I didn’t particularly like or dislike any of them. But here is a quick summary and some 1 liners because I don't have much to say as they were quite shallow, Mariana being the most developed. - Although Mariana is a group therapist, I didn’t find her thoughts and insights interesting or complex. Her occupation could have been anything and it still would have worked. - The investigators were depicted as useless. - Henry felt un-necessary and more of a distraction. - I didn’t feel Edward was particularly enigmatic. I didn’t understand Edwards' interest in Mariana and why he kissed her, it just felt random. - All the maidens were the stereotypical shallow, elite, rich kids - Fred's interest in Mariana was also random but he was probably the most likeable oneI thought I would be writing a 5 star review but I think my expectations after Silent Patient were too high.
3779543755	** spoiler alert ** This book was a great read, though the start was a bit slow. I don’t know a lot about Greek mythology so references to Greek tragedies surprised me, especially the horrific paintings. I loved that connection when the author brought Theo from The Silent Patient onto this story. The ending definitely left a cliffhanger vibe that there may be a sequel or maybe it’s up to reader’s interpretation. I’m still unsure if Sebastian’s death was an accident. I wondered if Mariana ended him and then live life in denial like Zoe said. The mystery was well executed.This book started with a prologue where Mariana, 36, a Psychotherapist, believed Edward was a murderer except she couldn’t prove it. It’s been a year since Sebastian’s death, Mariana still loved him and couldn’t bring herself to rid off his belongings. She would have continued mourning for her late husband, Sebastian but a call from Zoe, Mariana’s niece, got her up and going. A body was found near Cambridge University and Zoe believed it’s her roommate Tara. Mariana decided to head out there, a place where she and her husband went to school and dated. She decided to stay a few days to look into Edward, the Professor Zoe said Tara accused before she died. This story was told in Mariana’s POV with an anonymous view every now and then in italicized making readers believed to be the killer. The book was divided into six parts with quotes to start each part. The story ended with an epilogue.The Maidens was a mystery thriller written in references to Greek mythology which took place at Cambridge University. This book, like the author’s debut, both with a main character who’s job was a Therapist, especially one who was flawed growing up. I do liked reading the daddy issues in this book to explain fake parental love. Both point of views were good to read and the ending sure surprised me. It was not clearly written what the dad did behind closed doors to the boy but I am interpreting it as sexual abuse and then he grew up probably doing the same because she admitted that she failed to see. I prefer the author to write it all out than for me to guess, but this book was still a great read and I do recommend it to everyone!xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details Many thanks to Celadon Books for the opportunity to read and review. Please be assured that my opinions are honest.
3797777090	0.5/5Truthfully, I think I came into this book with very low expectations. The first couple of chapters didn't immediately grasp my attention and that really set the tone for the remainder of my reading experience. Mariana is a group therapist and we are first introduced to her during a session in which she is uncomfortable by Henry's advances. Right from this start, I thought Henry would play a significant part in this novel and instead his character really served no purpose. We learn a bit about Mariana's tragic past and how she lost her partner. She gets a call from her niece Zoe, who she took in after her sister passed away. Zoe's close friend was murdered on Mariana's alumna mater campus and Mariana agrees to come and console Zoe. She quickly becomes intertwined into the investigation as more bodies show up. Mariana's prime suspect in this case is professor Edward Fosca who has a secret society called the maidens, which are handpicked brilliant women from his class (Zoe’s friend being a part of this society as well). Despite everyone's favorable opinion of Edward, Mariana enlists the help of another professor (I completely forgot his name due to how forgettable this book is) to prove Edward's guiltiness.The Greek mythology elements of this novel were a massive let down. The story of Persephone and Demeter was constantly alluded to, but I failed to understand the connection. It almost seemed to be too fantastical, instead of deliberately connected. (Hopefully that makes a bit of sense)The characters also felt incredibly flat. Zoe honestly served no purpose for majority of this novel. I don't want to delve into any spoilers, but her relationship with Mariana was so poorly developed it was difficult for me to be interested in Zoe's character. The main thing that I HATED about this novel was how every single man throws themselves at Mariana. There's nothing incredibly remarkable about her. She's pretty timid and reserved so it made me uncomfortable with how insistent some of the men in this novel were about sleeping with her. Overall, the ending was boring. I enjoyed the brief allusion to The Silent Patient, but could not find myself interested in this novel. I was more excited to just finish this and write a rant review than I was for finding out how it ends (and that's the whole point of a thriller novel).∙part of race against time challenge (aka read all 2021 releases before the year ends.)
4381959144	3.5/5no this didn’t as good as the silent patient but that doesn’t mean it isn’t good!i was gripped the whole way but was mainly just irritated by how fixated mariana was on professor and refused to see anything else.i did guess pretty early on who it would end up being but was still shocked at the REASON behind it.another thing that annoyed me a bit was when he kept trying to connect the 2 books via theo, like it really wasn’t necessary.other than those bits, i did enjoy it :)
7967311722	I am freeeeee!!! This book wasn’t completely horrible but, it was so SLOW. Like, a repetitive cycle of the same thing happening until the end when plot twist was revealed.I had really high hopes for this one and I’m sad it was so disappointing but I’m still excited to read other books by this author!
3721878817	I’m of two minds concerning this book. On the one hand, this was one of my most anticipated books of spring to read and it’s always exciting to get a Celadon Arc, because they’re books I put in the top of my tbr. On the other hand, I found this one to be astonishingly predictable. That’s not to say I wasn’t entertained, but it didn’t have the same pull Alex Michaelides previous book, The Silent Patient, did for me either. The author is good at creating a mounting atmosphere of dread as well as making the setting seem quite real, however, some of his characters veered into the realm of caricatures, especially the women, who mostly appear helpless or malicious, not multi-faceted. That being said, I could see this book and The Silent Patient being turned into successful mini-series. So while I didn't love it, I liked it well enough and it more or less delivered what I was looking for in a weekend read. Sometimes you're not looking for something mind blowing, just and easy, entertaining read you can fly through over the course of a couple of days. I'm certainly still interested in reading what Michaelides comes up with next.Thanks to Celadon Books for supplying me with this advance copy in exchange for an honest review!Find my book reviews and more at http://www.princessandpen.com
3891054533	The Maidens is somewhat of a prequel to The Silent Patient. We find out who encouraged Theo to apply at The Grove and how Zoey because one of his patients. Mariana always believed in love.

Believing Sebastian is the love she has been waiting for her whole life. The couple has the perfect life. But they want a baby, well Sebastian does. So they go on a vacation to relax and to try and make a baby. While there, Sebastian goes on a run and doesn’t return. His body is found days later and Mariana is crushed. Years for by and her niece, Zoe,calls her one day fearing her friend is dead. Marianna leaves straight away to help solve the case. While at Zoe‘s university she needs Edward Fosca one of Zoe’s professors. Edward is a hot professor on campus and even has a following of girls in which he calls The Maidens. The Maidens are dying one by one: is Edward Fosca the killer?Honestly I feel like I was duped again. The Silent Patient was not one of my favorite books but it did get better towards the end which is why I gave it four stars. The Maidens is only a three star book. The plot was mediocre, the characters were not relatable, and in the end I should’ve read a different book.
4008416901	Can this new release from Alex Michaelides possibly be as good as The Silent Patient? For me, the answer was an emphatic "You betcha!" I decided to listen to the audio version (kudos to MacMillan Audio and NetGalley for having the narrated version available). The narrators were fantastic. Louise Brealy is a spot on Mariana. And Kobna Holdbrook-Smith will give you goosebumps as the unknown man with the sinister diary. Michaelides combines Greek mythology with Shakespeare and 'The Duchess of Malfi' to give us a simmering stew of suspense, revenge, and regret. There is crossover action with characters from The Silent Patient cranking up the creep factor for fans of that book without excluding those who have not read it. The beauty of it is that you can read the two in any order and still love the connection. I hope the next title gives us more connections! Both are highly recommended.Thank you to MacMillan Audio and NetGalley for providing an audio ARC in exchange for an honest review.
