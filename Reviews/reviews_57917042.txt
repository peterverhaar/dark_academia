4157074343	Wow! Just wow! That’s so much than I expected: Alienist meets Frankenstein with Scottish romance vibes, hot love sessions and forbidden kisses at the graveyard! Yeap! Quirky, disturbing but also surprising, stimulating, intelligent! A great concoction for gothic thriller lovers who adore tough, bold, smart heroines! Welcome to the 19th century of Scotland: where the plague erupted and womanhood was the biggest obstacle to choose medicine as profession. Poor Hazel Sinnett lives in a secluded, gothic family mansion, electrifying frogs for testing her peculiar medical methods behind the locked doors as her mother still mourns after her dead brother George and her little brother Percy stays in the middle of this chaos, behaving like most irritating spoiler kid. Hazel might be only 16 but she’s so determined to pursue her career in medicine in expanse of being disguised in her dead brother’s clothes, acting like a man to be accepted to the coursework. The entire city of Edinburgh is getting through the most demanding and struggling times as the plague threat arises and the resurrection men who are the gravediggers for providing more dead bodies to the anatomists and surgeons to resume their researches against the deadly effects of fever and contagious disease. Jack Currer is one of the resurrection men, taking risks to dig out more graves as the dangerous men lurk around the graveyards to hunt them. His path crosses with the ambitious, vivid, reckless Hazel and they reluctantly turn into partner in crimes and the danger of the job, staying alive against terminal disease make them vulnerable. As sparks fly around them, they do everything to concentrate on their jobs. But as you may see: The intimate romance blossoms at most inappropriate places ( yes this book could be defined as graveyard romance! Isn’t it a fabulous new genre idea? ) Hazel takes the responsibility to be a doctor too hard, dealing with her capricious almost fiancée, barely resisting her feelings for Jack! I went back and forth between giving this mind blowing story four and five stars but that WTH, OMG I’m screaming at the top of my lungs ending was game changer! I’m rounding up 4.5 stars to 5 dark, haunted, gory, thrilling, deadly, creepy, unputdownable stars! Special thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press/ Wednesday Books for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.

Someone should tell you you're beautiful on Christmas Day and Christmas Eve and the evening before Christmas Eve, and on Easter. He should tell you on Guy Fawkes Night and on New Year's, and on the eighth of August, just because."I believe a good numbers of readers would pick up Anatomy: A Love Story based on the gorgeous cover art alone, because, contrary to popular belief, we really do grab our first impressions by judging a book by its cover. The marketing of this one might throw some people, as it's proclaiming to be a romantic, historical fantasy, but my finding was it really gears more in the way of historical fiction with a light side of the fantastical and just a dash of secondary romance. This isn't a complaint, just simply an observation to ensure you're in the right frame of expectation before choosing this book as your next read. If a slow burning, gothic style "mystery" is your thing, please proceed with gusto.Hazel Sinnett is a 17 year old lady of "good breeding" living in Scotland in the early 1800's. She has a passion for becoming a physician/surgeon, and is hounded by the prospect of being required to marry her cousin, the viscount's son of Almont. 🤢 Although this was common back in the day, it's still yuck. After sneaking into a surgical presentation one afternoon, Hazel decides the best course of action is to pose as her deceased brother George and pass her physician exams so that she can find a place in this world to practice medicine. There is a disease going around called the Roman Fever, and she hopes to find a cure for it. Along the way, she meets Jack Currer, who is a "resurrection man", or someone who robs graves to sell the recently buried bodies to those needing to practice surgical techniques. Meanwhile, someone is kidnapping the poor, knocking them unconscious, and practicing on them against their will, sometimes leading to the deaths of these unlucky individuals. The first half of the book is really meant to set the tone and atmosphere, while introducing a number of characters. It is a slow burn up until about the 60% mark, which was not a problem for me, but I was a little disappointed that all the twists were easily guessed from the earlier portions of the novel. That said, there was something truly readable about this story, and I found myself thinking about it and looking forward to picking it back up when I was doing other things, so that has to count for something. Whether it was the gothic vibe or the tangible Scottish atmosphere, it caused me to rate the story one star higher than anticipated. Fair warning: the ending is a bit abrupt, and while it's not exactly left open-ended, it didn't feel as complete as I'd hoped, but perhaps there will be a sequel? Regardless, this was a quick read that pulled me out of my slump, so bravo!*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.
4600449614	aw, man. such a captivating story that has a massive flop of an ending. :/and i was having so much fun with this, too. its very ‘stalking jack the ripper’ and ‘a ladys guide to petticoats and piracy,’ with the supernatural elements reminding me more of ‘a golden fury.’ if you love a strong female character who isnt going to let the world of men get in the way of doing what she wants mixed with a historical setting, then this is a book you will want to pick up. also, i want to make it clear that the love story referenced in the title is not a romantic love, but hazels love for medicine and passion for her subject. yes, there is a romantic love interest, but it is so minor that i think readers will feel duped if they go into this expecting romance. but its a short and sweet story that delivers on fast pacing, purposeful plot, and interesting characters. so its such a shame the ending was such a let down for me. thank goodness it didnt ruin my reading experience completely. ↠ 3.5 stars
4519217587	People say if you look for gothic romance in the urban dictionary, you'll see it as racconfables' favorite leisure genre and so you have no idea how I'm champing at the bit when this book first come out. Ressurection men? Anatomist? With the beautiful cover heart-shaped as similitude? And ROMANCE??? Signed me tf up ✅ "Dead bodies are never going to bite you. They're never going to do anything to you. It's the living things that hurt you" To be a surgeon in the 1800s when you are bestowed with womanhood is not attainable. Even so, Hazel's interest in science, particularly its applications to medicine, did not deter her from sneaking into a lecture on medicine that women were not permitted to attend. On the other side, Jack makes ends meet while working odd jobs as a resurrection man to sell for medical research. Unbeknownst to them, Hazel and Jack crossed paths when he helps her into a medical presentation discreetly; knowing that if her cover is blown off, it could spell disaster for her, including those around her. However, Edinburgh is undergoing a sinister calamity as Jack's acquaintances have lost other resurrectionists; and grave digging is becoming an increasingly dangerous profession. Even if their disparity in the social standing would appear to be irreconcilable, Hazel starts accompanying Jack on his work in the cemeteries despite the danger. As they spend more time together, they grow closer and more comfortable, which promises something more. First of all, the book starts wonderfully because I am immersed, hooked, and I love Schwartz's groundwork on the post as well as the society at the time. This novel is pleasantly warm considering its gothic nature with plenty of gore. The plot is embraced by the history of surgery and the Sweeney Todd vibe is both eerie and enchanting. It was fascinating to watch Hazel delve into the terrifying realm of the unknown and the darker side of humanity through the sublime. Anatomy could be quite a masterpiece. It is unputdownable and I devour it like a starving man. Now give me the drumroll for the big BUT that is coming in, because is there some figurative meaning that I should pick up after reading this? I get that this serves as a sort of Frankenstein kind of book, but I was in a funk with the last three chapters of the story. While this book has a ton of potential, the initial impressions don't withstand.Quite frankly, despite the romance alluded to in the title, you shouldn't expect a typical love story from it— boohoo that wasn't the case when I started it as the romance was downplayed. The real love interest seemed to be more apparent between Hazel and anatomy/surgery. I mean, there was a fair amount of romance in this book and there was chemistry between Hazel and Jack; granted the buildup to some kissing (not digging the kiss in the grave though), but it never felt like a full-blown romance. Well, surely no big deal though. But you know how they said 'one bad thing blinds a thousand good ones?'. Well, that is kind of exactly how it goes for me. Although I initially liked Hazel, the way her frantic studying was unexpectedly replaced with her involvement in a mystery involving missing people was a little strange. It was difficult to fathom Hazel's obstinacy and why she was so bent on being a surgeon. Then, there seem to be a lot of loopholes in the plot and the fantastical elements were unanticipated — it was presented so close to the end of the narrative that they felt forced and unwarranted, I don't think it works on me. I may be mean for saying this, but then I am always unequivocal so you cannot convince me that this is not Stalking Jack the Ripper Walmart version - from the autonomist, corpse, the mystery, the whole Frankenstein fiasco. So again, some authors need to know when to insert anti-climatic as a plot device. There was no buildup as to how the culprit was discovered, and it went sour. No actual conclusion and only loose ends.At length, this does not take away that the beginning of the book was magical, but the one-dimensional aspects to it may not exactly steal readers' hearts as the book cover may appear to. It hinted at a sequel but do I still wanna be part of it? To be continued...
4552553509	18/02 Update: I've changed my rating from 1 to 2 stars because someone pointed out that there is a difference between love story and romance. I didnt realise a love story can have very light element of love/romance only so I guess that would have managed my expectations a bit. But either way I still think that the relationship development in this was too light for my liking.Rating ⭐ This could probably be a 2.5 or 3 star but because of the ending and my false expectations that have left me disappointed this is a 1 star.~ Quick Summary ~Set in Edinburgh 1817, this is a love story between Hazel and her passion of becoming a surgeon, despite society expecting her to get married. ~ Pick this up if you enjoy/don’t mind the following ~📜Mostly a YA Historical fiction 👦 Gender Bender 💖Light romance on the side, develops very quickly and in the second half only. If you are looking for a romance - I would not recommend this. 🐢Slow pace🔍Mystery on the side ~ What I Enjoyed ~The writing was good, setting and world building was on point, but sadly that's not enough to save this book. ~ What I didn’t enjoy ~1) I had so many false expectations coming into this. It's not funny. - Considering that “love story” is in the title I expected a lot more romance. Instead, Jack and Hazel meet briefly in the first 20/30% mark and long after I’ve forgotten that I was expecting a romance, they finally had more scenes past the 50% mark but their relationship developed very quickly. - In the blurb, it mentions “A gothic tale full of mystery…”. Again, this gave me false expectations because this was predominantly a historical fiction with mystery on the side that developed more in the second half. In fact, even the romance was on the side. Wow. The more I’m typing this review the more frustrated I feel. 2) The whole book was all telling and not enough showing, so many things that are mentioned in the blurb were brief and not explored enough. For example: - Hazel’s time in the classroom and pretending to be a boy, I could tell you that one line and that's all you need to know. Not much happened as she excelled in her class and disguised herself easily. - Converting her home into a makeshift hospital seemed easy enough. I did enjoy these parts but she sure did go from zero to hero instantly. - Her relationship with Jack (I still don’t know why this is called a love story). - Jack’s job of being a resurrection man and helping Hazel. From the blurb it seemed like this would be a pretty significant part of the novel. If anything Hazel’s experience at her makeshift hospital was more significant in learning than Jack providing Hazel with bodies. - The disappearances. I was never curious about them. At all. - There was no major character development, everyone stayed more or less the same (though not always a bad thing).What was explored in detail was Hazel’s passion for being a surgeon, her barriers to become one and her reluctance to marry. This isn’t a bad thing but again I came into this with the wrong expectations which really annoys me. 3) Other random thoughts: - I listened to this on Audible and I found myself losing focus a lot especially when we are only in Hazel’s head. It's filled with a lot of descriptions. - The twist was so left field it reminded me of (view spoiler)[Behind Her Eyes (hide spoiler)]. Not exactly what I signed up for. Though perhaps it's my fault for not noticing all the genres listed on goodreads

She’s betrothed to her cousin and made to conform to the position of young woman in high society. Reading manuals on human physiology, bringing dead frogs back from the dead, and disguising herself as a boy to attend classes at an all-boys physiology school, Hazel was determined to be a physician regardless of her sex.But there was a lot more happening in this book than just her pursuit in science.

The prose is to the point, nothing over the top but very satisfying. I couldn't help but get Bronte and Mary Shelley vibes. I loved that this story had so many aspects that wrapped itself together into one bigger story. I loved the mysterious aspects of the story and brought a little bit of suspense to it. I was wondering who might be the person who was causing all the deaths and the reveal was so satisfying. I won’t elaborate on that because of spoilers, but omg I LOVE the whole vibe! Especially around autumn, it gives a gloomy/gothic vibe. Love Hazel, she's a total badass... “I’m not a fool, Jack Currer, no matter how you might think of me.”“Oh, I assure, Miss Sinnett, I’ve taken you for a lot of things, but a fool was never one of them.”The tale between Jack and Hazel warmed my heart. I appreciated the way in which their love grew. There is something to a medically cold story that is set with romantic undertones. Dana Schwartz did a fantastic job of intertwining the two concepts into one historical tale totally worth reading.“My heart is yours, Hazel Sinnet. Forever. Beating or still.”⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀:¨ ·.· ¨:⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ `· . ꔫ
4392948663	Gothic mystery with grave-robbing resurrectionists, dark magic, Victorian operating theaters and strong female leads set in Scotland? YES, PLEASE.My only criticism is that it ended a bit abruptly, but I'm hoping that's because there will be more books to come.
4446851624	"A gothic tale full of mystery and romance," you say? Well. It certainly has a pretty cover. Really, I've got to hand it to the marketing folks involved in this: for a book that doesn't even come close to "Gothic," barely contains much of a mystery at all, and has one of the most sudden and consequently lifeless romances I've ever read, they sure did a good job making me think this was something I'd like."Historical wallpaper" is how I usually describe books that place characters with modern sensibilities into historic settings. It's when an author wants to use the historic locations, clothing, technology, language, and social constructs to play around in, but isn't really interested in sticking to a more constrained historicity. This works for a lot of very fun books! It does not work here, because this is barely even historical wallpaper. These are thoroughly modern characters dressed in costumes, playing around in front of a canvas theater backdrop of 19th century Edinburgh, with some dead bodies thrown in for funsies. (Also, there is some particularly gruesome stuff involving eyeballs, so be on the lookout for that if you're skeeved out by that like I am.)It's 1817 and we've got our teenage MC, Hazel, who is apparently gently bred enough to live in a castle but not gently bred enough to know that women weren't particularly being hired as physicians or surgeons in that time period. And no, this isn't a case of Strong Willed Young Woman Wants to Prove That We Girls Can Do Anything, Right Barbie? She is on several occasions absolutely stunned when anyone points out that she's female and isn't going to just be able to waltz into a class and learn human anatomy, let alone practice. There's a whole other bit later where she's absolutely flummoxed by the thought that a husband could have any say over whether a woman practices medicine after her marriage. Because, you know, women in that time and place were absolutely their own people and definitely not their husband's property. This makes Hazel come off as a something of an idiot, completely unaware of the strictures of her society. (She's also mean. She makes fun of a bully for having moles on his face and then does a handful of other things that made me think "what a dick" on several occasions.)I don't even want to get into Jack, our extremely bland love interest. Dude steals bodies and has a crush on a ballerina and.... that's about it. Fun fact: there's an entire chapter about him in which nothing happens and the story absolutely does not move forward at all! In fact, there may be more than one chapter like that; I genuinely can't remember because he is so dull.Anyway, Hazel gets left alone in her castle without any chaperone because sure, okay. And then the entirety of the book passes and nothing happens. I looked down at 20%, astounded that I was already that much into the book and that not much had happened. At 55%, I almost gave up because, again, nothing had happened. When things suddenly swung into motion, when the so-called mystery finally reared its head, I was at 75%. The pacing of that final 25% gave me whiplash compared to the first 75%, leaving me wondering just what the heck I'd read.There are a million little things that annoyed me, like how no one in the upper classes speaks very differently from those in the lower ("sick" meant vomit then, right? Because it's used here in our modern parlance but I felt "ill" or "unwell" or "indisposed" would have helped center the story in the time period.). You've got a (view spoiler)[police constable who snorts in contempt at and talks down to our socially-higher-ranked Hazel, someone who could get him fired for such impertinence (hide spoiler)] (if Hazel wasn't such an egalitarian 21st century girl in Regency clothing). Why is a pregnant woman (view spoiler)[walking a half hour for help with childbirth when surely a ton of midwives must have been available in the city proper and maids from different houses spoke to one another so she surely must have known SOMEONE that could point her in the right direction (hide spoiler)]? Why does no one care that (view spoiler)[a teenager is performing medical care alone at her home (hide spoiler)]? Word must have gotten out, otherwise (view spoiler)[there would be no patients, yes (hide spoiler)]? What in the world is romantic about (view spoiler)[yanking a mutilated corpse out of a grave and hiding for your lives, and then kissing and.... falling asleep? In an empty grave? With a--again--horrifically mutilated corpse not six feet from where you are (hide spoiler)]?So yeah, the mystery is.... woof. Something else, I tell you. I mean, completely telegraphed but still, it's a doozy, and you don't really even get much time to sit with it because the book that up until this point has been trickling like molasses is suddenly going Mach 5. The romance is so poorly done that I'm still vaguely baffled by it.This had a great premise and, again, well done to the marketing folks. Too bad the execution failed so disappointingly.
4671282331	2023Reread this to refresh myself before starting Immortality, the second and final book.I enjoy this so much for a YA romance. Like I said last year, the romance is good but the characters themselves and the setting is really what shines. Edinburgh has a rich, deep, and disturbing history that Dana Schwartz nails in a similarly gruesome but also whimsical way.I didn't love this AS much the second time around simply because it was the shock of enjoying a YA novel that made this so highly rated the first time around. I'm going to keep this at a 4 however because I hope other people pick this duology up. It's very under rated and I hope the YA audience gets their hands on this.2022I am not normally someone who enjoys YA to this extent but WOW. This was right up my street.It is a love story but the main appeal is the plot and the atmosphere. The author's note at the end added so much depth and intrigue to the book. The fact that almost everything she's mentioned in surgical horrors was REAL and is memorialized in Ediburgh's Surgery of Horror's Museum is bonkers. I love the tie in to the true crime but putting a fantasy twist on it.This is macabre and gothic but also lovely and has so much feminism and respect at it's core. I really really really enjoyed this.
5134750079	2.5 stars MAX This was boring. I had to fight my way through this book because little to nothing happened in the beginning. I was really intrigued by the cover and the overall “mystery stalking Jack the Ripper, zombie, Frankenstein” vibes but I feel like so many unnecessary things happened that made it way too long and boring. Honestly I thought this was going to be a stand-alone and I wish it was because the ending was too magical for me.Don’t get me wrong I loved the entire idea of a woman being very determined to become a doctor during this time but the side plots were not that fun and the romance dead. Literally. How did we get to making out so quickly? And why was there so much drama in the theatre???
6312103899	4.45/5 ⭐Frankenstein meets Marie Curie and a little bit of Jack the Ripper in 1800s Scotland and if you love the sound of that then you're about to have the best time with this. Anatomy has on one side a Jane Austen narrative vibe and on the other side, it feels like Mary Wollstonecraft also wanted to be part of the construction of the narrative and if these two had a baby in the form of YA historical fiction then this would probably be it.The atmosphere of the book is amazing, it's honestly a Stalking Jack the Ripper but a little bit better executed in my humble opinion. It's grey and cold and rainy and it has some sort of toughness about it, but one that is enjoyable and leaves you wanting more of it.The characters are sometimes silly, sometimes sweet, some of them are deserving of a serious caning (sorry, I feel violent today) and some others just need protection at all costs. I am seriously surprised that I've been sleeping on this for so long because even though I don't consider it a masterpiece of the genre, it kept me wanting to read and learn more, I was entertained and I liked the way the whole narrative vibe was making me feel throughout the story. And the fact that, if you go a little bit deeper than the surface, you will most definitely see a note on what does it mean to be a woman aspiring to do something in a field that, up until a certain point, has been male-dominated. Because even though everyone can see how talented and determined Hazel is to become a female surgeon, all the people in her chosen field seem to be against her. Marriage and motherhood are the best careers for a woman, but Hazel chooses not to be the generic woman and become her own being. Which is in fact a very nice idea that I love and respect.
5283126983	Edinburgh im Jahr 1817. Hazel möchte Chirurgin werden; als Frau für sie unmöglich. Doch als Junge verkleidet schleicht sie sich in den Lehrsaal und kann so bei ein paar Stunden Medizin dabeisein. Irgendwann wird sie aber doch entdeckt und der Universität verwiesen. Doch es gibt noch eine Chance: Wenn Hazel ohne Unterricht die medizinische Prüfung besteht, ist ein Dozent bereit, sie bei ihm studieren zu lassen.Hazel gelingt es mit der Hilfe von Jack, einem "Auferstehungsmann", an frische Leichen zu kommen, um sie zu sezieren und so zu lernen.🖤Mein Leseeindruck:Ein wirklich guter erster Band, der mich sehr fesseln konnte! Ich mochte die Atmosphäre, die dieses Buch durchzieht. Man taucht als Leser ab in eine ganz neue, fremdartige Welt, die doch eigentlich gar nicht so fremd ist.Ich fand es aber faszinierend, mit Hazel gemeinsam mehr über die Welt der Medizin zu erfahren. Ein Thema, das mich sowieso sehr interessiert.Es gibt auch Krimi-Elemente in diesem Buch; auch das hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Die Stimmung war immer ein bisschen düster und beklemmend, aber auf eine gute Art.Die Liebesgeschichte, die es hier auch gibt, habe ich als eher hintergründig wahrgenommen. Gerade deshalb hat sie mir so gut gefallen. Alles andere hätte für mich nicht so zur Stimmung des Buches gepasst.Zum Ende des Bandes gibt es dann auch noch einen Hauch Fantasy. Den hätte ich nun hier nicht haben müssen, aber trotzdem bin ich gespannt auf den zweiten Band und freue mich darauf!
5514046312	A fun young adult women-in-STEM, lightly-feminist historical romance! So many things to love in this easy-to-read love story of a girl who just wants to be a doctor and a boy from the wrong side of the carriage tracks. More 'Women In Stem' novels here! THOUGHTS: - Anatomy is a super fast-paced read, and I enjoy reading something young adult every now and then as a palette cleanser before heavier, more emotional reads. Schwartz's writing is also incredibly fluid, so you can read this one in a few days! - Our heroine, Hazel - progresses from an immature young girl with fanciful ideas to a woman with her eyes open to the world is one of those things you know is about to happen but something you're also happy to see for any young gal. She learns the realities of life aren't as easy, and I appreciate that things weren't sugar-coated even though she was wealthy! Her future had been mapped out since birth, but in choosing her own way, she would also have to face harsh realities in life. - Somewhat disturbing to think about the fact that early medicine and medical studies relied on cadavers that were already rotting. It's a wonder any medical advancements have been made! Will I Read The Next Book? At some point, I could see myself reading the next book if I want something truly mindless.. however I feel that after reading the book blurb for Immortality (Book #2) - I already know the ending? With such a massive TBR list, sometimes I feel it's important, to be honest with myself about what I want to add to my TBR so I don't get bogged down. However, if I saw a copy of this book sitting at Half Priced Books - I'd probably snag it to have the duology complete in the library. FAVORITE QUOTES: (Had A LOT of favorite quotes from this book because it's so good and I feel like a great teaching tool in some ways?) - "never rely on someone with less to lose than you did." - Street smarts in the making for our young readers. - "Hazel, there's no hell worse than a world in which I would see you grow old and lose you and then be forced to live another day." - Sweet in a Poe sort of maudlin way.NOTES: - Truly young adult in how the character's relationships are portrayed for their younger than 18-year-old selves.- CWs: Parts of this story are somewhat gruesome.. think about what doctors do in med school while they're practicing on cadavers..? Definitely, some parts that I had to skip through because they grossed me out, but nothing else, IMO can be considered a content warning for readers.- P.S. I thought this was going to be a fantasy novel for some reason - and even though it's not - there is a bit of scientific magic/whimsy that readers can look forward to.
4539002987	While Davey tugged the rope, Munro, still in the grave, helped to guide the body out of the small hole in the coffin and back toward the surface world, a strange reverse birth for a body past death. Munro successfully removed the body’s shoes off as it left its coffin, but it was up to Davey to strip off the rest of its clothes and throw them back in the grave. Stealing a body was against the law, but if they actually took any property from the grave, that would make it a felony. -------------------------------------- It’s the lesson young girls everywhere were taught their entire lives—don’t be seduced by the men you meet, protect your virtue—until, of course, their entire lives depended on, seduction by the right man. It was an impossible situation, a trick of society as a whole: force women to live at the mercy of whichever man wants them but shame them for anything they might do to get a man to want them. Passivity was the ultimate virtue…Be patient, be silent, be beautiful and untouched as an orchid, and then and only then will your reward come: a bell jar to keep you safe. Ok, so I screwed up. First off, I thought the pub date was 2/22/22 and scheduled my reading and review accordingly. Uh, sorry. Actual pub date was 1/18/22, so I am coming at this one a bit late. Second, I did not do a very thorough job of reading about the book when it was offered. I somehow managed to overlook the fact that it is a YA novel. I have nothing against YA novels. Some of my favorite books are YA novels, but I usually pass on YA books these days unless there is a compelling reason to take them on. Had I seen that it was a YA, I would probably have skipped this one. Finally, yet another failing on my part. I somehow managed to overlook the romance element in the promotional copy. Again, I have nothing against romance elements in books which are mostly of another sort. Quite enjoy them when they are well done. But did not have my expectations primed for the presence of quite as much as there is here, which is not to say that it is huge. It is not. So, multiple failings, mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. The product of impatience. Won’t happen again. I know the drill, Three Hail Marys and a couple of Our Fathers. Now that I’ve gotten that off my chest ands offered fair warning…on to the book itself. Dana Schwartz - image from her site Hazel Sinnett is seventeen. She has always lived in a castle an hour outside Edinburgh. It is 1817. She very much wants to study medicine, has read all the books in the family library on the subject, but lacks actual school-based tuition and hands-on experience. When the grandson of a famous doctor is in town to deliver a lecture, she finds a way to attend. Gender attitudes being what they were at the time, people of her sort were not welcome. Still, she finds a way, with some help, and when the doctor announces he will be offering an anatomy class she is desperate to attend.Medicine is making some advances but the study of the human body requires actual human bodies, preferably lately late. Executions not providing sufficient resources to fill the need, a profession has arisen to satisfy that demand, resurrectionists, who, for a fee, relieve nearby graves of their residents, and deliver same to their clients with the utmost of discretion. Jack Currer, also seventeen, counts that among his several jobs. He happens to be hanging about near the Anatomists’ Society when Hazel is locked out. Meet Cute as Jack shows this clearly well-to-do young lady a secret way in. Think these two might just cross paths again? Of course, there are impediments.Hazel is not in line to inherit anything, regardless of her parents’ wealth, bypassed in favor of the male heir. The female thing again. The usual way for a young lady from a god family to secure a future is to secure a husband of means. As it happens, she has a first cousin living not too far away, Bernard. They have known reach other forever, played together since early childhood, and it has been presumed that it was only a matter of time before Bernard would propose. He is not a bad sort, but rather dull and a bit too concerned with his appearance. Hazel recognizes that there are problems with her being allowed to make her own way in the world, so more or less anesthetizes herself to the likelihood that Bernard is her likeliest way out of a life of penury. God knows that is what her mother keeps telling her, and telling her, and telling her. She manages to attend some of Doctor Beecham’s lectures, and is the star pupil, but the female thing again. Guys, catch up, C’Mon! Beecham at least recognizes her intelligence and they come to an agreement. If she can pass the medical exam at the end of the term, she will be able to get real medical training. Unfortunately, there’s that hands-on thing. Books alone will simply not do. But wait! It just so happens she has made the acquaintance of someone who might be able to help her out, and a beautiful friendship blossoms. I really thought I was going to go be a doctor,” Dana Schwartz says about her time as a pre-med student in college. “Then I had this panicked moment of realizing I was so fundamentally unhappy. My dream was always to be a writer, but I never thought I could make a living that way.” - from the Forbes interviewBut it is not all raw sexism and Hallmark moments. There are dark doings in Edinburgh. A plague has struck, a return of the so-called “Roman fever” which had killed over five thousand the last time it hit, two years before. It had even killed Hazel’s beloved brother, George. She had caught it as well, but managed to survive. Is it really Roman Fever that is boosting the mortality rate? Jack is aware of far too many acquaintances vanishing, and there are strange doings in the local graveyards as a trio of heavies are haunting such areas, terrorizing the poor resurrection men. Then Hazel begins to see some very strange medical problems when she starts getting to study specimens obtained by Jack, and treating some locals. There is also something decidedly off about Doctor Beecham, who never seems to remove his dark gloves, and demonstrates a mind-numbing drug as a road to pain-free surgery. Then there is Doctor Straine, one eye, nasty skin and a worse attitude, a surgeon working with Doctor Beecham. Seems like a nogoodnik from the build-a-creep shop.It was the gothic elements that had drawn me to the story. And they are indeed present. But Schwartz has had some fun with them. (For the following I used some of a list from Elif Notes.) Usually gothic novels feature a Desolate, haunted Setting, typically a very creepy castle or equivalent. Here, Hazel lives in a castle, which is a pretty benign home for her. Other sites must serve this purpose. Graveyards work, and certainly provide some chills, and any place where human bodies are being cut up, for purposes educational or malign, will also serve, so, check. Dark and Mysterious Atmosphere? You betcha, plenty of suspect characters and unexplained deaths and disappearances. Something supernatural? Well, I do not want to give anything away, so will say only that there is an element here that qualifies the story as fantasy. Emotional Extremes? Fuh shoo-uh. Although the emotional extremes are as much about Hazel’s lot in life as they are about the actual life-and-death shenanigans that are going on. Women as Victims - absolutely, but in the wider, sexism-conscious sense as well as in the way of a damsels being put upon by dastardly males. Curses and Portents - not so much, except what we all might wish upon some of the baddies. Visions and Nightmares - Hazel has some of the latter, but nothing mystical about them, just recollections of horrors she had seen in real life. Frightening Tone - most definitely. There is clearly something sinister going on in Edinburgh. Frightening Weather - not really. There is a fun early bit in which we are waiting for an incoming storm to deliver some life-generating lightning, but mostly, weather is not that big a deal here. Religious Concerns - social mores are more the thing in this one. Good versus Evil - there is some serious evil going on here. And Hazel is definitely a force for good. A Touch of Romance - yes. Well, more than a touch. Hey, Laddy, you’d better keep those hands to yersel ef ya wan ter keep ‘em on the ends uh yer arms.”There is Romance and then there is Love. The title even highlights it, Anatomy: A Love Story. There is clearly some romance going on here. Hazel and Jack give off sparks which brings their obvious connection to life. But Hazel’s true love may be more the passion she has for learning, for science, for medicine, for anatomy, for surgery. If she were really faced with a choice between being a doctor or being with Jack, and the two were exclusive, are you confident what choice she would make? Is it possible to have your cake and dissect it too? Not so easy in 1817 Scotland. The real horrors here are the treatment of women as a subordinate level of human and the joys of the class system in early 19th Century Scotland. Even coming from a family of means, Hazel is refused entry into a profession for which she has passion, and a clear capability, simply because of her gender. She must endure belittling by men, in power and not, who are her intellectual and moral inferiors, as she struggles to find a way forward. Contemplating her life options, Hazel sees her future as a life under a bell jar, whatever that may be referring to. The experience of being poor in the Georgian era is shown not only in the life of Jack, but in the ways the poor and working class are held in their place no less than if they were confined to a castle dungeon, and in the depraved indifference the wealthy show to the lives of those less fortunate than themselves. “The main mystery I wanted to pick at and unravel is who gets forgotten in society and for what purpose,” Schwartz says. “Obviously today, there is a huge wealth gap that continues to grow, but in the 1800s, the aristocracy made that wealth gap explicit. There was a social and cultural line, so I wanted to explore in a way that doesn’t necessarily label the characters as heroes or villains.” - from the San Diego Tribune interviewThere are some comedic elements, one of which focuses on a man-eater and is hilarious. There a lovely bit of a secondary romantic sub plot, and some fun references. Hazel is all excited to hear about a lecture/demonstration put on by someone named Galvini. This is a clear reference to the actual Luigi Galvani who was putting on shows in which dead things were animated with electricity from a battery. He provided some of the inspiration for a young writer of that era. The epigraph of the novel is a quote from Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, whose creation has near universal familiarity. A mention of Mary Wollstonecraft, her mom, serves double duty as a reference to a leading light for women’s rights in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and as a reminder that the novel deals with matters of life and death, and maybe life again. Hazel’s younger brother is named Percy, which again reminds one of Mary Shelley. A recollection of Walter Scott reciting his Lady of the Lake epic at her Uncle and Aunt’s house is also reminiscent of the Wollstonecraft/Godwin household, in which Coleridge read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner. So, there are many Frankensteinian parts gathered together to help animate the story.Some parts did not quite fit, however. It was sooo convenient that her father was away on a prolonged naval mission, and that Mum decides to head out of town for an extended period with her other, much more valuable, male child, Hazel’s younger brother. So, Risky Business time for the entire season at Hawthornden Castle. (Although maybe Summer at Bernie’s might be a bit closer, given the issues with dead people.) AND, really? none of the staff rats Hazel out to her mother, the one paying their salary, for running a clinic at the family residence? Maybe we should consider this part of the fantasy element. Re my intro, I was not much excited by the squishy romance bits, but I already told you about that. No biggie, ultimately. It is mostly adorable. Dana Schwartz has written a strong, literary, YA novel that offers some chills, an historical look at a place and time, and a look at the challenges faced by the poor and by those of the female persuasion, when it was still the rule to treat women as servants, eye candy, or brood mares. It shows a powerful approach and makes me eager to see what she comes up with when she writes a full-on adult novel, but that may not be next up on her board. …right now, I have an idea for a sequel that I really want to tell and I think will be really fun. I thought this was going to be a one-off, but when I reached the ending, and I sat with that for a few months, I thought that there’s something else here.” - from the San Diego Tribune interviewReview posted – February 11, 2022Publication date – January 18, 2022I received an ARE of Anatomy: A Love Story from Wednesday Books in return for a fair review and some help dealing with an uncomfortable neck growth.

5990670483	I’m on BookTube now! =)”He could see the thin arc of her pale lips, the freckles almost invisible on her cheeks. Her face was burned into his memory, and it remained there: an echo but undiminished. A haunting.”How is it this book has lines like this one and still isn’t all too popular among my fellow reviewers?! Of course I can only speak for myself here but “Anatomy: A Love Story” was such a surprise and this in the best way possible! When I first heard of the book I thought it might be a romance that plays in Edinburgh in the year 1817 and it sounded interesting enough to pick it up when I found it at my library. Well, and then I read the blurb and my perception of the book changed and I got even more intrigued. ”What were miracles, but science that man didn’t yet understand? And didn’t that make it all the more miraculous that the secrets of the universe were out there, codes one might decipher if smart enough, tenacious enough?”Truth be told, it’s kind of hard to put this book in a certain genre because it’s one of those stories that defies to be pegged as just one thing. If I had to describe it with a couple of words I’d say it’s a story about a Lady and a resurrection man, with a little dash of romance, mysterious happenings, a dangerous sickness and some Frankenstein-like edge that adds creepy and gory scenes to the mix. It’s also critical of society and emancipated. And for everyone who thinks this sounds like way too many topics and issues packed into just one small book: Don’t worry, despite all that it still works more than just well! ”It’s the lesson young girls everywhere were taught their entire lives – don’t be seduced by the men you meet, protect your virtue – until, of course, their entire lives depended on seduction by the right man. It was an impossible situation, a trick of society as a whole: force women to live at the mercy of whichever man wants them but shame them for anything they might do to get a man to want them. Passivity was the ultimate virtue.”I really loved Hazel as a character and it was so refreshing to see her fight all the stereotypes society wanted to push on her. I mean we have that 16 year old Lady that’s supposed to marry her cousin – the future Viscount Almont – and she completely refuses to give up the life she has built to become just another wife at the side of a powerful man. She wants to be powerful herself, she wants to help people and become a surgeon and despite being a young lady she doesn’t even hesitate to befriend a resurrection man and even accompanies him to dig up a corpse in order to study it. It were things like this, which caused me to root for her so much! Hazel had no qualms to get her hands dirty, no matter if it was with soil or entrails. This girl was amazing and she had her heart at the right place! ”Oi,” Thrupp barked at Burgess. “You’re lucky you have this pretty boy to protect you. You fancy yourself some sort of gentleman with those lined coats, Hazleton?”“Yeah,” Hazel responded with the most masculine swagger she could manage. “I do. And the ladies seem to like it just fine.” Burgess laughed at that, a full throaty laugh, and Thrupp retreated with an eye roll.Also it was extremely awesome she masqueraded as a boy named George Hazelton just to be able to attend anatomy lectures. We dig a girl that’s got her priorities straight and doesn’t let anyone hold her back from pursuing a career as a surgeon. And speaking of the anatomy lessons. The author really didn’t abstain from writing very detailed descriptions so if you’re one of the faint-hearted you better don’t pick up this book. Just a fair warning. Plus if we’re already at it: If you’re allergic to outdated misogynistic bullshit – like I am - you might end up hating a certain Dr. Straine and Hazel’s fiancé as well. Dr. Beecham, well he’s an entirely different story, but at least he had no objections to Hazel becoming a surgeon. The boy you’ll definitely fall in love with is Jack Currer, though! ”It was easy to die in Edinburgh, but Jack had made it seventeen years because he knew how to survive."Oh boy, how I loved Jack! He was such a kind and gentle soul and he deserved the world! I absolutely adored this boy and even though he earned his money by being a resurrection man I could totally understand where he was coming from. Times back then were hard and his job at the Le Grand Leon theatre just didn’t earn him enough money to live from it. Always hungry, no possessions aside of the clothes he wore, no friends and family to watch out for him, Jack had nothing but still managed to survive. Still, despite his own situation, he still cared about others and tried to help them as best as he could and that made him one of the most precious souls ever. Hazel and he might have come from very different backgrounds but they had that in common, they cared about others and this was exactly what made them work so well. =) ”I don’t find myself cavorting with high society ladies like yourself all too often, so it doesn’t strike me as an introduction one needs to make.”“We’ve already met. Twice,” Hazel reasoned.“Aye, but is it really meeting if I haven’t given ye a name?” he said, and this time he winked for real.Haha! Jack could be quite cheeky sometimes and I really liked that about him. Anyway! Those two meet and kinda start some sort of business together and even though the story is slow at some parts and there doesn’t happen a lot, the moments when things actually DO happen were written very well and had me glued to the pages. I was such a sucker for all the little moments between Jack and Hazel and I really wanted them to be together and to have a future with each other in their lives. Their chemistry was amazing and I was a huge fan of their gender swapped moments and scenes. It was an interesting dynamic because even though Jack is a boy, he’s still poor and doesn’t have all the chances and resources Hazel does. ”There ain't going to be any more bodies." He looked away and showed a heavy bruise across his left cheek. Before she could think better of it, Hazel strode forward and lifted Jack's face in her hands. Jack’s hair was particularly lank and dull, and his eyes were flat.See what I mean!? Every reader knows plenty of scenes like that, but it’s usually the man that lifts the girl’s face and not the other way around. No, seriously! I want more moments like this one in my books! Vulnerable and honest men should appear in more books! Period! ;-) As for how the book ended and how everything was resolved: I won’t spoil anything but I will say that I saw some of the revelations come from miles away! It didn’t take a lot of brain capacity to figure things out, but I’m not gonna lie: The overall ending threw me and I’m still not over it. Urgh! My heart! <3”My heart is yours, Hazel Sinnett,” Jack said. “Forever. Beating or still.”“Beating or still,” she said.Conclusion:“Anatomy: A Love Story” turned out to be completely different than I thought it would be. I expected a romance and was positively surprised to find out that this book tackled so many other topics as well. I still have a hard time to describe this story because it’s so unique and defies being put into just one genre so all I’ll say is: If you like historical fiction books that think outside of the box and feature strong female characters that defy society’s rules you’ll enjoy this book. And if you like a little mystery, some gory details and two characters that try to save innocent people while inadvertently falling in love – Well, then you’ll most definitely end up loving this book! ;-)________________________________NO, what was that ending?! O_oSomeone please tell me there’s another book and that I’ll get answers! >_<Also this was something different and I really enjoyed reading “Anatomy: A Love Story”. Hazel and Jack have my heart! <333 I really dislike damn Bernard, though. Can we please not have him in the next book (if there is one.) Full RTC soon! I need to look up if there’s a second instalment first. XD_________________________________I’m so intrigued by this book because I heard so many people rave about it. At first, I thought this would be a romance but as it seems the plot of “Anatomy: A Love Story” is completely different than I thought it would be. I mean we have Edinburgh in 1817, a woman who wants to be a surgeon and a resurrection man who makes a living from digging up graves and they both try to solve a mystery together?! As I said: I am intrigued. XDI can’t wait to dive into this! This is going to be good! =)Find me on:My BlogInstagram
5297427617	I had such a great time reading this!! 🤩🤩 It totally gave me the Gothic vibes that I wanted and while I did have some issues, I did really enjoy this overall!! 🥰🥰“It was an impossible situation, a trick of society as a whole: force women to live at the mercy of whichever man wants them but shame them for anything they might do to get a man to want them.”Anatomy: A Love Story follows Hazel Sinnett, a girl born into a wealthy family in 1817 Edinburgh. Hazel desperately wants to become a surgeon, but this is completely out of the norm for women at that time and results in Hazel being thrown out of Dr. Beecham's lectures. However, she's offered one chance to persue her ambitions and for her to succeed, she'll need corpses to study. Lucky that she's just met Jack Currer, who digs them up for a living... “What were miracles, but science that man didn’t yet understand? And didn’t that make it all the more miraculous that the secrets of the universe were out there, codes one might decipher if smart enough, tenacious enough?”This book intrigued me from the first time that I saw that gorgeous cover and I was happy to finally get my hands on it!! It seemed very Stalking Jack the Ripper-esque and I loved the concept. Even tho I didn't absolutely love it, I still had a very fun time reading it!! 💗Starting with the characters. Our main characters are Hazel and Jack, with a few side characters (tho not many). I did really like the characters! Hazel was a great protagonist- I loved her determination to become a surgeon despite it not typically being a woman's job, and I was rooting for her the whole time 🥰🥰 Jack was also a good character- he appears very much like a 'bad boy', but he has a very soft heart and was really sweet 😍😍 He honestly felt a lot like a cinnamon roll, and I really liked him. A very solid cast of characters! 🤗🤗Next, the writing. I was also a big fan of Dana Schwartz's writing style- it had this really cool 'old-timey' feel without being boring or hard to read. The writing was also super atmospheric and I loved the Gothic vibes. It was very fitting for the story 💕💕The plot. Hmmm. Here's where I felt a bit iffy. Although I liked the plot enough overall, I did have a few minor problems with it. My main problem was that this book was very much pitched as a 'Gothic ROMANCE', especially with the title including 'A Love Story' and so I was expecting it to be mainly centered around the romance with a side plot of Hazel trying to become a surgeon. However, the romance often actually started around 50% and even then it developed pretty quickly- in fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to call it instalove 😬😬 My expectations in terms of the amount of romance were definitely not met. Also, wish this book was a little longer bc with a little more development in some things it could've been just that tad bit better! *sigh* 😒😒However, it wasn't too bad overall and it did manage to keep me interested. Despite my complaints about the romance being too a bit too underdeveloped, it was still very cute and I was a big fan of Jack and Hazel as a couple! ❤ Some of the quotes were adorable 🥺🥺 So, yeah, the plot was decent in the end and the romance very cute, if a bit underdeveloped.“Someone should tell you you're beautiful every time the sun comes up. Someone should tell you you're beautiful on Wednesdays. And at teatime. Someone should tell you you're beautiful on Christmas Day and Christmas Eve and the evening before Christmas Eve, and on Easter. He should tell you on Guy Fawkes Night and on New Year's, and on the eighth of August, just because.” ~ He's so sweet 🥺🥺“My heart is yours, Hazel Sinnett," Jack said. "Forever. Beating or still.”Overall, a very entertaining read! 🥰🥰 Would definitely recommend if you want:✔ Gothic vibes✔ Feminism! ✔ Cute romance subplot✔ Good characters and writingI would definitely be interested in picking up the sequel! ❤~ Strong 3.5 stars ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a really enjoyable story!! 🤩🤩 I had a great time with it 🥰🥰RTC!

5921164577	This book cast such a spell on me that I immediately recommended it to my deskmate at uni… who passed it to her sister (a doctor)… who passed it on to her work colleagues. You get the idea: it was that good. 🕯️📚🖤📖 Book: Anatomy: A Love Story🖋️ Author: Dana Schwartz🌟 Rating: 4.5 ✧💖 Genre: gothic historical fiction 📚 Series: The Anatomy Duology🌸 Summary: Set in foggy 19th-century Edinburgh, this story follows Hazel Sinnett, a girl who wants nothing more than to become a surgeon in a world that refuses to let her. Determined and a little rebellious, she sneaks into lectures, studies corpses, and pushes her way into medicine… even as strange disappearances, unsettling discoveries, and a surreal twist of fate pull her deeper into a mystery that blurs the line between life and death. “Mortui vivos docent; the dead teach the living.” ♡ What I loved most:• The medical detail: You can feel how deeply the author dove into the world of medicine and history — the accuracy, the sensory details, the atmosphere… it made everything feel so vividly alive 🩸• Hazel’s journey through anatomy: it felt raw and real. I’ll never forget the description of how anatomy books don’t prepare you for the truth — the sheer darkness of blood, the overwhelming realness of it all 📚 “What were miracles, but science that man didn’t yet understand? And didn’t that make it all the more miraculous that the secrets of the universe were out there, codes one might decipher if smart enough, tenacious enough?” • The historical setting: it was gorgeous. I could practically hear the clatter of carriage wheels and imagine the swish of corseted dresses through the fog 🌫️• The academia: watching Hazel chase her place in a world that kept trying to shut her out felt emotional and empowering — like watching a flame flicker stubbornly in the dark 🕯️ “Being a woman had closed many doors to Hazel Sinnett, but it had also revealed to her a valuable tool in her arsenal: women were almost entirely overlooked as people, which gave her the power of invisibility. People saw women, they saw the dresses women wore on public walks through the park, and the gloved hands they rested on their suitors’ elbows at the theater, but women were never threats.” • The twist: it was unexpected, surreal, but somehow perfect. I gasped 😳 “‘Every one of us deserves to die,’ Dr. Beecham said. ‘It is our only birthright.’” • The emotional undercurrents: Hazel’s constant sense of being unheard, of never quite being enough… that hit close 🥀✘ What I didn't love:• The open ending: I needed just a little more closure (I was feral for answers) 😭• The romance: it was cute, but I wanted a bit more development — just a few extra sparkles 💘 “‘My heart is yours, Hazel Sinnett,’ Jack said. ‘Forever. Beating or still.’” ───♡─────────────୨ৎ Overall:This book cast such a spell on me that I immediately recommended it to my deskmate at uni… who passed it to her sister (a doctor)… who passed it on to her work colleagues. You get the idea: it was that good.With gothic vibes, a richly drawn historical setting, a twisty final reveal, a sprinkle of romance, and an academically driven heroine with a passion for medicine — it checked every one of my boxes.Anatomy left an imprint on me, sharp and soft all at once. It made me feel seen, stirred, and just a little haunted. And yes… book two is already in my hands.xoxo, until the next book 🕯️📖🖤「The Anatomy Duology」#1 Anatomy: A Love Story — 4.5 ✧#2 Immortality: A Love Story — 4.75 ✧
4205327034	Honestly, I don’t think this book was a good match for me, personally. ☹️ It’s a bit too gothic and dark and I’m a baby with blood and cuts and dead bodies. 🤮 But I appreciate the writing of time period, scene descriptions, characters etc. So, I think this one will have reviews all over the place. 😬
4317466193	My thanks to Dana Schwartz, St. Martin's Press and Netgalley. It's nearly a given with me that if a book is written well, and in this time period, then I'm probably going to love it! What made this one extra special though were the main characters. My love was strong and true for a woman who wants to break out of the mold, and become a Doctor/Surgeon. A man, a body snatcher, who has no other option. I was intrigued by the odd nature of other goings on. Which, by the way were really never explained. But, I could also see how this could be continued into another book. Eh, we'll see? I'll confess that I'd be happy to read more. These characters were compelling.
4967176801	⭐⭐⭐⭐½ THEMES AND VIBES: • dark, gruesome, atmospheric, moody • Edinburgh at the beginning of the 19th century • a love story, not so much a romance • a young lady fighting the norms to become a surgeon • dark academia • a dash of alchemyLots of mixed reviews, but I loved it! It's a new favorite! You can check out all my thoughts on my book blog NovelOnMyMind.

IM READING THIS BC OF THIS GORG COVER. and also I’m pretty sure it’s a feminist book SO PLUSSS FOR ME. no cus wdym a girl wants to become a surgeon in the 19th century while the boy is a body snatcher? like yes SIGN ME UP.
4648697156	For a journalist, the author seems to have done 0 research for this book. There is no concept of time in the book, historically nor within the plot itself.I really wanted to like this. The cover was beautiful and enticing. A promise of a gothic romance hooked me. A woman studying to he a physician in the 19th century? Yes please. Edinburgh? I live close by, this will be fun. I was left disappointed. Very quickly it became clear the romance in this book will be poor. No set up, lack of chemistry, vague execution. Almost insta-lovey. The protagonist balanced carefully on okay to 'not-like-other-girls'. She did put down other women a few times, but I am glad she didn't fully fall into hating other women. Very poorly written. The author fails to decide between using omniscient and limited 3rd person narration. The characters were very bland and the plot was relatively predictable. The book was also poorly researched, considering the topic. A quick google search confirmed that Beatelgeuse (which I appreciated as a reference until the author heavy-handedly felt the urge to explain in case I missed it) wasn't discovered until 1836 and appendicitis wasn't operated on until 1880. The depiction of time was inconsistent, with letters sent from dates before characters even left to travel and a pregnancy of 8 months either being missed by someone described as observant or the author forgot how long a pregnancy takes. The editing utterly failed with this book. I had no concept of time and it seems neither did the author. Weeks were said to pass but then an insert indicated only 2 days passed. A medical degree was apparently studied for only a month... Also, I am sorry, but what the f**k was the whole outing to the Prince's Gardens (which btw did not exist until after the draining of the Loch at around 1820) to enjoy the last day of reasonable weather before spring? It was december (or november if we didn't move that far yet. Honestly, I have no idea, the book is confusing about this) and the MC sat on the ground to read. In what scotland?? Also parasols against the sun? In Scotland? Spring is when we start to get sunshine. Did I miss something or is this book based in an AU where Scotland is in the Southern Hemisphere and science progressed farther than it did in 1817? Solutions were convenient. Plot was too simple and bland to be called gothic. I wanted to appreciate the commentary and the nods to philosophy. But the author felt the need to hand-feed me the insights and explanations as if I wasn't capable of reaching conclusions myself and extracting meaning. The book was however a quick easy read. And mildly enjoyable. I did like Dr Beecham and his morally grey depiction. I hope the dude has a good long life. For all its sins... The lack of editorial oversight was the worst. Had the author stuck to 3rd person limited, she may have built at least some tension and interest to the plot. Also, it would have been nice if the author kept some sort of reasonable track of time passing and realistic weather for the season she is describing.

Count me in 🤭ᯓ𝘌𝘥𝘪𝘵 : THE COVER IS SOO 😌😫
5484864512	when buying this book, i hoped that this would kinda be like Stalking Jack the Ripper because i really enjoyed that book. luckily, i think it had a very similar vibe, which i obviously enjoyed!! the first impression was great!i really enjoyed the plot. it was exciting and yes, sometimes a bit disgusting because of the detailed describtions of the illnesses or operations, but that only added to the fun reading experience and to the gothic vibes. there were many things happening (like for example just generally what hazel was doing, the resurrection men disappearing and the illness in edinburgh), so i definetly wasn't bored. i liked discovering the connections between some of the things and there were nice plot twists, especially at the ending.i like hazel, especially because she wouldn't stop believing in her dream of becoming a medic even though literally everyone she knew were against it and even found it funny/pitiful, just because it's 1817 and she's a woman. i mean, even her mother didn't want to hear anything about it. so, i found hazel to be very inspiring and am so proud of her for not giving up. i like that she always defended herself, always wanted to become smarter and didn't need someone (aka a man...) to tell her how she must be and act. she isn't "afraid" of working for her dream to come true and doesn't mind getting her hands dirty by doing so, despite her being an upper class lady. she cares for the poor people and wants to give them the chance of having someone who helas their wounds.now that i've mentioned her mother, i must add that i felt sorry for hazel for how she got treated by her. the mother is in mourning after having lost the eldest son a year ago and simply kinda ignores hazel's existance. yet, she always talks about and is around hazel's little brother, thereby making hazel feel unwelcome and left out, which must've really hurt :(jack definitely deserves a better life. not only is he poor and involved in the whole resurection thing (which is freaking dangerous and very hard work for little money), he also falls for hazel despite her being someone with a much higher social rank and then, in the end, he literally almost dies. damn.still, he is such a wonderful man. he is kind, thoughtful, gentle, he respects hazel so much, truly believes in her and always supports her. also, he is so funny, i laughed out loud multiple times because of his humour and general wit. and let's not forget that he is super hot. what more could you want?! jack and hazel working together and thereby getting to know each other more and more was super fun to read! there is so much tension, partly because i feel like they've got great chemistry, but also because it's forbidden romance!! jack is poor, getting money by doing an illegal job and then there's hazel, an upper-class woman who's been engaged with her cousin (yes, her cousin...) practically her whole life. their story has these romantic, dark vibes and is literally a grave yard romance (they had their first kiss at night, hidden in a grave they just dug up 🤭).i have to say though, that in the beginning, there wasn't much about the romance between her and jack, so don't get disappointed, i promise you it gets better! they share wonderful moments together and have the cutest and most heartwarming and -wrenching conversations.also, that ending? i cried, both happy and sad tears. i love how it's a kinda open end, which i'm surpised by because it normally pisses me of lmao. but here, it just fit the vibes and i think it made sense for it to be like that. that's also why i won't read the second book anytime soon, i've seen quite a lot of negative reviews.furthermore, i read that the author didn't actually plan on writing it and wanted to originally end the story like this, so i find myself doinf exactly that lol!--------------------------------------------------------------------that ending???? I'm sad yet so happy at the same time 😭💕rtc!
5998723155	“𝙈𝙮 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙞𝙨 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙨, 𝙃𝙖𝙯𝙚𝙡 𝙎𝙞𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙩𝙩." “𝙁𝙤𝙧𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧. 𝘽𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙤𝙧 𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙡𝙡.”This was the definition of forbidden dreams and romance. It has great potential but it flopped by the ending for me.Other than that this book was okish that's it. (It could've been better..But the ending ....😩)
7289276384	the most unexpected 5 star book ever. but AMAZING nonetheless!!! idk how to describe this book but it was so sooo good! the plot was SO unique but still didn't feel unrealstic! i feel like the author kind of bent multiple genres together that i normally hate lol but somehow worked here!! i loved the characters, and i loved the historical fiction setting and vibes! its such a smart book! idk how to explain that but like the author was able to come up with one of the most unique and well written books I've ever read! the dark acadamia vibes were soooo good and i loved the subplots! we got romance, thriller, historical fiction, feminism, and found family, all wrapped up in a neat little bow!! i will forever recommend this book, its sooo well done and unique!! ╔═.✾. ════╗tw's; misogyny, childbirth, blood/gore, body horror, plague, dead bodies, dismemberment, hanging╚════.✾. ═╝
4444347225	** spoiler alert ** I received an ARC from Wednesday books in exchange for an honest review.This had a fair bit of promise, and since it's a debut, I'm thinking Dana Schwartz has some potential! Sadly, this didn't end up being a book for me, but I'll start with the things that worked!The dialogue was quick and natural, never feeling like something that wouldn't come out of the characters' mouths. There was only one instance (that I recall) where the dialogue was altered to fit a typical Scottish accent, and while that left me forgetting where the book was taking place (a couple slang words probably would have helped), it was much better than when all the dialogue poorly molds itself to an accent.I liked the premise a fair bit - it feels reminiscent of Stalking Jack the Ripper, of course, but we can always use more books about plucky women who want to do the more gruesome bits of science. One of the issues isn't entirely to do with the book itself, but the synopsis provided online for it - spoilers for the book will follow this line.The synopsis gives the books premise as such: "But after she gets kicked out of renowned surgeon Dr. Beecham’s lectures for being the wrong gender, she realizes that her new acquaintance might be more helpful than she first thought." This reads like a typical catalyst for a story. The problem is this part of the synopsis happens between 36 and 47% of the ARC I read - twice as far into a book as I'd expect. Which means so much of the book is already "gone" before the hook that pulled me in finally gets going.I didn't like the "magic" or "alchemy" inclusion of this - it was apparent that was going to be where we were going but it didn't really feel like it "fit." The book relies on it so little, if stakes had been raised gradually throughout and there had been a bit more explanation for how the "magic" worked (maybe involving the root that Hazel had been using), I would have been very pleased with it.The romance didn't entirely work for me, and it felt a little shoehorned in. There is a moment where Jack and Hazel are doing something intense and he's like "now's the moment, kiss her!!" and I was like "wait what??? you want to kiss her?" it felt like Avril says - he was a boy, she was a girl, and thus, romance! I wanted a bit more than that.I would have liked the ending to be more ambiguous. The book has three separate parts where it takes the ambiguity of the ending away and each of them felt more and more unnecessary than the last. I would have preferred if only the "horse" one was mentioned and the rest left, it would have been more thrilling of an ending for me.Also this is small, but there is a side character who loses their uterus to the shady body snatching going on, and Hazel becomes aware of it, but no on page explanation to the girl happens, and it feels weird. I would have liked to see that explained to her, but that's a personal preference.As you can see, most of my preferences were stylistic choices, and not on the technical writing of the book, so I thinks Schwartz has potential to write a story I will love, even if this one missed its mark with me. I hope other people like this story, though, and I'm sure some people will completely disagree with everything I've said.
5843346070	Книжка, в заголовку якої пише «Історія кохання» мала б містити більше кохання 😒 мені було замало! Хоч і читалось легко та захопливо, загалом лишилось розчарована. Мінімальна інтрига зʼявляється лише в другій половині книги, та й то - мені одразу все було зрозуміло, до чого йде 🤷🏻‍♀️Але читати другу хочеться 😂👌🏻
5034143720	If you told me Hazel and Jack were 12 years old, I’d believe it. My favorite character was the frog. The dead one.
4527568527	The wonderful aspect of this book is the amount of research done. Dana Schwartz writes with a talent that makes you believe every part of the story is true. She delves deep into the human anatomy and writes like an expert. Hazel wants to be a surgeon more than anything in a world that doesn't allow women to do much more than get married. She enrolls in a course taught by the a renowned surgeon who tells her if she can pass the exams she gets to stay. When Hazel befriends Jack, things chance. Jack digs bodies for a living and Hazel and him help each other learn more about the human anatomy--after all he's selling the bodies for research. Things turn for the worst when people start disappearing and the Roman Fever looms in the air. Overall, I enjoyed this novel, but at times found the details daunting and a bit morbid. There is less love in this story and more mystery, a lot of gore includes. The setting was intriguing. I later read the author lived in a castle while writing much of the story which rang true for authenticity. Overal all 3/5 stars
4161482187	Anatomy: A Love Story by Dana Schwartz is primarily a historical fiction story at it’s core. This one also has a bit of fantasy, a bit of romance and an air of mystery all in a gothic setting so of course it grabbed my interest being a fan of books that define being classified as any one thing.The story is set in Edinburgh in the year 1817 where Hazel Sinnett is at the age where she is discovering who she is and who that is doesn’t like being stuck in the female role. Hazel would much rather become a surgeon than be married off to her suitor.Hazel grasps her opportunity to study by sneaking into lectures as a male but when Hazel meets Jack Currer she sees an opportunity to take her studies one step further. You see, Jack is a resurrection man and he can bring Hazel the bodies she needs to further her education with practice on a real corpse.Anatomy: A Love Story by Dana Schwartz was such a fun book to read. This was a unique story with a strong female lead trying to break out of society’s expectations. It’s odd to say there is gruesome and gore but still some romance and more in this novel. Definitely one that kept the pages turning wondering where the story would lead next.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/
4561811191	“It was an impossible situation, a trick of society as a whole: force women to live at the mercy of whichever man wants them but shame them for anything they might do to get a man to want them.”This book was a pleasant surprise, and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I say so because the description and the genres (young adult historical fiction/romance) did not sound like my cup of tea, but it got my attention from the first chapter and I had a very good time overall reading it. Mainly, it was just different from the other young adult books that are being published or that I usually read, so to me it felt like a breath of fresh air. Also, this was more gothic than I expected, and I love a good gothic book when I find one!
5842160260	Чому я не дотягнула ще трішки з цією книгою? Вона б ідеально пасувала до моїх атмосферних жовтневих читань🍂Головна героїня у нас аристократичного походження і мріє стати хірургом. Головний герой викопує і продає трупи для анатомічних розтинів. Ідеальна пара, що тут ще сказати😆Я люблю медичний нонфікшн, тож художня книга на цю тему не могла мені не сподобатися. Не зважаючи на певну умовність (читай: спрощеність) деяких моментів, які ми пробачаємо (або не пробачаємо) жанрові young-adult, я дійсно непогано провела час з цією історією. Фінт сюжету наприкінці був занадто передбачуваним, але все ж із задоволенням прочитаю продовження.п.с. Чутливим людям застереження: тут викопують трупи, проводять розтини, вивчають на мерцях анатомію, відрізають частини тіла. Зважайте.
4533944750	This story was so creepy and grotesque but need I say I LOVED IT. I was hooked from the very first page! I couldn’t get enough of the scary parts and honestly wish there had been more. 👻My only complaint was the fantasy/magical element felt a little out of place and the middle of the book drug on quite a bit. Other than that, this was such a strong debut and I can only begin to imagine what creepy stories this author will write next!
6297753467	“i’m not a fool, jack currer, no matter how you might think of me.”“oh, i assure, miss sinnett, i’ve taken you for a lot of things, but a fool was never one of them.”DANA SCHWARTZ !!! this was incredible and it FINALLY filled the space in my heart after i read stalking jack the ripper (literally four years ago). sorry i’m being dramatic, but this is how i am in every review of a novel that’s risen to my favorites. it won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, because it’s very specific— and i’m not even really sure where this falls in terms of genre, but it would best be described as gothic academia/horror-ish with a twist of romance. ✶⋆.˚ overall ˚.⋆✶the premise of this (summarizing the summary) follows miss hazel sinnett, a higher class lady who dreams of working as a surgeon. jack currer is a ‘resurrection man’ who makes a living off of selling dead bodies, the two striking a mutually beneficial deal. this already sets up the gothic academic aesthetic of the novel (which i devour every time), as well as the main couple. this is combined with an element of history, which i LOVED as a fiend for european history and culture. it was perfectly tailored to so many of my interests. AND it includes aspects of frankenstein, which you’ll just have to uncover by reading this! some warning though, if you are a squeamish person, this may not be up your alley 😭🫶₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ hazel sinnettshe is one of my new favorite fmcs of ALL TIME. if only hazel sinnett was a real person in history because i would take the time to learn everything about her. she has strength, so much bravery, and i just loved reading from her perspective. she shows that bravery can be through intellect and gentleness. hazel’s journey and aspirations were a big focus of the book, which i loved! i could write an essay about her character, but it honestly might just turn into me praising her for five pages.jack currer ₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧okay. first of all. jack currer the man that you are!! he was such a fun character (though i’m not sure that’s the right word to use) to read about and follow throughout the novel. the words this man said.. like i was falling in love with hazel 😭 he also had complexity, and the ending?! you will just have to read this book. i was actually driven insane by the ending to the point where i just had to go straight to the second book!please read this if it sparks any interest at all. BEGGING because it was so good for me and i hope it’ll be good for u all too 💌✨💐 pre-review:i have no words. this was amazing and it gave me chills and it made me feel something i haven’t with a book in a LONG TIME. it was the most amazing experience, even considering the quite gruesome (?) premise…💌 pre-read: last book of the readathon (we have like 10 minutes left!!) and i’m starting this .. saw a piece of fanart of the couple in this and that is what MADE me want to read it so bad 🤭✨✨
5842154657	Не знаю, мені прям норм, десь на 3.5 і точно буду читати наступну частину 👌 Читалося ну дуже легко і просто, мозок відпочивав, інтриги як такої й не було, ну тобто, була, але вона настільки очевидна, що просто лишилося дочекатися цього моменту) (Але це не критика взагалі, ну просто знаючи, що отримаєш потім і не має претензій)Насправді дуже мила головна героїня і певно через те, що фон/місце виглядали настільки реалістично, що потім і забулося що це фентезі 😅 просто таке дуже делікатне і часом саме такого не вистачає Та й ніде правди діти - це не історія кохання 😅ну бо те, шо було, важко назвати розвитком стосунків і з такою швидкістю, тому тут не варто вірити назві на 100%Але дуже сподобалося те, як авторка передала позицію(або відсутність такої) жінки у 18 ст. - емоційно прям дуже зачепило, я забула що раніше ми могли ніх…чого 🙈
5708742821	Ich fand's richtig gut. Irgendwie habe ich damit gerechnet und war gleichzeitig doch davon überrascht, WIE gut es mir gefallen hat. :D Es sind keine fünf Sterne, schätze ich, sondern eher 4,5. Ein paar Dinge gingen mir etwas zu schnell oder in der Summe der Teile ein wenig unter, aber alles in allem? Diese Atmosphäre, dieses düster-makabere, die Entwicklung der Protagonistin, die ... Andersartigkeit der Geschichte?! Zum Glück ist es nicht mehr lange bis Band 2 erscheint, uff. Hab's echt beinahe komplett an einem Abend durchgelesen, hat richtig Spaß gemacht.

6300076862	I think this book took me like 3 hours to read give or take? Book 2# in my readathon. PLOT: This books takes place in 1817?? Something like that, we follow the high society lady named hazel. As in society at that time she is expected to be married off to a wealthy family and bring money and status to her family. But that is not what she wants to do. She wants to be a one of the most manly dirty professions out there, she wants to be a surgeon. She tries to attend lectures but she is kicked out because she is a women. But if she completes the exam or whatever without help from professionals she can become a surgeon, whilst she is studying and stuff with the help of a grave digger named jack they discover strange things in the city.THOUGHTS: I think this is marketed wrong. It literally says on the cover that it’s a love story but tbh it’s way more of a women’s fiction/historical fiction, it focuses way more on her struggles as a women in the 19th century and we only got really an ensy weensy bit of romance towards the end so don’t go into it expecting a romance. With that said I could really relate to the main character because I was that weird kid who brought medical encyclopedias to reading time in elementary school, and I would like to become a doctor, so that part was pretty good. I also really liked all the articles and tidbits we got at the beginning of each chapter. This book isn’t for everyone I would say but it was a clean romance/womens fiction that I personally enjoyed.
4484430350	Well, crap. Now, I'm in tears.Friends, please give this book some leniency at the start - it's setting the tone and atmosphere which may seem like slow pacing... but it's not. It freaking turns into an incredible tale of 19th Century female empowerment meets confronting narcissistic wannabe Dr. Franksteins meets an endearing love story. AND I ATE IT UP!I love this book so much that I had a quote from it inscribed on my wedding band. YEP. Any guesses?!
7090950410	This was SUCH a cute (gory) quick read 😭😭😭 I loved everyone in this book (kidding I only liked Jack, hazel, iona, cook, Charles)The atmosphere was beautiful and it felt so alive to me!!Jack was the absolute sweetest man of the century 😭😭 I will never get enough of reading about him I WANT MORE ☹️ ESPECIALLY WITH HIS ENDING!!!Hazel you are so amazing?? Like hello how were you so chill through all of this, but girl I love you so much!!!The romance felt a little bit quick, I would've liked more slow burn but I didn't mind really I loved it either way, the Bernard subplot was... Interesting but I'm not going to get into that!!I've always wanted a story on the grave dig ups from the 1800's so I'm so glad I found this 😭!!I can tell it won't be for everyone, but if you want a quick gothic read this one works!!XoxoYour girly

It permits the possibility of losing.""Oh, I assure you, Miss Sinnet, I've taken you for a lot of things, but a fool was never one of them.""...and staying alive meant trusting only himself.""One of the first lessons he'd learned in the narrow closes and tight hidey-holes of the underbelly of Edinburgh was never to rely on someone with less to lose than you did.""How precariously they balanced on the precipice between promise and ruin.""He didn't have any good reason to trust Hazel Sinnet, but he did so anyway.""Every one of us deserves to die. It is our only birthright."
5687437782	Ok, nu mă așteptam să-mi placă cartea asta, recunosc :). Am crezut că e o poveste de iubire cu adolescenți și că titlul nu este neapărat concludent. Titlul este cât se poate de concludent și cred că trebuie să te ferești de cartea asta dacă nu-ți plac detaliile despre chirurgie, cadavre și chestii de astea. În Scoția anilor 1800, există o tânără ariatocrată cu viitorul stabilit deja de familie (doamne, ce familie dubioasă); își dorește să devină chirurg dar din păcate nu este vremea potrivită în care femeile pot hotărî ce cale să urmeze, unde mai pui că a fi chirurg în acea perioadă nu era o meserie dorită. Cu o dorință de nestăpânit și cu un ajutor neașteptat, Hazel încearcă să-și urmeze visul chiar dacă metodele pe care este nevoită să le abordeze nu sunt cele mai etice sau simple. Povestea de iubire despre care se amintește pe copertă este mult prea neînsemnată față de întreaga acțiune și cu siguranță nu este punctul de interes. Mi-a plăcut cartea datorită subiectului și datorită atmosferei. M-a trimis cu gândul la o carte de nonficțiune pe care am îndrăgit-o tare mult: Arta măcelăritului, carte care a și servit drept inspirație pentru acest roman. Finalul mi-a scăzut puțin din entuziasm pentru că e puțin neverosimil dar lasă loc pentru un volum următor.
6587753422	oh my goodness i LOVED this. such a sweet book! although i had predicted the direction it was going, i absolutely loved every second of it. i’m torn between a 4.75⭐️ and a 5⭐️, but i’m keeping it at a 5 for now!
4393013836	Thanks to Netgalley and Macmillan Audio for the ARC. It hasn’t affected the content of my review.I did the thing where the beautiful cover lured me in, but this time it wasn’t a disaster! In fact, the book mostly earns it! I was *thisclose* to giving Anatomy: A Love Story five stars, in fact, until the ending. YMMV on this ending, seriously. What happened is something that I have read in YA historical fiction books before, and it bothered me there as well, and didn’t bother others. I will do a spoiler tagged section below if you are curious.Basically, 90% of this book was five-star worthy for me, and 10% I am ambivalent about. There is going to be a sequel and I will read it, so maybe by then or after I will be less ambivalent. I am also extremely curious to see what future readers will think as well.Okay, blathering over. The main things to know about this book is that you can 100% tell it’s a book written by Dana Schwartz about things that really interest her. In this case: the history of surgery, body snatching, Edinburgh, class differences, gothic vibes, murder, and smooching. The level of historical detail, and other kinds of detail she includes, is extremely impressive, to the point that for large sections of this book, it did not read at all like YA.Our main character is Hazel Sinnett, a young lady of the noble class who has been betrothed to her cousin, soon to be a viscount, since she was a baby. But Hazel, who spent her childhood reading her father’s anatomy books, does not want to marry, she wants to be a surgeon. After witnessing (an impressively gory) surgical demonstration by world famous surgeon Dr. Beecham in which he enthusiastically lops a guy’s leg off with a bone saw, she decides to take classes to qualify as a doctor, and dresses up as a boy to do it. She is found out before she can get any practical training, and ends up making a wager with Beecham, that if she passes the qualifying exam without any training, he will take her on as his apprentice and allow women into his classes going forward. But how is she to get practical experience with human anatomy? Enter Jack Currer, Resurrection Man, digger up of and purveyor of bodies.There was so much in this book that I loved, including Hazel, who loves her chosen field with all of her being, but there were so many small details in there that were just glorious, especially if you like things more on the macabre end of the spectrum. There is one scene early in the book where Hazel witnesses a surgeon extracting a tooth from a poor man, and immediately implanting into the mouth of a rich man, and the rich man pays the poor one for his tooth, while the poor man sits there crying and bleeding. This was a real thing that happened! There is also a strange plague they call the Roman Fever ravaging Edinburgh, though the author wrote the first draft before the pandemic started, and Hazel accidentally falls into running a free clinic for the city’s poor. The mixture of determination, fear, and curiosity in Hazel’s personality made me want all the best for her at all times.This is not really a romance, though there is smooching in it, but it is a love story, and I think it’s pretty easy to tell that the main love story here is between Hazel and her chosen profession. She doesn’t even start her body-snatching scheme with Jack until halfway through the novel, but her quest to become a surgeon is well under way by 25% in.And now, the thing. (view spoiler)[So, I really do not like it when speculative or fantasy elements intrude on otherwise perfectly realistic stories. This book is so fact-based, and so science-based, and has such a feel of lived-in history about it, that when you find out that Dr. Beecham has not only created some fantastical serum that not only makes it possible to transplant organs without the aid of anti-rejection drugs, but that he has also discovered the secret of immortality, and has been posing as his own son, and then grandson, in order to keep going in his career, it feels completely out of left field. It doesn’t fit. It’s also the climax of the mystery plot, as well as Hazel’s arc to get her license, both because Dr. Beecham is the one holding the fate of her career in his hands, but also because the author makes her have to choose between taking the exam (she doesn’t! ughhhh) and unraveling Dr. Beecham’s elaborate organ stealing scheme. In interviews, the author does note that she was careful to place ahistorical details throughout the book to clue people in that this was a different universe than ours, but they’re such little details that only the biggest history nerd is going to notice them. And even if they were noticed, the mundanity of the changes (i.e. anesthesia being invented twenty years early) in now way forecast a fantastical element as intense as immortality. I maybe could have lived with the organ transplanting serum, but the immortality took it so far across the line that I couldn’t help feeling dissatisfied and unhappy while listening to the rest of the book. (hide spoiler)]I did the audio for this one, and it was fantastic. There are dual narrators, Mhairi Morrison for the majority of the main narrative, and Tim Campbell for the clips from newspapers and medical journals set between chapters. The Scottish vibes were impeccable.Again, will be very interested to see what other people have to say about this book. I hope many of you give it a try.
4235430321	I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. Stealing a body was against the law, but if they actually took any property from the grave, that would make it a felony. Hazel Sinnett comes from a wealthy family, is almost engaged to her cousin who is in line to become a viscount but she still dreams of becoming a surgeon. It's 1817 in Edinburgh, though, and Hazel is forced to dress as a boy when she finagles a way to attend classes at the Royal Edinburgh Anatomists’ Society, taught by the leading physician at the time, Dr. Beecham. Hazel has read and reread, Dr. Beecham's grandfather's medical treatise book and is excited to learn from him. And so Jack Currer became a resurrection man. Jack Currer has managed to survive on the streets by working at the local theater and making some needed side money by digging up freshly buried bodies and selling them to the Anatomists' Society for the students and doctors to learn from. When he helps a society girl sneak into a medical demonstration, neither realize how it will change their lives. The boy in the shadows looked up, and for a moment Hazel locked eyes with him, the hairs on the back of her neck standing at attention. Anatomy: A Love Story, was a Gothic toned story that also added in some mystery, suspense, paranormal, historical fiction, and romance. Hazel and Jack are both seventeen, so I can see their ages being the reason this is getting tagged as young adult but I can see this being enjoyed by adults maybe even more. The pace is gradual and while Hazel leads us, the story is more about the plot swirling around her and Jack than the actual characters themselves. I could see younger readers getting restless while older ones would sink in more. Readers who enjoy the series, Veronica Speedwell, Lady Sherlock, and Wrexford and Sloane, might want to check this out. This first book doesn't quite deliver the romance genre HEA but gives an ending that could easily lead to a series and I could see it falling into the essence of the other series mentioned, just with younger protagonists. “Gentlemen, I give you ethereum. Or, what I have taken to calling in the laboratory, the Scotsman’s dodge.” After her older brother died from Roman Fever (malaria), Hazel's mother slipped into depression and only cares about coddling and protecting the younger brother Percy. With her military father off guarding Napoleon, Hazel is pretty much left to her own devices. She occasionally goes out with her cousin Bernard, who shows flashes of possessiveness and is slowly trying to get Hazel to give up her dream of being a surgeon, nevertheless, Hazel realizes the importance of marrying him, having security. Hazel's focus on her quest to become a surgeon has her a bit naive at times, it feeds certain plots but this also makes it feel forced. There were times that it was obvious that the author was driving the plot, instead of a naturalness from the characters. All the threads involving the medicine of the day, ether being introduced, were intriguing and a little gory, adding to the Gothic tone and I liked how it tied into the mystery plot of people disappearing; is it a resurgence of Roman Fever or something more sinister. “And how much do you charge for something like that?” she asked. “A body.”“That depends. Are you in the market for one”? “That depends,” Hazel replied. “Do you make deliveries?” The romance doesn't really get going until around 50% and even then it's not the focus. Hazel and Jack start to spend more time together when Hazel gets discovered as a girl at the Society, enters into a deal with Dr. Beecham, and ends up paying Jack for bodies to study on. We get to know Hazel pretty well but Jack didn't feel as flushed out as there were other focuses in the story. These two were sweet together but their youth and circumstances keep the story from giving them too much of relationship development. The secondary characters were utilized well and if this does continue on into a series, I definitely want to see more of Jack's friend Munro and the Dr. Straine. It was easy to die in Edinburgh, but Jack had made it seventeen years because he knew how to survive. As I read an advanced reading copy, I don't want to give too much away but the ending does provide some revelations I saw coming and one that was a surprise and changed, if made into a series, where I thought it was going to go. This had a Gothic tone, some mystery, romance, and a twist of paranormal, I'd definitely pick up a second book to see where the plot takes the characters next.
4443117865	i really, really wanted to love this book! a gothic historic romance (!!) set in regency edinburgh (!!!) dealing with resurrectionists and early-19th c. medicine (!!!!) is right up my alley. part of that fascination stems from my job where i work in a historic burial ground from the 1700s that's home to several of america's early medical pioneers. in grad school, i'd also taken a seminar on the history of the body in the early atlantic world, which dealt with a lot of freaky & funky medical history, including a trip to the mütter museum (which, according to the acknowledgements, may have inspired parts of this book). so the subject matter drew me in, as well as the fact that i love the author—but the story just never lived up to its expectations.maybe my expectations were too high. i haven't read YA fiction in a while, and i'm more accustomed to either adult fiction or stupid dense historical monographs from university presses. but the pacing of this story was off; the titular (?? we'll come back to that later) romance doesn't even get going until halfway through the book, and Everything Happens So Much in the last fifty pages that my head was swimming. i wish we'd gotten more of jack's perspective, as well as a cleaner delineation of when the POV switched. sometimes it happened in the middle of a chapter! sometimes the narrator seemed omniscient! it's not a big issue, but it did annoy me.another thing that annoyed me—and i know i'm being pedantic here—is the constant attention dawn to how "constricting" and "oppressive" women's clothing was, in 1817 scotland, at the height of the greek revival and regency-style fashion craze. for one, stays and corsets were not inherently uncomfortable. in fact, they were just as supportive (if not more supportive!) than modern undergarments. i am well aware that tightlacing was a Thing, but not everyone did it—and its prevalence may have even been exaggerated/sensationalized by dress reformers later in the 19th century. also: in 1817, loose empire waists, gauzy column dresses, and light, breathable fabrics were en vogue. most women did not even wear corsets; if they did, they were very short, very loose stays. if hazel is complaining that her corset is ill-fitting, she needs to get thee to a tailor. every garment you put on your body was tailor-made to fit you and you alone! looking back, some of the fashions and constructions may seem impractical, but people weren't going to wear things that were incredibly uncomfortable! like. corsets = oppression is literally my least favorite trope in the whole world. i love the genre of historical fiction, and i think it can be really valuable to visualize history in this way; we can learn a little more about who we are, who we were, who we might be. when faced with a glaring anachronism, i'm more than willing to suspend my disbelief if it serves the narrative. that being said, there are other, more historically-accurate (and less-overdone) ways you can show that women were seen as inferior without having them tightlace a corset. but that's coming from someone who's studied the history of dress and fashion in the long eighteenth century. i'm sorry i'm like this!!i will say i appreciated how atmospheric this novel was. i love writing that's descriptive and flowery without dipping too far into purple prose, and there were many scenes where i felt transported back to the grimy, ancient city of edinburgh, which i was able to visit several years ago. hazel was a really believable teen protagonist, all puffed-up with big dreams and lurid fantasies of becoming a living legend, the First Female Physician. the dialogue felt a little too modern for my tastes, but i had to keep consciously reminding myself that this was a YA book for YA readers. the ending felt awfully abrupt, and i feel like there could have been more build-up and foreshadowing to the True Romance: not hazel/jack, but hazel/medicine. i'm not against the ending. but when there was already so much handwaving throughout the entire novel, i don't think it would have detracted much from the message if hazel could have had her cake and eaten it, too. you know? sometimes a girlboss can have a happy ending with her love interest, as a treat.i've probably gone on long enough, so i'll just be brief here: i liked parts of this book. i wanted to like the whole of it. if you're looking for something fun and immersive and slightly spooky and light on the historical accuracy and easy to read, feel free to read this! i'm sure it was written specifically for some people, but it just wasn't for me!
4656295740	Going into this book I knew that it was a YA read- in fact it was Reese Witherspoon’s Winter 2022 YA pick (yes, Reese made me read this-Lol). I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. In fact, the storyline held my interest more than some of the “adult” books that I’ve read lately. Anatomy is described as a gothic love story. I honestly didn’t feel that this story was very “dark” or gothic. I feel that the setting and characters were described perfectly to go along with the story. I loved the character of Hazel Sinnett, and I feel that most women will resonate with her (although back in the late 1800’s, women were not allowed to act or be like Hazel). Before reading this story, I never knew of or even heard of resurrectionists, but apparently it’s a real thing. I learned quite a bit reading this story. I am so happy that I took a chance on reading this book. Oh, and have you had a chance to look at the beautiful cover for this book?! It’s amazingly beautiful! I highly recommend reading this book, whether you are a teenager or a grown adult as I am- trust me, you will enjoy the ‘anatomy’ of this book ;)

5141654890	DNF @56%Обичам книгите за силни героини. Но не и тези за абсурдни и неадекватни героини, защото Хейзъл е точно такава. Тя изобщо не подозира, че живее в началото на 19-ти век!Действието би следвало да се развива през 1817 г., но освен беглото споменаване на Наполеон и “Св. Елена”, няма нищо от тази епоха. За сметка на това викторианският дух е направо задушливо натрапчив. Шуорц изобщо не е успяла да създаде представа за епохата. Езикът от 21-ви век (ръкостискане мъже-жени, минават на малки имена момче и момиче от различни класи още на третия случаен сблъсък, без да са си говорили преди това и т.н.) още повече влошава нещата.Хейзъл от 1817 г. иска да учи медицина и това е най-хубавата част от разказа. Всичко, свързано с анатомията, действително е написано добре. Но абсурдите се редят:⛔️ Хейзъл няма никакъв проблем да си осигури пълна липса на присъствие и надзор и цял замък само на свое разположение. Неомъжено 17-годишно момиче през 1817 г.? Абсурд!⛔️ Хейзъл намира солидна сума пари, за да се запише тайно на курс по анатомия. Няма да повтарям годината, пола и възрастта и - нов абсурд. ⛔️ Хейзъл отива на официален бал на доброто общество без нито един придружител. Хайде да си спомним пак за годината, пола и възрастта и….Феминизмът е хубаво нещо - когато е реален и има истинска база за проява. Шуорц обаче е написала пълна измишльотина, и не е вложила никакъв труд в изграждането на сюжета.Атмосферата всъщност е приятно поднесена на моменти, но героите са истинска трагедия. Ако ставаше дума за презадовлени и невежо самодоволни хлапета в богата държава от 21-ви век не би било проблем, но контрастът с реалностите на наполеоновата епоха е твърде драматичен. А и Джак, ах, Джак - “крада трупове, но пък съм готин, и това крадене всъщност е мега яко!” е цялото му послание. YA просто не е за мен - посланието ми убягва. В случая дори не е забавно и никак не ме интересува какво се случва до края.П. П. Българското издание е красиво оформено и добре преведено. Втората звезда е само заради това.
5842284670	Десь 3.5-4/5Я очікувала більшого, тому трохи розчарувалася. Гейзел - з сім'ї аристократів і планує стати лікаркою, вона дуже наївна і високо літає в мріях, але в 17 років я й сама такою була🤣Джек - викопувач могил. Милий, бідний і працьовитий хлопець🤷. Не знаю, що ще про нього сказати. Було б добре, краще його дізнатися. Мені не вистачило розкриття любовної лінії, от прям мало було. Незважаючи на назву, вона явно тут другорядна. Хотілося більше взаємодій між Гейзел і Джеком, більше розмов, дотиків, флірту хоч чогось. А ще складалося враження, що герої закривали очі на проблеми і робили вигляд, що їх не існує. Про що свідчить ситуація з заручинами. Для мене це виглядало дивно, можливо тому що, мені не подобається оцей стан підвішеності, коли ні туди, ні сюди. Хоча я розуміла їхнє становище, але можна ж було показати, що вони хоча б обговорюють це.Детективна складова тут теж слабенька. Головного антигероя можна відгадати доволі швидко.А ще ця кінцівка.... До чого це було? Я не сперечаюся, було неочікувано, але якось взагалі не клеїться з історією. Мене це ввігнало в ступор і захотілося перевірити жанр книги🤣Але є й плюси. По перше, цікаво написано, читається легко і захоплююче. По друге, гарно зображено становище жінок в ті часи. Коли їх вважали нижчими істотами, здатними лише вийти заміж і народити дітей Їм не дозволялося працювати, навчатися і, навіть, мати власну думку. Жінка повністю залежала від чоловіка, бо без нього вона ніхто. " Будь терпляча, мовчазна вродлива і незаймана, як орхідея, і тоді й лише тоді отримаєш винагороду - скляний ковпак, під яким будеш у безпеці"Як добре, що ми живемо в зовсім інші часи і маємо свободу вибору. Також сподобалася атмосфера: похмурий Единбург, низка смертей, зниклі люди і флірт в розкопаній могилі. Загалом непогано, але трохи суховато. В першу чергу це книга про становище жінок в 19 столітті, про медицину, а вже потім про кохання. Незважаючи, на те, що історія з відкритим фіналом, великого бажання читати наступну в мене немає, але скоріше за все прочитаю, не дарма ж купувала😅
5859882006	«- І скільки ви берете за такі послуги? запитала вона- За тіло?- Коли як. А ви потребуєте тіла?- Ну, коли як, - відказала Гейзел. - Ви здійснюєте доставку?»➖➖➖➖3 мої помилки під час читання: 1. Я думала, що буде історія кохання між доктором та асистентом (це було на стадії купівлі книги. І ні)2. Це буде дуже крінжово (якась магія, але попри реально готичну атмосферу, по типу, перший поцілунок у могилі з тр**аком поряд та досить детальними описами «медичних маніпуляцій» це все було органічно, романтично, гарно та цікаво. І це якась магічна специфіка книги)3. Відсутність магічної складової (вона таки тут була і додала такий прикольний поштовх для наступної книги, що я на стелю лізу від бажання, як хочу її прочитати.)Героїня прекрасна. Діалогів чудові. Здорова, раціональна феміністична складова присутня. Атмосфера фантастична. Історія кохання, сподіваюся буде розкрита у наступній книзі, але тут це далекооо не головне. Я у захваті. І не знаю чому, але під кінець мені вона трошечки стала схожа на серію «Таймлесс». Знаєте, як зі щілини підчас негоди подув такий холодненький, але пронизливий вайб тої історії )))

6949924857	Am ajuns la această carte din curiozitate și nu îmi pare rău delooc. Dacă o carte reușește să îmi facă inima acordeon atunci când o citesc, clar m-a prins. ❤️M-a cucerit scriitura, care curge și te prinde super repede, iar când vrei să o lași din mână, o faci cu regret. Personajele sunt fain construite, vii, iar legătura dintre personajele principale este superbă și delicioasă.Volumul spune povestea unei tinere domnișoare, Hazel, pasionată de anatomie, dar care s-a născut în secolul greșit pentru a reuși să aibă vreo șansă în sfera științelor. Încearcă să ia parte la un curs de anatomie, predat de cel mai prestigios doctor, dar ajunge să fie exclusă. Așa ajunge să accepte provocarea de a învăța singură pentru a se pregăti pentru examenul care ar atesta că este doctor. În încercarea ei de a învăța, îl va cunoaște pe Jack, un recuperator de cadavre. Relația dintre Jack și Hazel a fost foarte fain construită, dialogurile lor au fost delicioase. Mi-au plăcut și parte din personajele secundare, dar deloc, dar deloc de Bernard.Sunt curioasă de continuare, dar și de una dintre cărțile care i-au fost sursă de inspirație autoarei, mai exact ,,Arta măcelăritului".,,Ar trebui să ne temem de bătrânețe maimult decât de moarte."
4180671346	Of course I’d be drawn to a book about a girl dreaming of being a surgeon long before such a thing was thought to be at all possible. It didn’t hurt that the cover of this one is absolutely gorgeous. This book gave me definite Stalking Jack the Ripper vibes although they are both unique stories. Hazel is a 17 year old girl destined to marry her cousin who will be the viscount and secure the family fortune in the family. But Hazel has another dream to be a surgeon. She is determined to take a class on anatomy with the famous Dr. Beecham III. She gets kicked out of class for being a girl but luckily she runs into Jack who steals bodies for medical students. Jack is barely surviving and is supplementing his income with being a ressurectionist (classier name for body thief). The two of them form a sweet friendship and have good chemistry. I devoured this book in pretty much one sitting.
5347827009	O poder do sonho e da coragem na luta de uma mulher pelos seus objetivos numa sociedade trancada e conservadora são o grande mote de Anatomia, Uma História de Amor cujo centro da história vive da perseverança de Hazel em seguir o seu percurso sem que se sinta bloqueada pelos ideais e definições de uma sociedade machista e fechada.Uma história com um bom ritmo, leve e com personagens bem criadas para que o leitor se sinta contagiado pelo amor e dedicação que cada um coloca no que pretende. O final pode deixar algumas marcas para quem gosta do «e viveram felizes para sempre» mas nem mesmo isso acaba por defraudar a imagem geral da história. Recomendo 🫀🥰✨✨

4501839938	It’s the autumn of 1817, our teenage heroine, Hazel, is a smart red-head who lives in a castle. She’s read every medical book in her father’s library and knows how to distinguish the humerus from the femur, but doesn’t know that becoming a female physician – that is a woman who’s a medical professional – is not in her future. And no, before you think something along the lines of, but this girl will use her strong will to show the patriarchy what’s what, forget it. She’s the kind of girl who’s flabbergasted when she find out that her future husband will determine whether she might practice medicine, given that she first has to be allowed to study and pass the exam. Basically, we have a 21st century girl in a 19th century setting.Jack is a dull character. He snatches bodies out of graves and sells them to anatomists. He has a crush on an actress. He snatches bodies out of graves… Oh, I said that already. Well, you get the picture.The pacing of the novel is off. The blurb is a summary of the first 40% of the book. The mystery was a no show until about 75%. Then we get the story going, wrapped up, and a potential sequel hinted at in the remaining quarter.While I was waiting for the (not really baffling) mystery, I realised a lot of inconsistencies with the time and place of the story: ....full review: https://scepticalreading.com/2022/02/...

6267123130	Sometimes a book that might not peak your interest at first will find its way into your hands, given the right time and right obsession. At least, that was the case for me and Anatomy.After several hours of binging (and absolutely losing my mind over) The Artful Dodger (a show I cannot recommend enough. Go watch it! It's perfect), my crave for more similiar stories couldn't be stilled until a friend made me aware of this book. Just like the show, it focuses on surgeries in the 19th century, where surgical theatres were absolutely a thing, and features a female protagonist who is being denied to study the craft due to her one and only sin: her gender. Sprinkle in some romance with a man from a rather low position of society, and we got an intriguing setting, a promsing romance and thrilling plot.And Anatomy delivered in two out of the three categories. Following Hazel as she does everything in her might to study medicine and the art of surgery, going above and beyond to help the ones in need of medical attention that are not able get it elsewhere, while at the same time trying her best to find the one cure that could cure the fever that threatens to come back to the city and take everyone's life just as her brothers, was a delight. Not only did I enjoy Hazel as a protagonist, but I also found myself deeply immersed in her studies and the way medicine and surgery worked back in the 19th century.Adding to that, the narrative and writing which I immediately came to adore. There are many clever quotes in this, and I loved to see articles from academic or journalist texts pop up between chapters to frame the setting and give us a deeper insight into this world.What did hold me back was the romance though. Now, I wasn't primarly here for the romance, so I wasn't too taken aback on the lack of proper development. But since Anatomy is being marketed as a "love story" I did kinda expect more depth in that department. Don't take me wrong, both Hazel and Jack seem to work perfectly together. And I did enjoy that we got a good portion of the book without them interacting as much, and instead, focusing on Hazel taking matters into her own hands to achieve what she desperately wants. (She truly is a girl boss through and through.) But I felt the actual romantic part of it a bit too rushed. Both characters felt too deeply and strongly in a matter of a few paragraphs, and their relationship seemed to progress quite a lot off page which made some on-page-scenes rather disbelieving.Nontheless I was gripped by the whole tale, and surely didn't see that twist coming, while I did have some theories that went into the direction, the gothic outcome was not on my list of possibilities. The ending left me wanting for more while also satisfied enough to not go running to the sequel yet, but I definitely will see myself picking up the final installement of this duology soon, because I have questions, and I truly enjoyed Dana's writing and storytelling.So if you want some historical setting that features surgical theatres, a bit blood and gore, some grave digging and dead bodies, and the big big question of women in science during the 19th century, then pick up Anatomy. However, if you're more inclined to read this for its promised romance, I might warn you that you might not fully come to your cost. (However, it is sweet if that's not your primary interest in the book!)Actual rating: 3.75 stars
6038540565	Mais um livro que transitou de 2023 para 2024 e com um resultado muito positivo. :) 4,5🌟Hazel é uma protagonista muito madura com os seus 17 anos. Quer ser médica num tempo onde as mulheres são educadas e criadas para casar e ter filhos. E que lufada de ar fresco foi esta personagem.Dana Schwartz criou uma história com o essencial: jovem mulher feminista, ambiciosa, com um sonho impossível (ou será mesmo assim?), uma grande dose de conteúdo de medicina, contexto histórico e uma pitada de romance. Já não lia um livro assim há muito tempo, onde o foco é o sonho da personagem e não o romance.Hazel e Jack conhecem-se por uma questão de conveniência e interesse e apesar de surgir algo ali, ela vai sempre lutar para se tornar médica num mundo que pertence aos homens.Com a escrita da autora, conseguimos sentir as emoções das personagens, ver detalhadamente momentos que podem ser cruéis e difíceis, como se estivéssemos no local no momento. Por um lado, não percebo praticamente nada de medicina, mas senti que houve muita pesquisa pela parte da autora relativamente à época onde se passa a história (Escócia, século XIX). Por fim, só houve algumas cenas um pouco inverosímeis no romance, porque sejamos honestos - estão em 1817. Mesmo assim, recomendo esta leitura para quem gostar de um bom young adult e que queira saber um pouco mais sobre a medicina do século XIX.

Beating or still.""Beating or still," she said.“There is no place in our world for a woman to practice medicine, Miss Sinnett. “Song: The Man by Taylor Swift'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man.My first rating was four stars. And I was ok with that. Two days later this book still has an impact on me. Not necessarily because of the story, the plot itself or the characters. But for what this book really represents. It's a love letter to all the young women out there, to all the dreamers, to all the people that have been told to give up. So now it has five stars.**I want to tell you before we start that I included a lot of quotes in my review, because this book simply delivered some of the best quotes I've read in a while.**The charactersHazel SinnettBeing a woman had closed many doors to Hazel Sinnett, but it had also revealed to her a valuable tool in her arsenal: women were almost entirely overlooked as people, which gave her the power of invisibility. People saw women, they saw the dresses women wore on public walks through the park, and the gloved hands they rested on their suitors’ elbows at the theater, but women were never threats. They were never challenges worthy of meaningful considerationThe sad part about this quote is that it's somewhat still relatable. Not how it may have been then, but enough to make me question some things. Hazel is brave enough to stand for what she wants in a world that allows very few to noble women. She chose a difficult profession, one many would fear to do even today. To have the world against you and still fight for love and your aims...She deserves our forever respect.She's book smart, but I wouldn't actually call her street-smart, she had some moments when she was quite naïve. I was frustrated by how many doors wearing a skirt had closed for her. I can't imagine a world like that. “If I may, miss? It's possible that you were a bit, well, harsh with him."Hazel wet her thumb and ran it along a red stain on her leg. It came off. Good. Just dried blood then, and just a little scratch. "Harsh? He's a man, isn't he? He has the entire world at his feet. I think he can handle my turning down a prome- nade."-exactly the point of the book! IT’S THE LESSON YOUNG GIRLS EVERYWHERE were taught their entire lives—don’t be seduced by the men you meet, protect your virtue—until, of course, their entire lives depended on seduction by the right man. It was an impossible situation, a trick of society as a whole: force women to live at the mercy of whichever man wants them but shame them for anything they might do to get a man to want them. Passivity was the ultimate virtue. Heaven forbid you turn into someone like Hyacinth Coldwater. Be patient, be silent, be beautiful and untouched as an orchid, and then and only then will your reward come: a bell jar to keep you safe.How hard it must have been for women back then! I think I finally understood why I couldn't get close to Hazel. Because she's not only one character. She is a voice for all the young women from our history since the beginning. She's all the female main characters that fought for what they wanted. She's every woman that hoped we'll get the right to have jobs, to vote, she's every single girl who's dream was shattered by social norms. She's Cleopatra and the suffragettes, she's every queen and the first female doctor, she's Amelia Earhart, she's Jane Austen and The Bronte sisters, she's Florence Nightingale and Ada Lovelace and more.She's every bright and powerful woman. ✨She's everything.✨JackAnd if she's everything... Well, he's just Ken. He's handsome and kind and loves her and all of that, but he's actually not a big part of the book. I really don't have a lot to say about him. A big round of applause for him for being one of the few nice men this book had, he knew how to respect a woman. Cousin Bernard 🙄🙄🙄I haven't been writing reviews for a long time, but I found that talking about a book or a character you hate it's actually fun. I can't express my love for some of my favourite protagonists, however I found the exact words to describe my hatred. Anyways, cousin Bernard 🙄🙄🙄 (no, I can't mention his name without three eye roll emojis, thank you very much). In my time as a reader I came across lots of dumb characters. Oh, cousin Bernard 🙄🙄🙄 is a special subject. One that deserves to be studied 😉. The anatomy of cousin Bernard 🙄🙄🙄(or the recipe of how to turn a nice boy into a jerk) :We have a very nice, kind little kid who supports his cousin. They play together and he doesn't mind that she's not like the other girls. Add a few years and an education in the eighteen hundreds while surrounding him with men that think women are simply beautiful objects with no brain whatsoever. 🤢 To give you an example of a "gentleman's", his father, quote:"Some women," Lord Almont said to his son, "have yet to learn that we enjoy looking at them more than listening to them."Then, for a bit of seasoning, make him feel smart. Like, give him that feeling he can't be tricked (spoiler alert, I saw children that are more clever). Make him puff his chest whenever you agree with him. Make him obsessed with a certain girl. Not in a good way. Make him jealous enough to cause terrible things because who cares if the girl doesn't want to be his. She's his property, how dare you argue with him? Oh, and don't forget to give him an ego as big as his fortune and a common sense as small as his brain. There you have it : a dumb young man, no, frankly a very stupid young man(making him young it's actually even worse-how will he be at fifty??? ), self-absorbed(you peasants don't see he's the centre of the universe?🙄) who was nice to start with, but becomes like any other men in his time period and tries to crush his cousin aka. future wife's dreams because being a physician it's not a ladylike thing. Dear Bernard, be thankful you don't live in this time period, because I'd have some things to say to you, you little... How can a sweet child change so much... I'm surprised Hazel hasn't punched you yet (there's another book left and if she doesn't, I know a person or two who would gladly join me to teach you to respect women that are smart, powerful and have a determination your narrow mind could never understand.) Let me tell you Bernard : we have souls, we have beauty, we have minds, we have dreams and goals, but most importantly, we are unstoppable. (unlike you who I bet can be stopped by a door because you don't know how to open it without a servant). Moving on to another messed-up character: the mom.Let's not take into consideration she ignores her daughter being more preoccupied with her son (cuz he's the heir, not a pretty girl, the most important thing she'll do in life is to get married, duh 🙄). You saw how her behaviour changed after a specific moment? How she added words such as "darling" and "adoring mother" to her letters? Do I have anything else to say? No, I do not. The menYes, men in general, since I found out the depictions of men in this book are interesting to say the least, brutality correct and honest, fun and relatable almost to this day. (they don't apply to all men, but you get my point) Some quotes for you to make an idea:The men were distracted by their own importance, and not one would have thought to look at anyone who happened to be standing a centimeter below his own eyeline.No doubt all of the swooning made the men around them feel so useful and strong, to be able to lift a woman up from a heap among her skirts and fan her face until her eyelashes blink back to consciousness.To be completely honest, I couldn't get really attached to the characters. I tried, but I couldn't. That's my only regret. The love story itself it's beautiful, it's heartwarming and heartbreaking, it's that once in a lifetime love, the one you are willing to leave it all behind for, it's definitely worth reading.Still, I didn't get quite that emotional as I would've wanted because of my situation with the characters. I relate to Hazel a lot, but only at a superficial level somehow, I understand her, yet I can't get close. Does that even make sense? I guessed the plot twists a hundred pages in, there aren't a lot of things happening, it's not very fast paced , as I said in the book it's not the best for the plot, but for the impact it has on you. The relationship 💕I can't talk too much about it without any spoilers, so I picked a few of my favourite quotes:They were there, together. Whatever-whoever-was out there, neither of them would have to face it alone.No one has ever told me that I'm beautiful before," Hazel said. She hadn't realized it was true until she said it out loud.Jack stood with his hands on either side of her face and stared at her for a few heartbeats. Then he leaned in and softly kissed both her eyelids."Someone should tell you that you're beautiful every time the sun comes up. Someone should tell you you're beautiful on Wednesdays. And at teatime. Someone should tell you you're beautiful on Christmas Day and Christmas Eve and the evening before Christmas Eve, and on Easter. He should tell you on Guy Fawkes Night and on New Year's, and on the eighth of August, just because." He kissed her lips once more, gently, and then pulled away and gazed into her eyes."Hazel Sinnett, you are the most miraculous creature I have ever come across, and I am going to be thinking about how beautiful you are until the day I die.”❤️❤️❤️The medical part 💉 If you're going to med school read this book. This is probably the first book I've read that talked so much about medical procedures. I can confirm. Theory is one thing, but practising on a real body is like entering a whole new universe. The drawings are perfect, but each human body is unique. I was really involved in each medical description. I loved them!Any physician who wishes to effectively treat either disease or any variety of common household injury must first under- stand anatomy. An understanding of the human body and all of its component parts is elemental to our profession.The physician works with his mind. The surgeon works with his hands, and his brute strength.Morte magis metuenda senectus. "Old age should rather be feared than death." "Mortui vivos docent" - "The dead teach the living." The aesthetic 🍂🍁The aesthetic of this book it's just perfect. You have descriptions of chilly September and October mornings, how Hazel sees the town waking up from her window while reading a book.It's great to read it this fall. It's a bit of a thriller, perhaps even a horror book if you are not that comfortable with surgeries (nothing in too many details though), I am so it didn't matter that much, and of course it has a love story.Did I love this book when I first read it? Not exactly. It somehow grew on me for the past few days. Isn't that what a great book really means? A story that makes you think for a while.Sure it might not have been perfect, but it will leave a permeate mark on me.💓This is probably one of the longest reviews I've ever wrote.To every young woman, actually to every person out there who has a dream. Don't give up. Never. After all, those are your wings. You decide how high you fly.Happy reading! ❤️
4027628019	** spoiler alert ** 3.5⭐️I was immediately interested in this one because of the promise of a dark/gothic setting and content. The premise reminded me a lot of Stalking Jack the Ripper which I really enjoyed but Anatomy: A Love Story was just okay for me. Most of the plot progressed pretty slowly and then the ending get super rushed. The posted synopsis covered the whole plot basically all the way through the first 30% so for basically 100 pages of the book I was just waiting for her to get kicked out of the anatomy class and for the conflict to actually begin. The romance was nice, it didn’t completely pull me in but I did like that added plot line. I could appreciate Hazel and her independence. She wanted to break out of the mold and do something that everyone told her she wasn’t allowed to do just because she was a girl. I definitely enjoyed following her opening up her own makeshift hospital in her home and being so determined to become a physician. I feel like there were loose ends that weren’t tied up like Dr. Beecham just got to keep murdering people and taking their body parts with no consequence. I didn’t mind Hazel and Jack’s story being a bit more open ended but it would have been nice to see some consequences for the ultimate villain of the book after the mystery was solved. I ended up liking the idea of this one a lot more than the execution but I still think it was a worthwhile read with good writing and an atmospheric setting. Thank you to NetGalley, the author and the publisher for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
4405836117	I've had this book sitting on my TBR since it's release... I think I kept skipping over it because I was afraid it was going to be boring. I was right.Love the idea behind the story, unfortunately it was slow and uninteresting. The ending picked up, but that only earned it another 1/4 of a star. I don't think I'll be reading the sequel.3.25 stars

5129255821	3,5 - 4 Sterne 🌟 Die Geschichte ist wirklich außergewöhnlich. Mir hat aber noch ein kleiner Funke gefehlt, damit sie mich komplett begeistert. Ich habe auch ein paar Kritik Punkte an der Handlung selbst, die für mich nicht so viel Sinn gemacht haben. Alles in allem ist es aber ein spannender historischer Roman mit einem Touch suspense, einer Liebesgeschichte und einer Protagonistin die weiß was sie will. 🥰
5033075616	Paaa...to je bilo razočaravajuće. Ako vam se nije dopala Mexican Gothic, neće ni ovo, odmah da vam kažem. Fantastičan momenat na kraju knjige je upropastio celu knjigu. S tim što se meni dopala pomenuta knjiga, ali ona je od početka obećavala horor, dok je ovo više ličilo na mračnu dramu koja je mogla da bude fenomenalna.Mnogo mi se dopala glavna junakinja. Zamislite devojku na kraju 18. veka koja želi da bude doktor. To je vreme kada su doktori krišom otkupljivali leševe kako bi učili na njima, i vreme u koje žene nisu smele ni da sanjaju da budu doktori. Glavna junakinja upoznaje dečka koji otkopava tela i na njima uči. Sve to mi je bilo mnogo zanimljivo, ali onda stiže kraj koji uništava celu knjigu. Očigledno je da autorka nije imala pojma šta želi da uradi s premisom. Šteta!
5876935658	це було максимально швидке читання (2 дні, камон), бо моя подруга постійно мене підганяла (Софія, дякую безмежно) і я просто не можу передати свого захвату від книгимене так захопив сюжет, що я буквально не відривалась від книги доки не дочитала її…в мене давно такого не було чесно кажучи, я досить скептично ставилась до любовної лінії на початку, але вона досить гарно потім вплелась в сюжет, але справжня любов, то звісно головна героїня Гейзел просто неймовірна дівчина я хвилювалась за неї, наче це моя найближча подруга (а таке в мене буває не часто)чудова книга (а я ще сумнівалась чи варто її купувати) і я просто кажу всім, хто все ще в роздумах чи потрібен вам цей романповірте, точно потрібен з нетерпінням чекаю на продовження 💖
