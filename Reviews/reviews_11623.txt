33056960	The Problem of Sylvia Plath, Her Poetry, and the Necessity of Her JournalsBecause of her suicide at the age of 30, many critics have labeled her either immature or hysterical--while other critics have taken it upon themselves to defend her integrity. Those who have championed her work find they do so at personal cost. Unfortunately, her personal life, and the circumstances surrounding her death have had an adverse effect on how she is read.Quite instinctively, one knows the implications that may be drawn when acknowledging a liking for her poetry. By announcing your admiration for Plath, you may find yourself under suspicion for morbidity, bad taste, and even doctrinaire feminism.However, if you believe Plath is one of the more important poets of the 20th century and that she's had a lasting effect on lyric poetry, one cannot deny the import of her work. Although, beware, her work is seen through many lenses. Even admiring lenses can cloud one's judgment. Many admirers make the mistake of imagining Plath to be a Phaedra--a spurned woman, a dangerous woman, and a victim. But the speaker in her poetry is just as multidimensional as Plath was herself. Despite the fact that she wrote from the emotional realities of her life, one cannot stress enough, how important it is to separate the person from the creative result. It is because of this confusion between the two, that the Unabridged Journals bear the burden of illumination. They are a significant contribution to our understanding of Plath and Plath scholarship.The journals allow us to see Plath’s joyful, backbreaking work. They allow us to see the methodical revisions, the many thoughtful ways in which she crafted her poems. They allow us to see the seams and underpinnings necessary in the making of lasting poetry.Though Plath's sensibility is dark, and though she twists nature to her own effect, like so many other poets and fiction writers, there is something uncommon about her work and the strength and momentum that builds poem-to-poem. There is a forcefulness of the persona speaking through her work, and then too, there is her strong inclination toward wholeness and harmony; although, many only see the jaded and sardonic undercurrents.Yet, one of the most important aspects of her work, an aspect that has often been neglected, has to do with the idea of the spirit derailed from its source, and how that spirit is always trying to find its way back to the source. The speaker is constantly in flight, searching for a means of return. This is the dilemma of the soul. It is the dilemma of the artist in his or her calling, and that spiritual pull between the real world and the state of imagining which becomes, through physical and mental exertion, its own state. It is because of this that I maintain that Plath was brilliant and that she created her final poems with genius. Her final book, known as Ariel, was a swift achievement. Many of the poems written in the final months of her life were characterized by a propulsion, or forward momentum, a gallop toward an end. Like Shakespeare’s Ariel, the spirit of Plath’s work appears to be driven toward an understanding of enslavement and the necessity of freedom. The work speaks to the alchemy of person-hood and art formation. For Plath, this was a quest for liberation, and a means to end her suffering. There is a dichotomy between the mechanical and mathematical aspects of poetry and something outside reason. Plath merges form with associative lyricism until the scaffolding of her old style falls away and we are left with Ariel.To know Plath more closely, one may want to read her journals. They give the reader a glimpse into the ways she worked and into the associative powers of her mind. The journals allow the reader to separate the person from the persona. It gives a sense of the ordinary, and humanizes the writer. One sees the struggles she endured, in her daily life, as an imperfect person in the pursuit of her art. And it is "One Art," like Bishop's art, in its own way, so precisely crafted and yet as soon as it is mastered—lost. Unfortunately, some of her journals went missing or were destroyed. But the journals that remain allow a close reader to see some of her ideas before they appeared in print. They give a sense to how she may have approached her work. There is no doubt Sylvia Plath's art was a labor of love. Her euphoria and intensity in the creating of it is tangible. It is important to read the journals, and her poetry as it is appears on the page, and to remember, all art is artifice. All true artists create not just a world, but a mythology within which they exist. Although Plath's mythology may at times be off-putting due to a kind of forcefulness and rancor, it is a distinct voice full of human emotion. The world she creates is recognizable, but only as far as a dream may be recognizable. In truth, what we encounter cannot be Plath herself. Her final poetry is a brilliant invention, prepared by a writer in pursuit of her very best. It is a visionary form: a reality that seems more real, only because of its extreme divergence. Great poets trick their listeners and readers by making the art form feel more real. Perhaps this was her “call,” as Sylvia Plath said so herself. But the call of the reader is to recognize the trick and then to commend the art for brilliant illusions.
1227069358	I decided I was going to read this for two reasons: Sylvia Plath intrigued me; and I need to write better journal entries.It is sometimes hard to wrap your head around the fact that she was so young when she wrote those journals, and constantly I had to keep reminding myself. She seemed extremely mature for her age. I found myself only reading 20, 30 pages at a time, because her words were so full of introspection, I had to continually go back and reread passages and reflect, soul-search about my own life. It was exhausting (and worthwhile).The first half of this book is absolutely remarkable. Especially for being just a journal. After she married, however, I think her tone changed. Her journaling was permanently altered. She made herself so little when compared to the “great Ted Hughes”. She refrained from “nagging” him, but he could nag her, because of his “superior seat”. Out of the pair he was always the better, bigger and smarter in her eyes. Her feminist words of before were somehow not put into action, and she became rather submissive and accepting too much of his behavior and betrayals. I understand her position and era of misogyny, but after being so entirely compelled by this woman’s words, I can’t lie here and say her submission didn’t bother me.The introspection halted and her diaries started resembling a drone list of clipped everyday happenings and to-do lists. The student Sylvia was interesting, incredibly eloquent and contemplative; alive and iridescent, even at her worst depressions. The working, married Sylvia was washed out and colorless. But that’s when she wrote her most important masterpieces. So I suppose she just transplanted her magic from journaling to higher purposes.This book was a long, tough read. Took me forever to finish. But it was more than worth it. Sylvia Plath was something else. Her words transcend journaling.

2361473371	wow, I guess I really took my time to finish this book. no, I mean... I reaAAAlly took my time – Goodreads is telling me I started reading it in April 2018, and have only managed to finish it in August 2020; and what a ride this has been!! honestly, I can't deny my disappointment at realising how much of her journals has been lost, possibly forever (Ted Hughes claims to have destroyed the last volume, but then again, Sylvia also went through periods when she simply didn't keep a diary). reading her journals has been...exhausting, above all. I could only pick this up when feeling especially depressed, since her journals would get quite intense at times. However, most of all, Sylvia kept a diary as a writing exercise – this is why you'll have to go through hundreds of pages where nothing's really happening (but in a somewhat pretentious way and gorgeously written, still).all in all, I'd say that it was worth spending 2 years intermittently picking up her journals for the few insightful, emotional entries describing her anxieties as an aspiring author, her relationship with Ted, her deepest insecurities and her battle with depression (which she eventually lost). and yeah, Sylvia totally made me want to start keeping a diary – if only I weren't so afraid that I'd unconsciously appropriate her voice, then defeating the whole purpose.Saturday: July 19, 1958. Paralysis still with me. It is as if my mind stopped & let the phenomena of nature-shiny green rosebugs and orange toadstools & screaking woodpeckers – roll over me like a juggernaut – as if I had to plunge to the bottom of non-existence, of absolute fear, before I can rise again. My worst habit is my fear & my destructive rationalizing. Suddenly my life which always had clearly defined immediate & long-range objectives – a Smith scholarship, a Smith degree, a won poetry or story contest, a Fullbright, a Europe trip, a lover, a husband – has, or appears to have none. I dimly would like to write (or is it to have written?) a novel, short stories, a book of poems. And fearfully, dimly, would like to have a child: a bloodily breached twenty-year plan of purpose. Lines occur to me & stop dead: "The tiger lily's spotted throat". And then it is an echo of Eliot's "The tiger in the tiger pit", to the syllable & the consonance. I observe: "The mullberry berries redden under leaves". And stop. I think the worst thing is to exteriorize these jitterings & so will try to shut up & not blither to Ted. His sympathy is a constant temptation. I am made to be busy, gay, doing crazy jobs & writing this & that – stories & poems & nursing babies. How to catapult myself into this? When I stop, moving, other lives & single-track aims shoulder me into shadow. [...] Will this pass like a sickness? If I don't settle my trouble from within, no outside shower of fortune will make the grass grow. I feel under opiates, hashish – heavy with paralysis – all objects slipping from numb fingers, as in a bad dream. b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l.

3215941881	my first ever encounter with Sylvia Plath was with her poem 'Daddy' - // bit my pretty red heart in two.I was ten when they buried you. At twenty I tried to dieAnd get back, back, back to you.I thought even the bones would do.But they pulled me out of the sack, And they stuck me together with glue. //I couldn't understand at that time why I was able to connect with her, but some time later when I was in my own labyrinth I was able to comprehend the attachment I formed with her. In some really severe hopeless moments, I found solace in the words of the person who, like everyone around us, was thrown into the real world with a really brute force. But unlike everyone else, it took her, and to some extent, me, years to find a stable ground. When everyone around was growing with a pace that seemed unattainable to me, there I was - with Sylvia, stuck in a world where we were convinced that the only way to live was by being hard on ourselves. She taught me how to reflect on myself and my thoughts, and slowly I found myself getting out of the bell jar. I don't know if I found her or if she found me, all I know is that we have always belonged together. They say that you're an amalgamation of all the books you read, but of all the authors I've ever read she's the one I feel the most myself with. she died when she was 30. She committed suicide by suffocating herself to death. She couldn't find her own ability to stand up, but she helped me find mine. a book that I revisit every year.

27371941	This is the book that introduced me to Sylvia Plath. Her poetry and 'The Bell Jar' would follow. I came to appreciate her love for just writing. She can make the most mundane interesting. To truly have a complete picture of Sylvia Plath, 'The Journals' are integral. One of my great thrills was to visit Smith College, and meet Karen Kukil and actually pick up and read the actual journals. In the Mortimer rare book room, I was also able to see the drafts of her poems written on the pink Smith College stationary. To read the Journals for me was to get closer to the real Sylvia Plath, and away from the sensationalized version. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Sylvia Plath.
5304999013	“I don’t believe in God as a kind father in the sky. I don’t believe that the meek will inherit the earth. The meek get ignored and trampled. They decompose in the bloody soil of war, of business, of art, and they rot into the warm ground under the spring rains.”An unabridged collection of Sylvia Plath’s personal journals. Even at 700+ pages this 6 pound doorstop of a book still has waning gaps of missing time—missing because her journaling was inconsistent, missing because of her hospitalization after a failed suicide attempt (1953), missing because Ted Hughes “lost” at least one journal, missing because Ted Hughes burned her final journal. The editors have done their absolute best to bridge the holes with letters (when available), journal “fragments,” footnotes and a rather extensive appendix. Still, it would be to the reader’s benefit to have a bit of background knowledge about Plath’s life history before tackling this behemoth.I’m struck by the extent of Sylvia’s crippling codependency with Hughes. There is a distinct change in the tone of her writing once the handsome and talented T.H. enters her sphere of existence. Her focus becomes noticeably less about bettering herself as a poet and a writer and noticeably more about managing and furthering Ted’s career. I’m not suggesting he would have floundered without her, I’m just saying that… well… even though Plath rarely disparages his character, he still comes off looking like a complete asshole.

3042615442	Nigdy w życiu nie czytałam żadnej książki tak długo, ale trudnością nie była wcale objętość „Dzienników”, a raczej mnogość akapitów wymagających czasu i porządnego przemyślenia. Początkowe wpisy to głównie rozważania na temat wyboru tej jednej „słusznej” życiowej drogi, opisy miłosnych przygód Sylvii Plath i jej wielkich ambicji. Im dalej w treść, tym bardziej koncentrujemy się na pisaniu, które w pewnym momencie zmienia się w obsesję autorki. Dostajemy zatem ogromne ściany tekstu przepełnione opisami zwykłych przedmiotów, szkice nigdy nieukończonych powieści, długie listy imion, które Plath chciała nadać bohaterom swoich kolejnych tekstów. Łatwo się tą książką zachwycić, ale łatwo też poczuć się znużonym. Zdumiewające są jednak umiejętności pisarskie Plath, szczególnie biorąc uwagę, że były to jej prywatne zapiski tworzone w czasach, kiedy nie była jeszcze znana. Kto powinien sobie tę książkę odpuścić? Przede wszystkim ci, którzy spodziewają się odnalezienia w niej sensacji związanych z licznymi próbami samobójczymi autorki czy rozpadem jej małżeństwa. Zaskakująco mało jest w tej książce tematów potencjalnie kontrowersyjnych, jest za to bardzo dużo feminizmu i rzadko spotykanej wrażliwości. A komu spodoba się najbardziej? Tym, którzy chcieliby zajrzeć do głowy jednej z najlepszych i jednocześnie najbardziej tajemniczych pisarek ubiegłego wieku i tym, którzy będą potrafili zrozumieć jej potrzebę kompulsywnego pisania o wszystkim, nawet o tym, co może wydawać się nieistotne.

62651243	This is a book that would probably be best read the way it was written, a page or two at a time over a period of years. Roughly 700 pages at one gulp can be an overdose. Plath is a good writer and a perceptive and intelligent woman, but living inside her head for very long isn't comfortable even for an observer. Knowing the ending in advance, of course, gives the reader an edge on Plath and adds an unintended layer of irony to many entries and an involuntary little shiver to comments like "I desire the things which will destroy me in the end."
3078472005	When you hear the name Sylvia Plath two things instantly come to mind. The first thing being her suicide and the second thing being her contributions to the world of writing. I went back and forth on how to best state the first thing and decided to go with the blunt truth of it. I know that word carries a lot of pain and for some people it is a topic they prefer to avoid. If you are one of those people I recommend walking away from this review. There is no plan to dig into the topic but there might be a mention of it here and there since it did weigh heavily on my mind as I read her journals.This is a collection of journals written by a young woman just trying to exist in this crazy world. I was surprised by how long it took me to read it. The length can be blamed for some of it but most of the blame should go to the content. So much raw emotion buried in the pages mixed with an eerie detachment and an almost business-like edge to compartmentalize her own life into goals. I found it difficult to go between the extremes. One minute I was drooling over a meal she had deliciously described and the next I was lost in a fog of anguish brought on by her desire to be in a relationship she couldn’t make happen. Then a few pages later I would find myself reading her list out her short-term goals and how they had to be met so she could reach and accomplish her long-term goals. What would come after that would be her rapid decline into self-loathing for not meeting her goals and then swiftly back to describing a gorgeous view or a detailed interaction with an interesting person she met in passing.I spent a lot of time in between these dips and dives pondering how they came to be. I feel strongly that is how Plath’s mind worked and I can relate on some level to it. Some days I wake in a get shit done mood and others I am more focused on just being, which means drifting from thought to thought and randomly focusing on minute details of inconsequential things. I think this is truly why I was so bothered by this book and why I had to work slowly through her journal entries. To tear yourself down for not meeting goals is one thing, to see another person doing it to themselves is quite another. The other reason for it being here and there, I felt had to do with what content was provided to the reader. I don’t believe the author of this book cherry-picked it, but I do believe Plath’s husband did. The author does mention that some journals were missing/destroyed, and I think if the man did that to some then he had the power to alter the content of others. I think we will never truly grasp the full picture of what all she experienced and how she felt about it and honestly, I think that is okay. There are certain bits of our lives that should remain our business only. I will admit that while reading her journals I did feel the same bit of guilt I felt when reading what Kurt Cobain left behind. Not enough to stop though, and that is my little shame demon to deal with.The fact that she is mostly known for the first thing is unfortunate because her talent was her true shining light. I can't even begin to express how much I am in awe of her abilities. She could string common and obscure words together in such unique and thought-provoking ways. She could thoroughly describe the condition of a room, a gut-wrenching emotional response to a moment or a love for picking her nose, with equal amounts of respect for it or the experience of it. She was a powerhouse wordsmith and the world suffered more than we will ever know with her loss.Four star to a book that will forever live in my memory.
3759593895	To był mój całoroczny projekt czytelniczy, który udało mi się z powodzeniem i zadowoleniem skończyć. Bardzo lubię czytać dzienniki, a w tych podobało mi się wiele rzeczy: to jak krytyczna jest Plath, jak szuka siebie, jak błądzi. Niezwykle dojrzałe są te jej zapiski, jej samodyscyplina jednocześnie mnie przerażała i budziła mój podziw. Tak się akurat złożyło, że w pewnym czasie czytałam jednocześnie Dzienniki i "Mistykę kobiecości". Niesamowite odnajdywać w przemyśleniach młodej Plath to o czym później pisała Betty Friedan w skali całego pokolenia kobiet takich, jak Plath. Ta presja społeczna, którą Plath czuje, to jak próbuje się wyrwać, a jednocześnie chce trzymać się utartych dla kobiet ścieżek zarówno w niej jak i we mnie podczas lektury budziła frustrację i poczucie niesprawiedliwości. Polecam wszystkim fankom dzienników, zainteresowanym literaturą, procesem twórczym, walką z oczekiwaniami.
4363461	it is a chilling experience to read this. if you keep a journal of your own you probably understand how odd it is to imagine people around the world curling up with it/them. i am a self-admitted voyeur so i couldn't resist this glimpse into her mind. as always, ted had a say in what we (and more importantly, her children) would know of her:"I destroyed [the last of her journals] because I did not want her children to have read it (in those days I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival)"yes, it is disappointing to know those words are forever lost. fortunately she has other ways of guiding us through the darkest portals of her mind, and i am grateful for the challenge of the journey.

7117662936	“I have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad. Or I can go mad by ricocheting in between.”I didn't expect this to be so vivid, raw, and honestly relatable. Sylvia Plath is so good with words. The way she writes about life, love, her desires, the future, and just general existence is both delicate and authentic. Please read this book.
2009182545	So prior to reading the Journals, my general estimation of Plath's work was roughly:5 stars = Ariel (1962-1963)4 stars = Bell Jar (1959-1961) + the 1961-1962 poetry not gathered in Ariel3 stars = the 1958-1960 poetry (Colossus etc.)2 stars = Johnny Panic stories + pre-1958 poetry1 star = early fictionMost of the Journals were written before Plath's earliest publications -- they abruptly end in 1959, though a couple appendices have brief bits of prose from later years -- with no diaristic material written during her objectively best period of work (late 1962 / early 1963, before her death). Given that roughly half of this book consists of Plath's journals from 1951 to 1957 (age 17 to 23), and given that it's extremely rare for anyone to be a truly talented writer at age 17 -- it's a very short list; David Hume? Jane Austen? Mary Shelley? Nietzsche? -- I figured the Journals would be somewhat of a slog, with occasional good passages, maybe some interesting autobiographical material, a bit of insight into her middle-period poetry, etc. In short, my expectations for the Journals were not too high, given that Plath's early fiction/poetry are good but not great. (Not that there's anything wrong with that -- she is in fact in good company, as the early fiction/poetry of, e.g., Joyce and Proust are mediocre at best.) I had briefly skimmed the Journals here and there, years ago, but didn't get around to finishing them until I worked through almost everything else on my to-read list.Anyway it turns out that I was completely wrong: Sylvia Plath is among the most talented 17-year-old prose writers in the history of the English language (?!), and then still world-class as she entered her twenties. My main reaction was confusion, honestly; I am sincerely, truly confused as to why her early prose/poetry is so mediocre, if she was always capable of writing prose at this level . . . she mainly reminded me of early Gaddis, peak Joyce, TSE's poetry, etc. (We also learn from the Journals that Plath's taste in poets and novelists is basically perfect -- by which I mean, roughly identical to mine, I guess? lol. She was appropriately obsessed with Ulysses and you can see her prose style shift in a clearly Joycean direction after a semester spent reading his novels as an undergraduate.) It was also curious to realize that Plath not only reminded me of Gaddis but is in fact in Gaddis's generation; somehow, in my head, she was frozen in time at age 31 and thus eternally young, but of course Plath was born in the early 1930s, nine years after Gaddis (and four years before DeLillo, with whom she shares similar obsessions; death, the Holocaust, the post-WW2 moral landscape, etc.). Her prose style is just so mystifying insofar as her other published fiction/prose is so 'safe', so polished . . . you would never know, would never suspect, that the author of The Bell Jar was capable of Gaddis-Recognitions-level prose in 1951. Just to give an example, this is what a 17-year-old Sylvia Plath wrote while sleepy at 1 a.m. one night in July 1950, a tossed-off first draft, without revising or thinking about publication etc.:I came out of the house-across-the-street a little before twelve, sick with unfulfilled longing, alone, self-reviling. And there, miraculously was the August night. It had just rained, and the air was thick with warm damp and fog. The moon, full, pregnant with light, showed strangely from behind the small frequent clouds, poised like a picture puzzle that had been broken, with light in back, outlining each piece. There seemed to be no wind, but the leaves of the trees stirred, restless, and the water fell from them in great drops on the pavement, with a sound like that of people walking down the street. There was the peculiar smell of mold, dead leaves, decay, in the air. The two lights over the front steps were haloed with a hazy nimbus of mist, and strange insects fluttered up against the screen, fragile, wing-thin and blinded, dazed, numbed by the brilliance. Lightning, heat lightning flicked off and on, as if some stage hand were toying with the light switch. Two crickets, deep in the cracks in the granite steps, sang a sweet, haunting-thin trill. And because it was my home, I loved them. The air flowed about me like thick molasses, and the shadows from the moon and street lamp split like schizophrenic blue phantoms, grotesque and faintly repetitious.To be clear, I'm not saying that her prose is perfect -- it's a little raw, a bit pretentious, over-exuberant, sure -- but what the heck lol. It was also always a bit jarring to see, e.g., an entry about making "a good tuna-fish salad" with the girls in her dorm (as a sophomore at Smith College, at age 19), followed immediately thereafter by:Beat on the tin roofs with spears of rain, lord. Harry the steel cities with claps of thunder. Fling, fling thy light crackling across the face of the stone skytowers. They will hear not, they will see not, neither will they understand. For they have built the walls of their citadels of steel, and their temples of rock, and they dwell within. Also have they lit the dark with colored neons, and the streets are lanced with shooting stars. More loudly known, oh lord; with thy clarion blast flare awful at the gates. Light, oh lord, sear white throbs and crack the skies; they will not hear. Vain flash the proud lights in the city of man, red, blue, green and yellow and white. Colors of apple, color of grape, of pear, of corn. Clear flash the proud lights, lord, and your far wheeling beacons pale, those far fixed stars, and the planets withered, shrunken, twirl in their forgotten orbits, pale, lord, in the light-bleached sky. In the white cold glare from the city of man. Ride in the sun crashing light victorious or hold back your rain. Cry in anger or in sorrow at the lost world, the mistaken ones. They are working. They will have you yet in harness.Wandering in a desperate purgatory with a gray man in a gray boat in a gray river; an apathetic Charon dawdling upon a passionless phlegmatic River Styx, and a petultant Christ child bawling on the train . . . the orange sun was a flat pasted disc on a smoky, acrid sky. Hell was the Grand Central subway on Sunday morning. And I was doomed to burn in ice, numb, cold, revolving in crystal, neutral, passive vacuums, void of sensation.. . . followed immediately by a journal entry describing a lame date she went on. This woman is truly something else.All I can figure, as we can piece together from the Journals and from what I've read elsewhere, was that Plath saw this style as more 'private' . . . she wanted to be as safe/publishable as possible in her work, and was (as we can see from the Journals) palpably anxious to conform to the standards of the New Yorker and 'the slicks'; she wanted to be published and wanted to have status in that way, and thus felt that she couldn't risk the wildness of her actual/best prose. (In 1957 she describes her non-journal prose/poetry as "brittle, stilted artificial stuff, not touching on my deep self"). It was really only in 1962 -- partially due to reading the confessional poetry of Lowell and Sexton -- that Plath had the confidence/impatience to let all inhibitions go and write what she was actually capable of, and thus we have Ariel, easily one of the best series of poems written in the twentieth century. But the astonishing thing is that her talent was already there -- albeit in a raw/uneven, but in some ways more engaging, form -- at age 17. Entirely apart from the world-class prose, which is among the best nonfiction published in the twentieth century, the Journals also work at a meta-literary and dramatic-irony-esque level for anyone who is familiar with Plath's other work, with Hughes's poetry, with the standard biographies etc. I was also a bit surprised to find out that the tedious second-wave feminism stuff wasn't entirely projected onto Plath's work after her death; Plath is obviously waaaaaaay more intelligent and multivalent than all the boring feminists who made her the avatar of their political movement (similar to Cindy Sherman vs. all the photographers influenced by her), but it's not wrong to say that Plath was a proto-feminist in some ways.Each phase of the Journals is also compelling in its own way; Plath's exuberant final high school summer and first year of college have a very different 'feel' from her middle years of college, which abruptly end with her suicide attempt in Summer 1953. The reader can see the steps leading up to the depressive episode in 1952 and early 1953, but there's an unintentionally artful/dramatic break where the reader is forced to fill in the gaps as the narrative suddenly resumes in late 1955. Yet Plath's pre-Hughes entries (in England) are also worthwhile in their own right; while these are probably the weakest couple years of writing, it's interesting to see her prose become darker, with more layers being added to the person that we've seen grow up since age 17 . . . and then she's suddenly married (just 3-4 months after meeting Ted Hughes) and becomes curiously proud/arrogant, jealous of other female poets, self-doubting and competitive (to be fair, she was only 25), etc. Probably the most valuable aspect of the Journals was just understanding Plath and her work better; I've read the biographies and her published work but definitely feel that I didn't completely 'get' Plath until now, the Journals remove the opacity from her other work. The post-marriage phase is also intriguing in that Plath is less confessional, less autobiographical -- once you have a husband to talk to, journals are perhaps no longer necessary in that sense! -- but showcases her developing talent in both poetry and prose . . . the Journals become more of a prose sketchbook, and are compelling in a whole new way (quite different from her earlier prose, which is equally good), e.g.:Two poplar trees, green & orange striped awnings. I never learned to look at details. Recreate life lived: that is renewed life. The incident goes down, a grit in the eye of god, and is wept forth a hundred years and a day hence, a globed iridescent pearl world - turn the glass globe and the snow falls slowly through ronds of quartz air. Pellets of fact drop into the mind's glass of clear liquor and unfold petal by petal, red, blue, green, or pink and white - paper flowers creating the illusion of a world. Every world crowns its own kings, laurels its own gods. A Hans Andersen book cover opens its worlds: the snowqueen, bluewhite as ice, flies in a sleigh through her snow-thick air: our hearts are ice. Always: sludge, offal, shit against palaces of diamond. That man could ream god and heaven: how mud labors. We burn in our own fire. And the horror: the strange bird who knows Longfellow, perches on a wire with a backdrop of English green-bushed landscapes. The white-bearded grandfather drowning in the sea-surge, the warm, slow, sticky rollers; the terror of paper crackling & expanding before the burnt-out black grate; whence these images, these dreams? Worlds shut-off by car-bustle, calendar-dictation. A world hung in a Christmas ornament, washed gilt, a world silvered & distended in the belly of my pewter teapot: open Alice's door, work & sweat to pry open gates & speak out words & worlds.It's also fascinating to see Plath's personality coalescing into stability as she's preparing to have children, finally getting published (beyond occasional pieces in college), settling into something approaching normality, but there's more dramatic irony in that the reader obviously picks up on various foreshadowings of her eventual separation from Ted Hughes (due to his adultery) and subsequent suicide. We can see -- we have seen! since age 17 -- the intense jealousy Plath feels toward other women (both sexually and professionally), we've seen her obsessive and self-admittedly unhealthy neediness for a father/male figure along with her intense rejection/hatred of men (at times, with previous lovers etc.), her strong independent streak coupled with a deep desire to be a wife and a mother . . . we've seen that her emotional state is spectacularly fragile, we've seen her self-doubt, we've seen her describe how depressing winters are in England (already in 1956), etc. etc. Some passages are tough to read:My whole being, in its recusing and refusing after my 3-years struggle to build it flexible and strong again, my whole being has grown and interwound so completely with Ted's that if anything were to happen to him, I do not see how I could live. I would either go mad, or kill myself. I cannot conceive of life without him.It's especially tragic as the reader has gotten to know her so well, and has watched her grow up, in a way; I kept thinking of my own young daughters, having this sense of wanting to help her, but of course it's far too late. Anyway maybe this sounds dark or difficult, and possibly I was biased because I happen to have already been a fan of Plath, but I highly recommend the Journals to anyone with even a passing interest in her work.
3550753448	Last night, driving back from Boston, I lay back in the car and let the coloured lights come at me, the music from the radio, the reflection of the guy driving. It all flowed over me with a screaming ache of pain… remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I’ve taken for granted. When you feel that this may be good-bye, the last time, it hits you harder. When I was fifteen and read The Bell Jar I did not expect to feel so understood by a woman in her early twenties receiving shock treatment in the ‘50s. Being a woman in Sylvia Plath’s decade differs greatly from the female experience today. Of course, the “female experience” is an extremely general term, and purposefully so, but I would like to note that I do acknowledge that other factors take place when describing a woman’s experience in Western civilization and in the 21st century. Either way, despite the differences between womanhood now and in the ‘50s, reading Plath’s descriptions of finding her place in a patriarchal world, and her relationship to femininity and masculinity has resonated with me so completely, and impressively so. As are her reflections about coming of age, about depression, about being a writer, about feeling useless and talentless, about feeling time slip between your fingers, about the vehement desire to be everything or nothing, about the torment of being subjected to a world built on the expectancy to conform and limit and convert any original soul into another model, identical to the rest, about the desperate, nagging, heart-squeezing desire to be someone to create life and to be wholly authentic and original and… perfect.Reading Sylvia Plath’s journals has been a life-changing experience to me. I started this book in February, and to look back on who I was when I began this book, and who I am now, has been interesting and inspiring. When I began Plath’s journals, I was taken aback by how lush her prose were, even though they were written solely for herself. In her room, her dorm, in Paris, Cape Cod, she breathes and exhales poetry and beauty and rawness in ways that enamoured and inspired me far more than her poetry or fiction have. And that is not a jab at her poetry or fiction at all, for I hold both so dearly to my heart and soul, it is rather an enormous praise to the nooks of her mind, and the creative, artistic, and existential treasures that could be found in there – unedited, stream-of-consciousness. These journals are pages and pages and pages of sweat, blood, and tears converted to ink, to poetry, to art. Her journals inspired me, back in February, to begin treating every time I write like I am creating. I started treating my journal entries as though I was writing a poem or a story, and it enhanced both my experience writing and even living. Sylvia Plath’s personality was not depressive. She had depression, but she wasn’t the somber pessimist the media makes her out to be. She was wise and eager for life, and despite her (chosen) demise, much of her writing, even when horribly depressed (but not always), is about how beautiful, how full, how insightful and enlightening life and living are. She writes about the thrill of the world, of people, and of experiences, dark and light. Reading about her life and how she wrote paragraphs about the little things – how the wind feels and the world looks when riding a bike, about walking the streets at night, about the children playing in the sand on the beach. Everything was an opportunity for romanticism to Sylvia, everything was an inspiration. To take a peek into the mind of someone like that has been, for me, beautiful and galvanising. I look at the world differently because of her; I find meaning and poetry in more than I used to. She flipped a switch in my brain which illuminated a bulb I tried many times to light, and much of my personal and creative growth this year, I owe to her. There is a certain unique and strange delight about walking down an empty street alone. There is an off-focus light cast by the moon, and the streetlights are part of the spotlight apparatus on a bare stage set up for you to walk through. You get a feeling of being listened to , so you talk aloud, softly, to see how it sounds.I took many breaks when reading this book, and each time I would return, I would find that Sylvia was exploring themes or struggling with issues that were relevant to my current line of thought, or my current state. This continuously baffled me, how I connected to what she wrote about. I feel rather guilty to say that I relate to Sylvia Plath, as I never knew her, but I will say that I relate greatly to how I have interpreted her writing and her experiences and struggles, and how she has articulated her life. I have never felt that way reading anyone else’s writing, and the more I know about Sylvia Plath, the more I want to know and understand about her – and also myself. Sylvia Plath, to many people that read her work and are inspired by her creatively, has indeed reached the stars. She has kissed divinity. She has achieved what she worked so hard for her entire life, and what she dreamed of with such rigour, with such passion and force. Plath was bursting with beauty and rage and misery and energy and life. Her mind was alive; arguably, far more than most people’s. I often consider what she would think about her literature being taught at universities, and her journals being published and fervidly annotated by a certain girl. I’m honestly not sure what she would think. I hope at the very least, she would think: “I did make it.” “That moment of illumination, fusion, creation: We made this: against the whole falling apart, away, and the coming again to make and make in the face of the flux: making of the moment something of permanence. That is the life-work. I underlined and underlined: reread that. I shall go better than she… My health is making stories, poems, novels, of experience: that is why, or, rather, that is why it is good, that I have suffered and been to hell, although not to all the hells. I cannot life for life itself: but for the words which stay the flux. My life, I feel, will not be lived until there are books and stories which relive it perpetually in time… Writing breaks open the vaults of the dead and the skies behind which the prophesying angles hide. The mind makes and makes, spinning its web.” “Last night, blunted as I was by agony, revolted at food and the distant bumbling noise of talk and laughter, I ran out the dining room and walked alone back to the house. What world blue could get that dazzling drench of blue moonlight on the flat, luminous field of white snow, with the black trees against the sky, each with its particular configuration of branches? I felt shut in, imprisoned, aware that it was fine and shudderingly beautiful, but too gone with pain and aching to respond and become apart of it.”

6843888173	Leer Los diarios de Sylvia Plath es sumergirse en una introspección profunda que, de manera inevitable, nos hace vernos reflejados en sus palabras. Plath escribió con una honestidad desgarradora, y uno de los fragmentos más impactantes dice: «Sí, estaba loca por ti y lo sigo estando […] corté porque no podía soportar ser un capricho, porque antes de entregar mi cuerpo debo entregar mis pensamientos, mi espíritu, mis sueños, y a ti no te interesaba nada de todo eso.» Este pasaje revela la esencia de su vida y su obra, en donde la dualidad entre el deseo de ser amada y su anhelo de autenticidad se entrelazan dolorosamente.Este diario nos ofrece una visión profunda de quién fue Sylvia Plath, de los amores y sombras que definieron su vida y su escritura. La primera mitad del libro es la más cruda y emocional, especialmente considerando que estamos leyendo los pensamientos íntimos de alguien que, con sus palabras, se desnuda ante el lector. Es imposible no sentir la transformación que ella experimenta bajo la sombra de Ted Hughes; su admiración hacia él se convierte en una cadena que la coloca en un segundo plano, haciendo que se cuestione sus propias convicciones y hasta su voz feminista. Es frustrante y, a la vez, conmovedor ver cómo Sylvia se desdibuja por amor, cómo se silencia y se somete, perdiendo parte de su esencia.Muchos lectores critican la segunda mitad del diario, pero a mí me parece fascinante. Aquí vemos a una Sylvia más cotidiana, humana, con días grises y momentos luminosos que destacan en medio de sus propias sombras. Estos pasajes, aunque menos intensos, muestran la complejidad de una vida que no era solo tragedia, sino también rutina, dudas y pequeños instantes de paz.Si bien el libro puede sentirse extenso y en momentos agotador, cada página aporta una pieza clave para entender la mente de Sylvia Plath. Es una lectura esencial para quien busque conocer no solo a la poeta, sino también a la mujer, con todas sus contradicciones y su lucha por ser ella misma en un mundo que parecía destinado a aplastarla.
3061916035	Nie wiem, czego się spodziewałam, kiedy zaczynałam czytać. Długich wywodów o depresji i małżeństwie? Cóż, są, ale inne niż sądziłam. Przy najcięższej depresji Plath nie kontynuuje dziennika, co doskonale rozumiem. Czego się spodziewałam? Że będzie taka młoda. Dziennik zaczyna się w momencie, gdy Plath rozpoczyna naukę na uniwersytecie, ma osiemnaście lat i pomimo pierwszych publikacji w magazynach dla dziewcząt, jest niesamowicie naiwna. Na początku skupia się przede wszystkim randkach, relacjach romantycznych, wyglądzie. Jej podejście do nauki jest czysto użytkowe. I wciąż jest przy tym ambitną poetką, którą załamują niepowodzenia, którą bolą sukcesy rówieśników. Dziwne refleksje, jakie nachodziły mnie w trakcie lektury: gdyby Plath wiedziała, czym jest masturbacja, nie marnowałaby tyle czasu na randki. Widać, że chodzi na nie z obowiązku. Nie ma pozytywnego stosunku do obowiązującego modelu heteroseksualności, widzi go tym, czym jest: jawną niesprawiedliwością, gdzie kobiety tylko tracą, przede wszystkim siebie, nie ma złudzeń, że instytucja małżeństwa to nic innego jak zalegalizowana prostytucja. W końcu to lata 50. Ale nie próbuje wypisać się z tego modelu, męczy się, ale go nie odrzuca. Plath jest bardzo mieszczańska i to jej problem.Elementy homofobii i antysemityzmu. Dużo pisze o swojej twórczości, o zmaganiach i niepowodzeniach, poszukiwaniu fabuły na powieść, walce z sentymentalizmem przypisywanym kobiecej twórczości. Nie ma tu jasnego programu poetyckiego, nie padają żadne deklaracje, ale jest za to doskonale nakreślone to, co Brodkey nazywa sceną pisania - czysty warsztat twórczy, warunki pracy literackiej, wiwisekcja całego procesu. To mnie trzymało przy lekturze. Dziennik nie sprawił, że lepiej rozumiem poezję Plath. Nie ukrywam, że chwyciłam go z czysto voyerystycznych pobudek, chcąc podglądać czyjeś życie. Pod tym względem nie zawiódł. Perwersyjna przyjemność po całości. Kiedy Plath umarła, była młodsza niż ja jestem teraz. To sprawia, że z większym entuzjazmem podchodzę do brania antydepresantów.

2343074364	Demorei meses pra ler esse diário. Comecei, se não me engano, em abril. Foi um mergulho profundo na vida da Sylvia, que sempre admirei como poetisa e como escritora de um dos meus romances favoritos, A redoma de vidro. Eu fiquei impressionada que, assim como em A redoma, as questões que a Sylvia aborda em seu diários são super... contemporâneas! Questões das mulheres, de complexo de inferioridade, da insegura que nos é imposta. Infelizmente o final da trajetória dela é triste, mas o legado que ela deixou é inesquecível. Assim como seus poemas, desenhos e contos. Eu amo essa mulher! E sinto muito por tudo que ela passou
6458487323	۳.۵ کتاب خاطرات سیلویا پلات از جمله کتاب‌هایی بود که مصرانه دنبالش بودم که بخرم. این مربوط به سال ۴۰۰ می‌شه کتاب چاپ تموم بود. نهایتا هم هدیه گرفتمش و از وقتی به دستم رسید شروع کردم به خوندنش. حدود ۱۰۰ صفحه رو پیوسته خوندم اما بعد بنا به اتفاقات اینقدر کتاب‌های دیگه‌ای شروع کردم که این کتاب به فراموشی سپرده شد. تا اینکه اخیرا دوباره سراغش رفتم.البته جز این اتفاق که دیگه کتاب تقریبا فرموش و کنار گذاشته شد، کمی هم از انتظاراتم بدتر بود. البته من نه کتاب حباب شیشه‌ای رو خوندم و نه شعرهای پلات رو. به خاطر همین شاید جاذبه‌ی یادداشت‌های پلات درباره‌ی درگیری‌های ذهنی و تلاش‌هاش برای خلق اثارش چندان کششی برام نداشت و یا حتی ارجاعاتش برای شعرها و طرح اولیه رمان‌هاش برام نامفهوم بود. اما فارغ از این، به زعم من اگه یادداشت‌ها یکم فیلتر می‌شدن و همه‌ش توی کتاب گذاشته نمی‌شد شاید بهتر بود. البته شاید همین که یادداشت‌های روزانه‌ش رو جزء به جزء بخونیم فهم بهتری از وضعیت ذهنی پلات به دست آورده بشه. البته تد هیوز، همسر پلات، توی مقدمه ذکر می‌کنه که یادداشت‌های آخر پلات رو نابوده کرده چون می‌خواسته فراموش کنه. اما به نظر من احتمالا همون یادداشت‌های حذف و نابود شده، جاذبه‌ی بیشتری داشتن. هرچند ناامید و دلسرد کننده بوده باشن. هرچند که این‌ها حدسیات منه صرفا. البته کلا هم به اینکه یادداشت‌های پلات در دست تد هیوز بوده و اون نهایتا بنا به صلاح‌دید خودش این‌ها رو چاپ کرده بدبینم.نهایتا وقتی دوباره بعد ۲ ۳ سال وقفه سراغ این کتاب رفتم جالب بود و خوندن ۲۰۰ ۳۰۰ صفحه‌ی آخر بسیار خوشایند. زندگی پلات و مخصوصا رابطه‌ش با تد هیوز کنجکاوی برانگیزه. بخش‌هایی از کتاب هم که خشم و عشق پلات نسبت به تد هیوز رو می‌دیدم برام جالب‌تر می‌شد. اینکه دقیقا هیوز برای پلات به چه شکل بوده. گویی گاهی ناجی و گاهی شکنجه‌گر. اما حیف که ادم نمی‌تونه واقعیت خالص رو بدونه؛ اگه چنین واقعیتی وجود داشته باشه.خوندن یادداشت‌های روزانه‌ی پلات و تشویش‌های ذهنی و گاه آرامش و احساس رضایت که واضحا کمتر از تشویشاتش بود، به خوبی توی کلماتش بیان می‌شه. مخصوصا قسمت‌هایی از کتاب که سیلویا پلات با تراپیستش حرف می‌زنه هم واقعا راه‌گشا بود برای رسیدن به کنه ذهنش. یادداشت‌های کتاب مخصوصا در بوستون و در سال‌های ۱۹۵۸ تا ۱۹۵۹ برام محسوس‌تر بود. انگار که نویسندگی پلات در یادداشت‌هاش هم به کمی پختگی می‌رسه. تو خط به خط کتاب سرخوردگی پلات، ارتباط مایوس کننده‌ای که با خودش و جهان برقرار می‌کنه قابل درک و ناراحت کننده ست. اینکه چه اتفاقاتی کم کم منجر به اون اتفاق تراژیک در سرگذشت پلات شد با خوندن این یادداشت‌ها میسر می‌شه. از کار کردن در تیمارستان گرفته تا زخمی شدن پرنده‌ای که برای مداوا به خونه‌شون آورده بودن.خیلی وقته که می‌خوام سراغ کتاب‌های پلات برم و باز هم انگار فرصتش پیش نمیاد و شاید برگشت به این کتاب این فرصت رو مهیا کنه که به زودی بخونم کاراش رو.
2693750918	Plath is undeniably talented but I was hoping to read something raw. Even in her diary she is putting on a show. Romanticizing even the smallest and most mundane events in order to make them thought provoking. I wanted to read the real her. There are many lines in here that are gems but are weeded around paragraphs of nothing. She seems really pretentious in these which is sad because I used to really like and relate to her.
4204595502	wow.- mam tyle myśli w głowie, że aż nie wiem, od czego w ogóle zacząć. Tak wiele zróżnicowanych emocji nie dostarczyła mi chyba jeszcze żadna inna książka. Żadnej też tak długo nie czytałam. W pewnym momencie musiałam aż zrobić sobie przerwę, która finalnie trwała kilka miesięcy. Może to czytanie tak przygnębiających myśli sprawiło, że potrzebowałam się oderwać, a może po prostu sama nie byłam w najlepszym stanie psychicznym na tak dołującą pozycję. Wróciłam więc do niej z trzeźwym umysłem i wreszcie udało mi się skończyć.Ciężko jednak tu cokolwiek ocenić, i nie będę tego robić, bo żaden epitet nie jest odpowiedni aby opisać nim życie drugiej osoby. Książka była niezwykle osobista; czasami można wręcz odczuć, że nawet trochę za bardzo wchodzimy w prywatne sfery życia autorki. Czuję irytację, wiedząc że Ted pozbył się "niewygodnych" dla niego stron dzienników, zwłaszcza tych pisanych w ostatnich chwilach życia Sylvii. Bardzo wzruszająca, przygnębiająca pozycja.

2514121946	Christ almighty, that Ted Hughes really deserved better than this wench. What a blabbermouth. She cried about every little thing, like people would wanna read about her PMSing all over the place! Hughes did the right thing by looking elsewhere to get his needs taken care of, Sensitive Sylvie here obviously wasn't up to the task. I tell you I'm following about 1000 different Instagram girls, Fullmetal Ifrit and Amy Jackson and all the rest, and they are the REAL inspirations. Believe me, nobody loves women more than I do. Me and a bunch of my buddies would get on those Jeff Epstein planes and respect women all across the beautiful skies of our nation. I know a real, respectable girl when I see one, and this plank was far fuckin' from. Real glad she booked a ticket out early so Ted could get those kids a real mother. How about the journals of that guy? These feminazis gettin on my last nerve. Smile for once, why dont ya?
3560892063	Recuerdo que Aprensiones fue el primer poema que leí de Sylvia y me impactó por el dolor tan descarnado que refleja. Así que inmediatamente me sentí atraída por su obra y su figura. La lectura de sus diarios me permitió adentrarme en sus pensamientos y comprobar su genialidad en todos los aspectos. Sus reflexiones sobre la vida, la muerte, la decadencia, la creación literaria, la maternidad y el lugar que ocupaba la mujer en la sociedad de su época son imperdibles. Recomiendo encarecidamente este libro, incluso aunque no se haya leído antes a Sylvia. La edición de Alba es preciosa, contiene algunas fotografías y dibujos, así como varias imágenes de partes manuscritas de los diarios. Una gran escritora que sufrió hasta que no pudo soportarlo más.

4707835585	Intense and fascinating read into the life of Sylvia Plath; A brilliant writer and a passionate, complex woman whose mind in eighteen years of age had such depth and keen insight. The Unabridged Journal itself unfortunately has missing parts of her significant, critical period in life that were destroyed by her husband. The journal is better to be read in small bites, as it can be a slog to get through at times, as journal naturally is.“I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.”“I have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad. Or I can go mad by ricocheting in between.”“I love people. Everybody. I love them, I think, as a stamp collector loves his collection. Every story, every incident, every bit of conversation is raw material for me. My love's not impersonal yet not wholly subjective either. I would like to be everyone, a cripple, a dying man, a whore, and then come back to write about my thoughts, my emotions, as that person. But I am not omniscient. I have to live my life, and it is the only one I'll ever have. And you cannot regard your own life with objective curiosity all the time...”“I want to taste and glory in each day, and never be afraid to experience pain; and never shut myself up in a numb core of nonfeeling, or stop questioning and criticizing life and take the easy way out. To learn and think: to think and live; to live and learn: this always, with new insight, new understanding, and new love.”“And the danger is that in this move toward new horizons and far directions, that I may lose what I have now, and not find anything except loneliness.”“I do not love; I do not love anybody except myself. That is a rather shocking thing to admit. I have none of the selfless love of my mother. I have none of the plodding, practical love. . . . . I am, to be blunt and concise, in love only with myself, my puny being with its small inadequate breasts and meager, thin talents. I am capable of affection for those who reflect my own world.”“Being born a woman is my awful tragedy. From the moment I was conceived I was doomed to sprout breasts and ovaries rather than penis and scrotum; to have my whole circle of action, thought and feeling rigidly circumscribed by my inescapable feminity. Yes, my consuming desire to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, bar room regulars--to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording--all is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yet, God, I want to talk to everybody I can as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...”“With me, the present is forever, and forever is always shifting, flowing, melting. This second is life. And when it is gone it is dead. But you can't start over with each new second. You have to judge by what is dead. It's like quicksand... hopeless from the start. ”

4503028834	Los diarios de Sylvia Plath son un retrato crudo y desgarrador del camino tortuoso que lleva a una mente brillante a la locura.En estas páginas encontramos la lucha de Sylvia, atrapada entre su genio y angustia por conciliar su talento literario con sus roles de esposa y madre, así como su lucha contra la depresión y la inseguridad. A medida que recorremos estos diarios íntimos, nos topamos con momentos de introspección profunda y descripciones vívidas del mundo que la rodeaba, junto con una necesidad constante por encontrar un lugar en un mundo que a menudo parecía no entenderla. Plath escribía con una honestidad brutal, sin filtros ni autocompasión, dejando al descubierto la vulnerabilidad y el dolor que subyacían en su vida cotidiana. Sus diarios son una lectura difícil y conmovedora, pero también una celebración del poder de la palabra y el talento innegable de una escritora que, a pesar de su breve vida, dejó un legado indeleble en la literatura.

3315014848	Me gusta mucho cómo Sylvia lleva sus diarios: es sumamente descriptiva, juega con los formatos y se pasea por sus emociones con una racionalidad envidiable. Más que entender su obra, este compilado sirve para entender la relación con su madre y con sus amores. Spoiler: Te odio, Ted Hughes.

5050214942	I was in awe, across all 700 pages or so. What a life, and what a beautiful, powerful writer with a dogged spirit despite rejection (“Woolf works off her depression over rejections from Harper’s! (No less—- and I can hardly believe that the Big One’s get rejected, too!”). Her diaries have been marching steadfastly alongside me the past few months. Such an honor that we are able to read the inner workings of Plath, though one does question the morality of Hughes’ publishing her diaries posthumously. It was hard to read of her depression throughout her life, especially in contrast to those sweet moments of her adoration and belief in the beauty of life: “‘I am part of all that I have met.’ To you, all, whether or not you know, having wandered into the tissue of my life, and out again, you have left a momentary part of you which I will work into something. There is nothing but that it will suffer a sea change into something rich and strange. Through me transmuted. Oh I bite, I bite on life like a sharp apple. Playing it like a fish, I am happy. And what is happy? It is a going always on. There is something better to be done than I have done, and spurred by the fair delusion of progress, I will seek to progress, to whip myself on, to more and more - to learnings. Always. I have a well, deep, clear, and tartly sweet, of living. All the names, already, and the places. And I am nowhere near the ending.”Her authenticity, her somewhat painful vulnerability, made one feel not alone in the patterns and questions of life: love, challenges of making it in the world as an artist (“…this enervating fatigue like a secret and destructive fever - can I do my dreams justice?”), rejection, moving countries, children and motherhood, (also strangely similar Boston-UK-NYC pipeline to relate to)... Apologies for the long winding review, but I felt I needed to give it justice (plus give justice to the 2 month long reading experience of constantly being seen carrying around this big heavy book and explaining to people that I’m reading Sylvia Plath’s journals but “I really am fine!”). What an epic, in the most human way. “Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little?“ - Yes!
4302780376	After long, long ten months, I have finished reading this haunting collection of Sylvia plath’s journals leading from her teenage years, up until months before her overwhelmingly tragic death. I went into this knowing I wish to take my time with it, read it slowly and let the words sink into my mind & heart, but I truly would’ve never guessed it would mean I would finish it in almost a year’s time. That is absurd! And yet so so needed, looking back I think it was the best decision I ever made with indulging in a book as heavy as this.I went through so much in this time, had a lot of similar stories and experiences as Sylvia. Especially during the first half of it and I truly It felt as if I got to know her (i became very parasocial I must admit), or that I morphed into a version of her..I think she is one of the most brilliant, intelligent writers I have ever had the pleasure of reading, and I recommend to everyone to put away their thoughts on her and tune in to this rollercoaster of emotions of agony, but beautiful, surreal and poetic symphony of words.
4392889089	Reading someone's journal is always the most intimate experience of the said person. You penetrate right into the very core of their soul, explore every crevice of their mind. What they put onto the pages are the most private confessions that are supposed to remain hidden from the world, and thus, you see the person it their truest essence, without filter and pretence. Reading Plath's journals was the most intimate way to look inside her brilliant mind, and it revealed more than reading any of her works could — this was the real her, unfiltered, raw, sometimes soaring and elated, other times despairing and broken. Her journals show a real human being, complex in her nature, sometimes easy to understand and relate to, sometimes making choices or having beliefs that make one pause for a while and stare at the pages in disbelief. They are also the most prevalent literary proof of her brilliance and incredible talent, leaving you thinking of all the possible classics Plath could have bestowed upon us were it not for her tragic death at such a young age.The first half of the book reads wonderfully. You see a bright young woman full of energy and ambition, contemplating all that is happening around her, brimming with life and potential, ready to be seen and heard in the world. The entries were full of introspection but also observation, showing a young but mature mind questioning the status quo and trying to make sense out of her life. The massive shift in her writing begins to be notable after the year 1956, the year she married Ted Hughes. Suddenly, you see a woman in despair, somewhat isolated, doubting her brilliance, and always putting herself in an inferior position to praise Hughes. At times, the pattern of domestic abuse could not be more explicit; at other times, you must read between the lines but notice the hints nonetheless. It would be a lie if I said that her subservience was not concerning at certain points.Reading Plath's journals is like having an older sister by your side. She guides you, inspires you, and encourages you, but at the same time infuriates you, cautions you, and bares her mistakes in front of you so that you do not repeat them yourself.

5524161543	La obra de Silvia Plath siempre se ha caracterizado por una base biografica, vida y obra van de la mano y en este libro podemos adentrarnos en la vida de la autora desde su perspectiva de forma intimista. Silvia era muy introspectiva, inteligente y con mucha convicción en referente a sus metas y sueños de dedicarse a la escritura. En muchos sentidos, ella alcanzó tanto en su corta vida, pero su propia percepción de sí misma siempre se veía menguada por su depresión. También hay guiños a sus ideas, de escritura tanto en poemas como sus primeras ideas para la campana de cristal. Y pese a su gran conflicto emocional, ella lograba tener introspección sobre su enfermedad mental y el origen del mismo. Sí te gusta la autora y su escritura, es un libro con mucho valor que complementa la obra de la autora. A mí me encantó.
2453236014	the first chunk of the book was really introspective and insightful but since her marriage to Ted I guess or after her return to the US to be exact, she becomes awfully annoying, she keeps planning and planning but never really does anything, she writes about ideas for stories and ways to improve herself but she actually does nothing and is stuck in a loop of inspiration which sucks and annoys me as well. so i quit it because i thought i could do something more useful with my time other than forcing myself to finish it, maybe if you want to know more about her life you should read the abridged version. because i just couldn't continue.

2192674148	Hablar de estos diarios es un tanto complicado. Ya que en ellos hay muchos años de intimidad, sentimientos, reflexiones... Todo ello en una atmósfera cargada de crudeza. Sinceramente, ha sido una gran experiencia dejarme llevar de la mano de Sylvia. “¿Qué decisión interior, qué asesinato o qué fuga de cárcel debo cometer interiormente si quiero hablar desde mi profunda y verdadera voz cuando escribo?”
16980352	The depth of this woman never ceases to amaze me. I spent three months meticulously combing through her journal entries for a paper I was working on in graduate school. Though I've always been a huge fan of Plath (me and every other woman under thirty), I probably never would have picked up this book if it weren't for this paper. I'm very grateful that I did.
4045322037	Прослухала насправді десь половину. Початок був чарівний, дівочі переживання - справжні і вічні. Далі потрібно було б перейти на "текст очима", слухати стало досить нудно. І зараз важко повернутися до книги. Для мене Сільвія Плат абсолютно геніальна, Amy Winehouse від літератури, вся зібрана з занадто сильних почуттів - життя не витримує такого понад тридцять років.

I can never train myself in all the skills I want. and why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. and I am horribly limited.〞〝and by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. the worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.〞〝I desire the things that will destroy me in the end.〞〝god, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of "parties" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. and when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship - but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible and overpowering.〞〝I like people too much or not at all. I've got to go down deep, to fall into people, to really know them.〞〝I am still so naïve; I know pretty much what I like and dislike; but please, don’t ask me who I am. a passionate, fragmentary girl, maybe?〞〝I don’t care about anyone, and the feeling is quite obviously mutual.〞〝I wonder why I don't go to bed and go to sleep. but then it would be tomorrow, so I decide that no matter how tired, no matter how incoherent I am, I can skip on hour more of sleep and live.〞ig: @winterrainreads
4100524583	Sylvia Plath , one of the most influential writers of the 20th century , from teaching in Smiths college ( 1957-1958)To her controversial marriage with Hughes leading to her suicide at the age of 30 in the winter of February 1963; which paved the way not only to the rise of her success, but allowing many critics to label her as “ desperate “ “ too emotional “ perhaps “ too sentimental” .One certainly cannot deny that Plath is adored due to her tragedy causing her to archive many awards just years after her calamitous suicide .The Unabridged journals are a raw and emotional invitation to get to know the poet in a better sense ,to understand her pain , her emotions and the many reasons for her numerous suicide attempts .from facing her family demons to having an insatiable hatred against her mother due to the murder of his father .Throughout the second half of the journals (1956-1961)The poet seemed to compare herself nonstop making herself little towards her husband being highly overshadowed by him .Would have Sylvia published her own diaries if she had survived? That is surely a question that will remain unanswered .
1200309168	I admit: I couldn't finish the last 1/3 of the journals because I don't care what Sylvia Plath did every second of her days. She keeps going on and on about what she has done that day and I don't think anybody needs to read that. A short collection from her journals focusing on her ideas would suffice. There were some nice parts that I could relate to but, seriously, I don't need to read that she had coffee with Ted that day. Also, this collection literally destroyed my respect for Sylvia Plath because her most important problem seemed like "finding a husband" to me. I regret having read these.
