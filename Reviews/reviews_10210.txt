2018976953	“‘Jane, be still; don't struggle so like a wild, frantic bird, that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.’ ‘I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you.’” I am glad that in 1847 Charlotte Bronte made the decision to publish her novel under a male pseudonym. Currer Bell had a much better chance of being published than Charlotte Bronte and, with reviewers and readers assuming that she was in fact a male writer, allowed the novel a chance to be weighed properly without prejudice. Jane Eyre became a bestseller. The question is, of course, would the novel have been so successful or even published at all if CHARLOTTE BRONTE had been emblazoned on the cover? I like to think that some editor would have realized the bloody brilliance of the story and would have published it anyway, even if they didn’t spend any money on promoting it. Would readers have bought it? Hopefully, word would have trickled out about how compelling the plot was, and people would have overcome their natural prejudice for reading a novel by a woman. So isn’t it fun that Charlotte tricked everyone, including her own father? She did not confess her efforts to him until she had become successful. Even writing these words, I have a smile on my face thinking of this successful bamboozlement of publishers, editors, and readers. The story, of course, is larger than the book. Most people with any kind of inquisitive nature have been exposed to the bare bones of this novel without ever reading the book. Maybe they watched a movie based on the book, or maybe they have heard it referenced. Once read, it is impossible for people not to use aspects of this novel as common reference points for other readers. Take Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester himself, the master of Thornfield Hall. He is a brooding, complicated, dark, and intelligent creature. He is a force of nature who conforms the world around him with every stride he takes or every word that drops from his lips. He is the embodiment of the Lord Byron character. It doesn’t matter that he is not handsome. He is powerful. Women swoon in his presence and, after a carefully administered smelling salt, might start calculating what he is worth a year. Rochester is completely taken by Jane Eyre, practically from the moment they meet. The drama of their meeting is one of those great cinematic scenes in the history of literature. Bronte incorporates many scenes into the novel that are, frankly, gifts to future movie renditions. Rochester has never met anyone quite like her. He is not alone. Everyone who comes into contact with Jane Eyre knows they have met a unique person. She is a kind and pleasant person, but she will not brook any discriminations against her character. Mrs. Reed (her aunt), Mr. Brocklehurst (director of Lowood School attended by Jane), Mr. St John Eyre Rivers (minister who asks to marry her), and even Mr. Rochester, all attempt to conform Jane to the acceptable, deferring Victorian woman of the time. To call this a feminist novel does put it in a box which constrains it too tightly. Jane or Charlotte, either one, would loosen those bindings and let it breath as Charlotte’s intentions with this novel go well beyond the confines of any specific genre. I found her ideas of female equality, embodied so wonderfully in the character of Jane, inspiring. ”Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their effort, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer, and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.” I hear you, Charlotte. Can you imagine the impact of such words on your typical, Victorian housewife? A woman who has lived her whole life being the daughter of her father, the wife of her husband, the mother of her sons. She has been passed from the care of one man after another. If she were fortunate enough to be born pretty, she has that brief moment of power when suiters contend for her hand, but probably, ultimately, her father would decide who was best for her to marry. How about the impact of reading this novel on the typical, Victorian man? Did he look up from this book and peer over at his wife, she looking rosy in the firelight, knitting away at some frivolous thing, and think...does she want more? Or maybe he sees his pretty daughter enter the room on the verge of womanhood, and does he consider the possibility that she wants or deserves more? There is no spark of revolution inspired by this book, but I do hope that this book may have chipped away at some of the archaic ideas of inequality. Maybe a few women readers realized that some of those secret desires they have harbored their whole life were not such strange concepts. When Jane stands up to the conformists she encounters, she is willing to take the punishment because she knows in her soul that what she believes about herself is incontestable. This is no better illustrated than in her interactions with (I’m sorry to say this because it isn’t completely fair) the odious St. John Eyre Rivers. He wants to marry her but only for the sake that he believes she will make a wonderful, useful, missionary wife. He doesn’t love her. She is willing to go, but only as a “sister,” not as a wife. Jane refuses to compromise, but there is this moment where she is teetering in the balance. I’m mentally screaming to her at this point. ”I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on my limbs.” He is a cold man who would have gladly marched OUR Jane off to some godforsaken part of the world to die some horrible death from disease or from simple neglect. I know the plot; and yet, I’m still completely invested in every scene. There is always the possibility that I’ve fallen into an alternative universe and I am reading some other version of Jane Eyre with a completely different ending. I can assure everyone this did not happen. When Jane is residing with Mrs. Read, she describes her place to sleep as a “small closet.” I can’t help but think of the closet under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive. Like Harry Potter, she is also an orphan but still with a rebellious streak because she is also sure that she is supposed to be someone other than who she is currently perceived to be. The relief she experiences when she learns she is getting away from the condescending attitude of the Read house and going away to school at Lowood also reminds me of Harry’s relief to discover he, too, is escaping to Hogwarts. Though I must say Harry, despite the trials and tribulations he experiences, draws a better straw than Miss Jane. I really enjoyed the gothic elements; those were, to a degree, completely unexpected. ”’Oh sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a discoloured face--it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!’ ‘Ghost are usually pale, Jane.’ ‘This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?’ ‘You may.’ ‘Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre.’” There are noises in the night at Thornfield Hall. There is an unknown tenant locked away in the rafters of the house. There are secrets. There are unexpected fires. There are scandals waiting to be known. In fact, the twists of the plot were considered so outrageous for the time that the book acquired a reputation for being “improper.” This helped to boost sales further. The Bronte family was very close. They grew up conceiving their own stories and fantasies and acting them out in impromptu plays. All three girls and the brother, Branwell, were writers. Tragically, they all died young. Charlotte outlived them all, dying in 1855 at the age of 38 with her unborn child. Branwell (31) and Emily (30) both passed away in 1848, and Anne died the following year at the age of 29. Can you imagine having to bury all your siblings? It must have felt like the spectre of death was stalking the Brontes. What makes Rochester unique is that he does eventually see Jane the way she sees herself. ”Fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his eyes.” I will remember that line ”desire of his eyes” for a long time. She is a hidden gem in rooms full of people. Charlotte Bronte makes some good points through Jane’s eyes at how unaware wealthy people are of the true natures of those who serve them. I would talk about the love story, but what is there to say. It is one for the ages. I would say that Charlotte Bronte never found her Rochester in real life, but some letters have come to light, written to a man named Constantin Héger, that suggests that maybe she did. He was married to someone else, and when Elizabeth Gaskell wrote the biography of her friend, she carefully edited out those very revealing letters of a love that could never be. Jane Eyre, may you always find the readers you deserve.

866121509	Reader, I gave it five stars. Please let me tell you why. Jane Eyre is the quintessential Victorian novel. It literally has everything that was typical of the period, but, unlike other novels, it has all the elements in one story. At the centre is the romance between Jane and Rochester, which is enhanced by gothic elements such as the uncanniness of the doppleganger and the spectre like qualities of Bertha. In addition, it is also a governess novel; these were an incredibly popular type of storytelling in the age and for it to be combined with gothic elements, which are interposed with a dualistic relationship between realism and romance, is really quite unique. The correct term for this is a hybrid, in which no genre voice is dominant; they exist alongside each other creating one rather special book. And this is so, so, special; it’s an excellent piece of literature. Jane’s journey is gut wrenching and emotional. Through her life she experiences real sorrow, the kind that would make a lesser person give up. She also experiences real friendship, the type that comes across perhaps once in a lifetime. But, most significantly, she experiences true love and the development of independence to form he own ending. I really do love this book. Bronte utilises the first person narrative, which creates a high degree of intimacy with her character; it makes me feel like I know Jane as well as she comes to know her own self. “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.” Jane’s a strong willed individual. From a very young age she had the clarity of intelligence to recognise the injustice that was her life; yes, she is narrating her story retrospectively, though she still had the perceptiveness to realise how mistreated she was. I love the pathetic fallacy Bronte uses at the beginning. The child Jane looks out the window, shielded by the curtain, and witnesses the horrible weather. It is cold and bleak; it is windy and morose; thus, we can immediately see the internal workings of Jane’s mind. The weather reflects her feelings throughout the novel, and at the very beginning the situation was at its worse. This can also be seen with the fire imagery that represents her rage when she is shoved in the red room; it later mirrors that of Bertha’s fury. Everybody needs love, children especially so. These early experiences help to define her later character, and, ultimately influence how she sees the world; she still hides behind a curtain in Rochester’s house when he flirts with Miss Ingrum. These experiences set her on an almost perpetual quest for love, for belonging and for the independence to make her own decisions. She finds friendship in the form of Helen Burns; she gives her some sound advice, but Jane cannot fully accept such religious fatalism. However, it does inspire her, a little, to continue with life; she realises, no matter what happens, she will always have the love of her greatest friend. Jane clings to this idea, but, ultimately, has to seek a more permanent solution to her loneliness. She needs a vocation, one that will fulfil her and give her life meaning; thus, she becomes a governess and crosses paths with the downtrodden, miserable wretch that is Mr Rochester. Sometimes I feel like Rochester didn’t know quite what he wanted. When he sees Jane he sees a woman with strength, blunt honesty and integrity: he sees an emotional equal. This attracts her to him, which develops into love. However, when he tries to express his love he does it through trying to claim her as his own. Through doing so, not only does he show the nature of Victorian marriage, he shows his own deep vulnerability. He loves her mind, her intelligence, and he too wants to be loved. He longs for it with a frightening passion. So, instead of doing things the way Jane would have wanted him to do, he overwhelms her with expensive affection. By doing so he almost loses her. All Jane wanted was his heart, nothing more nothing less. By showering her with such flattery and expensive items, he insults her independence. He risks destroying the thing that attracted him to her in the first place, their equality; their mutual respect and love. He takes away her dignity. I really don’t think the original marriage would have worked. Ignore the existence of the mad woman in the attic; I just think Rochester would have spoilt it. It would have become too awkward. They needed to be on the same societal level as well as one of intellect and character. The ending is touching and a little sad, but it is the only one that could ever have worked for these two characters. Without the tragedy there could never have be rejuvenation and the chance for them to be together on equal terms, no matter what it cost to get there. If that wasn’t enough reason for me to love this book, there are also elements of fantasy and desire. This is a realism novel, it pertains to credible events, but the suggestions of fantasy only add to the strong romantic notions. Rochester is enamoured by Jane; he cannot believe that a woman like her actually exists. All his misguided notions are brushed away in an instant. Whilst he views Jane as special, it is clear that he realises that other women may also have a similar rebellious voice, only hidden. He considers her an elf, a witch, an improbable woman that has captured his desire, his heart, his soul, his life. He knows he will never be the same again. From Jane’s point of view, her first encounter with him is otherworldly. She had grown bored with her governess role, and when she sees the approach of Rochester and his dog Pilot, she sees the gytrash myth; she wants to see something fantastical instead she finds her heart, which is something much rarer. Then there are also the feminist elements. Jane transgresses the boundary associated with her gender in the Victorian age. For a woman to be recognised as having equal intellect to that of a man was sadly a rare thing. Women could actually attend university, but the downside was they could never get the full degree. They could spend months studying, though never be recognised as actually having gained the qualification. It was just another attempt to keep women under the thumb, so for Bronte to portray the truth of Jane’s equal intellect is a great step for the recognition of women, and women writers. This book received a whole host of negative reviews at the time of its publication for this element alone. Stupid really, but that’s misogyny for you. Reader, I love this book. I really could go on, but this is getting kind of long. I hope I’ve made it clear why I love this story so much. I shall be reading this again later this year to correspond with my exams, which I’m already looking forward to- the reading that is, not the exams. I don’t think will ever have read this story enough though.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________
1268209461	I am a very pretentious person.I try to seem “hip” and “cool” and “relatable” and “down with the teens” - and of course I totally am all of those things - but also I have my tendencies toward pretension. It’s who I am. Just last night I shuddered at the idea of popular music, like some kind of eight-hundred-year-old gremlin.I am not proud of this side of me, but it’s who I am. And also it is important background information for you, dear Reader, going into this review. (That direct address to you as an audience member was me emulating this book, not an example of my pretension. Or was it???)Anyway. It’s important that you know my capacity to be pretentious so that I can make this statement:I don’t get how any reader can say they don’t like classics.Oof. A doozy, right? Aren’t you glad I warned you? Now you know that that wasn’t just a one-off of self-serious condescension but rather a pattern of my personality and oh sh*t actually my explanation probably made the whole thing a million times worse. Now I’ve painted my insufferability as consistent.Come back, everyone!!!! Let me explain!What I need to explain is that this book is excellent, and also a classic. It is very very old but sometimes old stuff is still worth it! (I should know. I have the mannerisms of the type of grumpy old man that gets endearingly profiled in Scandinavian bestsellers.)This is not the classic I would recommend that someone start with if they’re looking to get into the genre. It is very, very slow, and very wordy, and the language takes some settling in. But also this book is a literal gem.It was published in 19th century England, which is no one’s idea of Progressive Central. But this book is jarringly feminist when the constraints it (and Jane) were working in are taken into account. Jane is an independent woman, and this book from eighteen freakin’ forty-seven tells her story.Now, I love Jane Austen books as much as the next girl (if the next girl is pretty damn obsessed with Jane Austen), but that’s something not even all her books can say.Here’s the thing about this book: I love nineteenth century fiction (or what I’ve read of it), but even if you didn’t you’d probably love this book. So much of this is unique, by the standards of then but also even the standards of today. It’s a romance, yes, which: extremely normal. But it’s a romance between two characters who are not conventionally beautiful, which is unbelievably rare. It’s also not a romance that acts as basically the sole option for its female character. I love Pride & Prejudice, and I of course think Lizzie Bennet is a feminist (and awesome) character, but there’s no way for that book to end, really, that doesn’t include marriage for her. Three of the five Bennet sisters get married over the course of that book. It’s either that or old maid status, baby.But not lil Jane Eyre. She does not allow marriage to be the only prospect for her!! She goes away and makes a life for herself and then decides whether she wants to follow that path. We don’t even see that in every 21st century romance.Plus, Jane is an excellent character, and of a type we RARELY see. She’s serious and upstanding and smart and moral. She has a strong mind and she doesn’t shy away from that. She lacks the requisite features of today’s female subjects of romance: the quirkiness or the humor or the adorkable way she trips and falls/spills coffee/etc. She also lacks the nineteenth-century version of a lot of those traits. And it is so goddamn refreshing I can’t even tell you.And on top of all that, the language in this book is so gorgeous I want the whole manuscript tattooed on me.Which would be wild, because this is about a million pages long. And speaking of, yes, it is very slow and hard to get into and basically you have to adjust to a whole new reading experience. So I wouldn’t recommend starting off your nineteenth century fiction binge with this book.But I would recommend getting into nineteenth century fiction solely for the purpose of reading this book.Bottom line: IT’S JUST SO DAMN GOOD, YOU GUYS.-------------pre-reviewhey um...i love this book so stupid much???if you've got a free few hours over the course of the next few months i HIGHLY recommend rereading this book at a snail's pace. worked out for me very well.i should probably shout about my adoration of this book for several pages so. full review 2 come
2328420929	"Though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and--it would not do." "It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well."Oh Jane, you wondrously bold and beautiful gal. After she was orphaned, Jane Eyre was sent to live with her maternal uncle and his wife (Mrs. Reed). When her uncle dies, he forces his wife to swear to love, nurture and care for Jane as if she was their own child. Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Reed is not pleased in the least with this arrangement and does the absolute bare minimum towards Jane. She spoils her three biological children but sees Jane as a wicked, conniving and devilish child (despite ample evidence against). "I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling"Jane is sent off to boarding school where life is harsher than before (threadbare clothes, small rations) but she prefers it for she has finally found what she's been missing."There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort." At the end of her time there, she sets off to be a governess. She takes a job for a Mr. Rochester and tutors his young ward, Adel. Only, when she arrives at the house, she starts to notice certain things. The servants know something is up and won't tell her. Mr. Rochester is hiding a huge mystery and despite the danger, and the difference in social standing, Jane Eyre is falling ever faster in love.An absolutely stunning book. This is my third time through, and each time I am blown away by Jane's strength of character. With every twist life hurled at her, Jane merely straightened her shoulders, adjusted her pack and trudged on. Each time I read this novel, I notice something different. This time, it was how much Charlotte Bronte slipped her own beliefs into the novel:"Precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings...It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex."It made for a truly eye-opening rereadThe ABC Reading Challenge - J Audiobook CommentsRead by Nadia May. I may be the only one with this - but whenever I read a really old novel, I find it much easier to listen to (opposed to reading a copy). I spend less time puzzling out the language and unfamiliar terms and more time enjoying the story. I highly recommend listening to this book if you've tried reading it and just couldn't get into it.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
1434653576	The kind of novel that makes one believe in love (again) - or at least desire to hold on to the illusion. Likely my favourite read for 2020.For the time being, just basking and swooning. Inebriated.Speechless. I know it's out of fashionAnd a trifle uncoolBut I can't help itI'm a romantic fool(Illustration by Louisa Albani)"Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain and little, I am soulless and heartless?

1948481881	I feel like an ass saying this but... who actually thinks this is a cute romance!? What the actual f!!Now that this is out of the way. I did like Jane as a character and I also liked the portion of the book about her childhood but the two RoMaNcEs were train wrecks and if I hear anyone say they love M. Rochester I will forever judge you.Pride and Prejudice > Jane EyreThere I said it.

3095628760	My friend told me this book is kinky and she isn’t wrong. This was much weirder and darker than I thought it was going to be. All the edgy contemporary lit girlies wish they were doing it like her.
3291003356	mr. rochester walked so every other tall, dark, handsome, and broody male character could run. and thats the that on that.i really dont have much else to add that hasnt already been said about this book, considering its been around for 150+ years. but i will admit how impressed i am with how modern this story feels. i think thats a key factor in why i enjoyed this so much - because it doesnt feel like a classic to me. not only is the writing very accessible and incredibly easy to read, which i dont find to the case for most books written during this time period, but the dialogue between characters is very forward thinking. the conversations between jane and mr rochester are very much similar to conversations that are happening today. i really admire how bronte incorporates feminist ideals into this story. and i honestly didnt expect the low-key thriller vibes present in some parts, so that was fun. overall, this is a great story. 10/10 would recommend.↠ 4.5 stars
3630082382	Finally!!!!!Finally, we have a book written in the 1800's about a strong female main character. This book is incredibly moving and unpredictable.

500797391	I read this book back in High School. I hated it. I thought it was boring and stupid and all I wanted to do was spread the word that this book was terrible and no one should read it. I had it marked one star on Goodreads and it had a home on my least favorite shelf.Well, I have been waiting years to find the perfect place to use this gif:I reread in late August, early September 2017. I have to say that I should probably reread everything I read bank in High School to get a better perspective. I enjoyed the book quite a bit this time. The story in intricate and dark. Jane Eyre is a tragic hero who does her best through the whole book but keeps encountering unfortunate situation after unfortunate situation. The story held my interest a lot more than some other classic novels I have read. My only complaint was a few times certain plot points were belabored. I found myself saying, "Okay, I get it, let's move on."So, everyone, if you remember a book from your youth with less than enthusiastic fondness, it might be worth giving it another shot. You never know what you might find!
43619257	Whew! I finished this one this morning, and I'm glad I finally read it. I can't say, however, that I enjoyed it, would recommend it, or will ever read it again.Not in this lifetime, anyway. For starters, I didn't like Jane. Yeah, when she was a kid, I felt sorry for her, but the older she got, the less I liked her. Her religious convictions and the decisions she made because of them had Bertha looking like the picture of sanity by comparison. Speaking of, why in the world did she wander off in the middle of the night with no money?What did she think would happen? Was manna supposed to drop out of heaven? And I don't buy that an educated, sensible woman would just run off into the night without taking enough with her to make sure she could survive. An idiot would have better sense than that.But by the end of the story, I was almost wishing she had wandered off after St John and contracted some disease. The fact that she didn't totally realize what an awful freak St John was nailed the lid on her coffin to me. Even at the very end of the book, she kept talking about all of the great works he was doing for God. Seriously? He was an ass, and I would have told him to give me my five thousand pounds back! At least Brontë had the sense to kill him off at the end. Well, maybe he wasn't quite dead yet, but he was on his way to meet his maker. Ugh.I also thought it was more than just a teeny bit fishy that she ended up on the doorstep of the only family she had in the entire world. Exactly how likely is that? Not very. Then there is the man himself, Mr. Rochester. He wasn't anything to write home about for sure. Let's start with the obvious, shall we? He was cold, condescending, and secretive. Wow. Oh yeah, and he was ugly to boot. Yum. Can anything else be said about him to make him more of a catch? I know! Just in case, let's have him keep a drooling, homicidal wife hidden away in the attic! Personally, I think Brontë had covered all the bases at this point.Did he honestly not see anything wrong with letting her marry him while he had that crazy bat of a wife locked upstairs? If he had just told her the situation to start with, I might have liked him a little better. Nah. Probably not. I never actually figured out what she saw in him. My best guess ended up being low self-esteem coupled with a bad childhood. The 'gothic mystery' part of the plot ended in the middle of the book, and shortly thereafter, anything remotely interesting. Say what you will about Looney Bertha, but at least she pumped some life into the story.And wasn't it just awesome that Bertha burned the house to the ground and then leaped to her death? Nice exit, big girl! I gotta say, she was by far my favorite. Lest we forget, she also managed to mangle Rochester's good looks even more before she bowed out. Now Jane's man looks like a one-eyed, one-armed, flying purple people-eater. Of course, she doesn't mind, because now she feels she can be of use to him. Jane, I can tell we will never see eye-to-eye on things, so I'll just let it go. Our friendship was never meant to be. For some, you will forever remain the stoic heroine who finally gets her Happily Ever After. For me, you are just a ninny with bad taste in men. As Adele would say, Adieu. Reader, this review is over.

690097576	For years I've been saying that Jane Eyre is my favorite novel of all time--and that it is. The character of Jane is, to me, one of the most admirable and appealing fictional characters of all time. Poor and plain she may be, but her spirit is indomitable.In an era when women were expected to be brainless and ornamental, Jane (through the words of Charlotte Bronte) refused to bow to those expectations
5202040	** spoiler alert ** SPOILER ALERT. YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU PLAN ON READING JANE EYRE.I read Jane Eyre for the first time as an adult and I can't help but feel sorry for every junior high or high school student who was forced to read this book. I thought getting through this book was very difficult. I assumed I would love it since I generally love books by Jane Austen, but I didn't find many similarities at all. Jane Eyre was boring and unbelievable. I did enjoy the first half of the book because I had such hope for her, but then it just became dull and unrealistic. I never bought the romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester, nor did I buy the coincidence of her happening to arrive on the doorstep of the only relations she has in all of England during her time of need. I also find it strange that she dedicates the last paragraphs of the book primarily to St. John Rivers, when he was such a small part of her life, not to mention the fact that the part he did play was primarily negative.Bronte failed to draw me into the lives of these characters or like them, frankly, which made this a very long read for me.
133727125	The Brontes fuelled my love for reading and convinced me that the classics weren't all mean, nasty books that fascist teachers made you read in school just to torture you. I grew up with Austen and Dickens, whom I loved, but the Brontes always seemed to come out on top for some reason. Jane Eyre is my second favourite after Wuthering Heights. I love the darkness and sadness of their novels, but the more... quiet style than you'd find in Dickens's wild tales of orphans, drunks and epic family betrayals.

533793285	I'm bumping Jane Eyre up to the full five stars on this reread. It has its Victorian melodramatic moments (horrible aunt! and cousins! (view spoiler)[mad wife secretly hidden away in the attic! heroine starving in the wilderness! (hide spoiler)]), but overall I found this story of a plain, obscure girl determined to maintain her self-respect, and do what she feels is right even in the face of pressure, profoundly moving. And I'm a romantic, sorry/notsorry, so that aspect totally sucked me in too. And it really is a great romance, at least in my book, but it's just so much more than that.Reasons I Love Jane Eyre:1. Jane is no beauty. There's no Cinderella moment. Deal with it. Her beauty is all on the inside.2. Rochester is not gorgeous. This is not going to change either. In fact, his outward appearance gets worse in the end. And it doesn't matter! When's the last time you read a romance where neither the heroine nor the hero was good-looking?3. Great dialogue. Rochester makes sarcastic comments to Jane all the time. She sasses him right back.4. This is a romance of the mind and the heart, not just OMG HE'S SO HOT AND HIS LIPS MAKE ME MELT. (Though there's definitely physical attraction here too.)5. Jane maintains her pride and self-respect. She sticks to her principles, even when the pressure's on, even when it would be much easier, and would bring her much more short-term happiness, to let those principles go hang.6. Jane Eyre takes a very nuanced view of religion: there are hypocrites, in at least a couple of different variations. There are hard, cold people who sometimes use religion as a tool, or an excuse for what they do. There are saintly characters who always turn the other cheek. And there are believers, like Jane, who are imperfect but are doing the best they can. 7. Jane teaches us that we have a great power to take control of our lives and decide our own destiny, even when the cards are all stacked against us. It's up to us to take action to change our lives, not wait for someone else to change it for us.8. Jane Eyre empowered women, written at a time when in so many ways we were considered second-class citizens. It still empowers us now.Women ... feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.Buddy (re-)read with Jess, Karly, Vane, Kristin, Rabbit, and Andrea.P.S. The Kindle version available for free at Project Gutenberg has wonderful pencil drawing illustrations.Bonus: excerpts from Texts from Jane Eyre: And Other Conversations with Your Favorite Literary Characters **spoiler alert**JANEMY LITTLE SUNBEAMWHERE ARE YOUI NEED YOU BY MY SIDEI’m taking a walkbe back for dinnerAH YES MY CAGED SPRITECOMMUNE WITH NATURE AND UPON YOUR RETURNRELATE TO ME THE VAGRANT GLORIES OF THE RUINED WOODSdo you really want me to describe my walk to youMORE THAN ANYTHING YOU POCKET WITCHit is fairly cloudy outlooks like rain soonAHHH TO THINK THAT MY LITTLE STARLING JANESHOULD RETURNTO PERCH ON MY BROKEN MALFORMED SHOULDERSINGING A SONG OF THE GREY AND WRACKING SKIESMAKES MY HEART SWELL TO BURSTall right—JANE WHERE HAVE YOU GONEI AM BEREFT AND WITHOUT MY JANE I SHALL SINK INTO ROGUERYi am with my cousinsWHICH COUSINIS IT THE SEXY ONEPlease don’t try to talk to me againIT IS YOUR SEXY COUSIN“ST.

3822038634	He amado cada página de este libro como no creí que fuera posible. Sin duda la relectura me ha hecho disfrutarlo infinitamente más, no sé si es que me he hecho más romántica, más blanda o qué pero en fin, que me he enamorado de cada página, de cada matiz de la historia.Me quedo sin duda con dos cosas, por un lado con la ambientación oscura y fantasmal y por otro con el personaje de Jane que ha conseguido colarse entre mis predilectos (y eso que la primera vez que leí el libro me pareció una sosa, ¡¿En qué estaba pensando!?)Rochester no tienes perdón como ser humano pero como personaje eres de 10 xDEn fin, una lectura maravillosa e inolvidable que además he tenido el placer de compartir con mis brujos del Aquelarre, lo que lo hace todo mucho más disfrutable***Eso sí, después leed 'El ancho mar de los Sargazos' de Jean Rhys para descubrir la parte de historia que nos falta.......

190950478	One of the most beloved novels in history for many generations ; "Jane Eyre" is set in England in the 1800's . The story of a neglected girl orphan of that name who never gives up her dream of happiness, no matter how remote a possibility, this goal can ever be reached. Hated by her cruel Aunt Mrs. Sarah Reed (NOT A BLOOD RELATIVE), and cousins Eliza, jealous of her more beautiful but spiteful sister Georgiana, and abused by them both. They look down at the beggar, this little poor girl this imposition, why is she here ? They show every day their contempt, not even bothering to hide it . It would be so nice everyone thinks, if Jane wasn't there. Her miserable, tormented life seems everlasting no escape, where would she go ? And treated like a lowly servant not a loved relative, she the orphan has to keep her feelings to herself. Bessie the nurse maid, is the only person that treats Miss Eyre kindly, secretly of course. The frosty aunt very reluctantly raised Jane, until the age of ten, then gladly Mrs. Reed sends the unwanted prepubescent Jane , to a charity school Lowood's, run by a clergyman the tyrannical Mr. Brocklehurst, he forgot the teachings of Jesus . Harshly treated there too, as are the other students (Jane is hungry and cold, often), by the director Brocklehurst, a man that believes in discipline, except for his own luxury- loving family ! Jane grows up a lonely woman with few friends, only one in fact fellow student Helen, (here for a short time) she hopes there has to be something better than mere existence. Leaving the horrible school after eight long years, the last two as a teacher the teenager gets a job as a lowly and paid little, governess , in a gloomy mansion far away. Her new "master" is the rather distant and frightening Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester, a mysterious man that spends little time at home. Jane becomes attractive to the not very attractive Rochester, many questions are left unaccountably unanswered at Thornfield Hall. The little girl Adele, the governess teaches and takes care of sometimes. Along with her French nurse, Sophie, is she Rochester's child or just his ward ? Those strange horrific noises up on the third floor , dreadful, devilish and inhuman laughs in the middle of the night, what is causing them ? How did the owner of the house make all his money ? Will Rochester marry the beautiful but greedy woman Blanche Ingram, she despises Miss Eyre and make her leave Thornfield Hall. Will the plain Jane ever find a place to call her own and find love and contentment ? This classic book written by one of the brilliant but short- lived Bronte sisters Charlotte, will not disappoint readers of great literature, still worth the effort after more than a century and a half of its existence ... it will continue for who knows how long ?
1560239333	This classic beauty reminds you that everyone deserves a love that burns, aches, tears at your soul, opens your heart, and brings pure joy. Even if that love comes with consequences…Jane Eyre is a kindred spirit, full of passion, intelligence, independence, wit, charm, and overall a magnificent human, bringing meaning to the phrase 'character development'.Jane grows up in unfortunate circumstances. Upon the death of her father, she is raised by her vile aunt, who not only disdains Jane’s existence but is abusive. Locking her up in rooms, ignoring, and taunting her. She is an uncouth human, jealous at her core. You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. When Jane moves to an orphanage, she lives in dreary circumstances and does not discover better conditions until her last few years. She befriends a dear girl named Helen, a light in her darkness. Helen is the one person who treats and cares for Jane, but soon, she, too, dies. Arriving at Thornfield, she takes the role of governess to Mr. Rochester's guardian, Adele. The uncanny bond that forms between Mr. Rochester and Jane happens much later in a peculiar, gorgeous, slow, endearing, passionate, epic way. Jane finally feels she is safe: I grieve to leave Thornfield...I have not been trampled on....petrified. I have talked face to face, with what I reverence with what I delight in. I have known you Mr. Rochester... As the book progresses, we see small moments, hidden gestures, and stolen glances, all ebbing toward love. I love you as my own flesh. You-poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are... A dark secret threatens to destroy the pure, tranquil love and bond between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Jane's perfection is her ability not to let it break her. She picks her independent soul and moves forward, searching for a morsel of semblance and untrusting happiness. Jane Eyre is a beautifully eloquent story of a woman chasing after her own respect and independence. It may be the most feminist book to date. Jane doesn't relent, and she doesn't break. She keeps growing, building, and evolving. This isn't the typical 19th-century novel about a histrionic woman who is dramatized and entitled to give in to the whims of plainness or a man. It is the story of a woman who steps one foot after another in mud, snow, and the trenches of her torture to keep living beyond her pain. Do you think that I am a machine? That I can bear it?Do you think because I'm poor, plain, obscure, and littlethat I have no heart? That I'm without soul?I have as much heart as you and as much soul.And if God had given me as much beauty and wealth,I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you When Mr. Rochester asks her who will care for her, she says, "I will care for myself." I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself Here is my truth: I have read many, many books. I've liked books, I've adored books, but nothing comes close to the feelings I have towards Jane Eyre. Character development, arcs, writing, drama, mystery, and romance—Bronte covers every single base, leaving me spellbound.The book was atmospheric, romantic, and mysterious at once. I savored every minute, reading only when the mood was perfect—preferably on a gloomy, rainy day. In its dark, romantic moments, it closely resembled Thornfield.I love you, Jane Eyre. It’s hard to process you're only a character and not perfectly real.Ahhh, this quote can make me weep--when does someone desire to know you from your depth? Rarely.... You are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?’'I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.’ Mr. Rochester is a brooding, soul-sacrificing lover who has been defining books and period dramas for decades. He has the ultimate passion, mind-bending desperation, for Jane; like religion, he revels in her existence. I was reading with gritting teeth as he teased and tested Jane to conjure her innermost thoughts—he felt them, too, yet the passion sat between them like an unwelcome guest. It is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly The beauty of Jane Eyre, the novel: an uncanny ability to bring the reader inside Jane's very thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. With wretched beginnings, we carry her burdens and revel in her slightest joys. It's like no other book, worthy of all its accolades.5+ shining, brilliant stars.(Also, if you haven’t watched the latest Jane Eyre [2011], don’t walk; run to stream it! So well done, gorgeous!)

From its very first pages to the last heartwarming words, it’s captivated my interest and remained a staple of my library for over ten years. Of course, I have my other favorites, but Jane Eyre is in my top 5 all-time favorites. I'm forever a Brontë girl. I own so many beautiful editions of this book, along with Wuthering Heights - and I don't think I'll ever stop collecting them. I actually just went and purchased another edition last night with my capital one points lol. Don't judge.ೃ⁀➷ ★ ₊ ˚ 𝓠𝓾𝓲𝓬𝓴 𝓢𝓾𝓶𝓶𝓪𝓻𝔂 ꕤ༊*·˚Jane Eyre is a work of Gothic melodrama and is told in first person by the titular character. Jane’s story opens with her living with a harsh guardian who treats Jane more like an unwanted inherited antiquity than a member of the household. In time, Jane is sent off to a boarding school run by a religious fanatic but eventually escapes through employment as a governess. At Thornfield Hall, Jane is under the employ of the broodingly enigmatic Edward Rochester. In time, Jane’s hardened heart begins to soften not only towards Mr. Rochester but also towards some persons who once wronged her. However, Jane’s path to happiness is not a smooth one as she suffers disappointment and heartbreak only to receive a well-deserved happily ever after.ೃ⁀➷ ★ ₊ ˚ 𝓜𝔂 𝓣𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓰𝓱𝓽𝓼 ꕤ༊*·˚We follow Jane, an orphan who goes to work at Thornfield mansion as a governess to Adele. When she catches the eye of her formidable employer, Mr. Rochester, it seems that Jane might finally achieve her happy ending. However, Mr. Rochester is hiding a secret that will not only threaten their fledgling romance, but force Jane to choose between her heart and her principles.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ What I love about the plot is not only its simplicity — boy meets girl, they fall in love, obstacle comes along, happy endings all round — but also the gritty twist in the middle. I mean, who could imagine that Mr. Rochester would have a wife still living? One can imagine him perhaps having a child, or even a destructive gambling habit, but not a wife still living! Of course, in that day and age it was a scandal to have a bigamous marriage, and to this day it’s still illegal, but the twist that it brings is wonderful to read.Naturally, the torment it brings Jane is also exquisitely crafted, from running away from Thornfield, to the doomed courtship of St John Rivers, and her return to Thornfield only to find Rochester blind. It keeps the reader hungering for more. Of course, a happy ending does ensue, which is a little bit clichéd, but it does tie all the ends up nicely. ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ It’s almost like a summer storm in a way – gorgeous sunny outlook followed by rain, lightning and thunder, and then finally the calm after the storm when it still smells like rain.Who could help but love Jane? She’s every girl’s dream big sister — feisty, intelligent and fiercely loyal to those she loves. That being said, she does display a lot of naivety in the beginning of the book, probably because she is so desperate to be loved. However, this dissipates throughout the book and we see Jane grow from a naïve young girl into a strong woman who can more than hold her own.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ What I enjoy the most about Jane, and the reason that she is my favorite character, is that she never lets her heart rule her head. Even when it means losing the man she loves, she refuses to enter into a bigamous marriage and instead tells him to love his wife, who is as mad as the hatter! When Bertha eventually dies, it does free her up to marry Rochester, but she makes sure that he is well before entering into a marriage.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ Rochester is also one of my favorite characters. Brooding, difficult to deal with, and stubborn as a mule, but ultimately a kind man with a loving heart. Sadly, he’s a bit too used to having his own way, and doesn’t appreciate Jane saying “no” to him, which is rather amusing at times. However, when Jane returns, he is unable to believe it and nearly pushes her away again, something that immediately causes the reader to panic. Thankfully, he’s able to recognize her in time, and all is well. The best thing about Rochester is that even when he’s blinded and all but incapacitated, he is still commanding and rugged — exactly as we remember him.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ Jane Eyre can be daunting when you first read it, namely because the language is so different from the style employed nowadays. However, once you get past it, the story is fantastic The description in the book is also excellent, inspiring passion and raw emotion in the reader, while still keeping the book, as a whole, grounded. Bronte’s ability to evoke the wildness of Rochester and the fiery passion of Jane is tempered with the sensibility of Mrs. Fairfax and the childishness of Adele, as well as the snootiness of Miss Ingram (who I think every girl comes to despise!) and the bad-tempered nature of Jane’s aunt and cousins.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ All in all, the book is well-rounded and should be a staple of everyone’s library. I cannot recommend it enough! It’s one of those books that just transports you to another era and another time, when courtship was about more than Facebook statuses and problems were solved by talking rather than texting.And yes, that is the main reason I read it — not just because it’s fantastic, but because it brings me back down to earth and reminds me that sometimes it’s better to turn the computer off and try things another way.｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟ⋆✴︎˚｡⋆ Connect with me on Instagram ˗ˏˋ★‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹

226621688	‘It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.’One would be hard pressed to find a stronger female character than Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre. She is a staggering figure of feminist literature, rejecting, or rather, dismissing the notions of social class and many gender roles as she moves upward from her humble beginnings. I was floored by how incredibly enjoyable and poetic this novel was, and how it would resound equally well with audiences of either gender despite being often dismissed by males. With Brontë’s strong feminist themes brilliantly illuminated through her enviable prose and engrossing characters, Jane Eyre truly deserves the title of Classic Novel.One cannot help but fall in love with the character of Jane Eyre. I went into this novel expecting simply a variation of Austen, and was pleasantly surprised. Instead of being focused on the proper workings within proper society, I found a total rejection of these notions in the character of Jane. Still being pleasant and strong willed like Austen’s leads, Jane climbs the ladder of society without stopping to consider her place within it and often criticizes class based distinctions. Although she is merely a governess, she aims for the heart of the ‘Master of the house’, and even after certain events would no longer require her servitude, she is quite insistent upon maintaining employment and an income. She is like a Victorian era punk, totally bent on independence. Mr. Rochester is another lovable character, despite his being a complete pompous ass (which totally won my heart). It is interesting to note that Brontë toys with some of the ideas of romantic plots as well. It is usual for the romantic couple to be attractive (look at Hollywood), yet Brontë is quick and often to point out that neither Jane nor Mr. Rochester are particularly pleasing to the eye, and have a difficult countenance. Brontë’s use of language is widely impressive, having a keen eye for detail and distinction in both natural descriptions and dialogue. It was difficult not to speak like these characters in real life (which would have probably earned me a punch to the mouth), the writing and speech is that infectious. It flows for pages with a strong current without becoming dull in the long descriptive passages and accounts. In short, Brontë writes with the best of them.Fleshing out this story is the theme of sin and forgiveness. While being heavily grounded in religion, Brontë dismisses the standard notions of the day in that regard as well, affording a deeply moral lead that is still able to criticize religious standards and have ambiguous religious beliefs. Jane is quick to judge her actions based on moral principal, but cannot allow it to keep her from being her independent, free-willed self. The most powerful moment of this novel, however, is that only after the sins of her lover are purified in flame and paid in flesh, that the two are able to meld in heavenly bliss. If you haven’t read this, well, let’s just say I’m shaking my head at you like a disappointed father. I jest, but really, give this a try. Brontë is truly a master, and this book gets literally crazy. And for once ‘literally’ truly means literally, you’ll see. Jane Eyre is a wonderful character to follow through this novel and upon completion you will have ‘ acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy’4.5/5
1105516313	I understand this book is feminist for its time, but I think that while it opened one door, it simultaneously closed several others. First and foremost, I'll just say that if this were a children's book about a young orphan overcoming guardians who abuse and look down upon her, then it would have been quite enjoyable (and blessedly, half the length). Instead, it was rambly and forced me to sympathize with racist and abusive characters. So although I liked that Jane stood up for herself and was likely a role model for a lot of women, she embodies such classic white feminist ideals that it was difficult for me to translate this book's message into having any sort of modern value. For one, both Jane and Mr. Rochester esteem this book's only mixed race character of color as a beast, a lunatic, and various other words with negative connotation. Also, Mr. Rochester's solution for her insanity is to lock her up in his attic for years. The entire middle of the book that dealt with this conflict handled both of those topics so insensitively. Then, there was the issue that all of the men in this book, despite Jane's supposed strength, were such crybabies about hearing the word no. Usually, this came in the form of rejected marriage proposals that threw men into tantrums. One of the most iconic situations involving this is Mr. Rochester threatening violence on Jane for resisting his advances, then blaming the anger on her that she would cause him to be so impassioned. The entire logic of this being a feminist work was entirely backward for the entire romantic side plot of this because Jane consistently endured his threats, and even by the end of the book when they are equals as she sought for them to be the entire time, she still calls him "master."Maybe my reading of this book could have been softened and the questionable parts justified by giving me a deeper reading of the text, but reading it for leisure with no background studies was concerning. When I wasn't slogging through long-winded passages and reading the book out loud to my cats just to combat sheer boredom, I was questioning why people esteem Jane and Mr. Rochester to be such great characters despite their clearly problematic remarks. Maybe I read it too literally and maybe I'm not giving it enough credit for being groundbreaking for its time, but this really wasn't for me. (Unless, like I said, the first half of it was published separately as a standalone. But the romance was definitely not my thing.)

381486147	I often think of classics as "required reading," usually accompanied by a barely suppressed groan. Because, surely, they can't actually be any good. I'm not sure why I've always associated well-known and well-loved classics as such, but I suppose it must be the expectation to love it just as much as the world. It's silly, I know. A person can't be expected to love all books, classic status or not, but still, I wondered if I would enjoy it.Jane Eyre is one of those novels that proves me completely wrong and I'm glad of it. It is not beloved simply due to its age or progressiveness or pretentious nature, but because at its heart it's a damn good book. Lyrical, emotional, and captivating, Brontë makes you beg and plead sweet, emotional reprieve. You hunger for it, but she holds on to it ever so slightly -- not to the point of frustration, but instead leaves a trail of bread crumbs to keep you from starving. And the best part is that you delight in every moment. Brontë made my emotions work for that happily ever after with the irresistible OTP: Jane and Mr. Rochester.At the same time, while I thoroughly enjoyed the romantic aspect, I was also equally intrigued with Jane Eyre's life in general. While at times she lived under horrible circumstances, her resilience was nothing short of admirable. She never let her hardships define her as a person or let it compromise her morals even when she was at her lowest. In the end, her luck does turn around and she finds happiness, which at times I felt was way overdue.Thandie Newton's narration was even better than I expected. Her voice brought the novel to life and at times, I could have sworn several different people narrated instead of just her. It was very apparent that she had a healthy amount of respect for the novel, and her reading, imparted the same into me. It felt like her voice said, "These words are amazing, this prose is magic, this story enchanting. I'm thrilled to be reading them to you. Let's bask in in Brontë's brilliance together." Who could say no to that? I was very impressed and believe listening to this version was the best decision for me. I never was once bored because Newton demanded all my attention.This is the first time that I've read Jane Eyre and I'm glad I did at this point in my life where I'm fully able to appreciate the various themes conveyed. That's not to say I wouldn't have understood certain things, but I'm sure there are lots of books where we come away thinking, "Wow, this was exactly what I needed right now." It's even more surprising and intriguing that it's a novel written over 100 years ago that appeals to me even now. Ah, the joys and magic of literature!All the things that I love in a good book was here and more: masterful character development, interesting plot, and OMG, the witty dialogue. I could have read an entire book composed of Jane and Mr. Rochester's banter alone!This book brought me many happy sighs and I'm thrilled to have found a new all-time favorite in a classic tale. Definitely an oldie, but goodie for sure.More reviews and other fantastical things at Cuddlebuggery.
3667456491	When you have mandatory reading at your teenage times(as you embrace your dumber and more irritating version of herself), having an old classic on your list could be compelling and demanding for your mental state! Because you’re inexperienced and witless to understand the true meaning of extraordinary literature! So I confess my first waltz when I was young, dumb, clueless and annoying brat in sixteen didn’t go well as it’s planned! I only concentrated the love story part of the book as like other teenager girls who only want to see flying hearts and flowers above their heads! And I honestly disliked Edward Rochester so much! I truly wished Jane get marry with someone else. (Like someone 90210’s Dylan McKay)Can you believe it? And now when I reread this novel, retaking my journey with a little wiser mind, so many things have changed ( I still think she can find a better candidate for herself but eventually I enjoyed the ending!) I honestly admired the amazing mind of Charlotte Bronte at several times! Because she published this book in 1847 and she pointed at so many sensitive issues in this book including slavery, gender equality, abuse, education, partners’ roles in the marriage. She’s bold, brilliant, a powerful queen of feminism. This book is a heart wrenching but also truly inspirational story of a young orphan girl: her discovery of her identity, her dreams , her life purposes, her rights to choose the love of her life to spend her life with. She wants to find her own worth, capabilities while chasing her dream to be teacher then a governess. She also searches for the true love and finally she finds it after all those struggles and pain she endured. After her neglected childhood with her abusive aunt who sends her girls’ boarding school, she starts making new friends and slowly finds her interest to be an educator. She starts to teach at the same school where she considers as her real home and age 19 she decides to become a governess which ends as she starts living at Thornfield Hall where she meets Mr. Rochester: an unhappy, dissatisfied, rude, introverted man who is distanced himself from her. But as you can guess, more time they start spending together, closer they get and see their common interests as so many haunting, unexplainable things start to occur at the mansion. And eventually Jane leaves Thornfield for living with Rivers family. And her distanced, a man of few words clergy cousin proposes her but ... you know how it ends, don’t you? But don’t worry! Jane is strong character. She chooses herself at first and she is resilient and wise enough how to choose her true happiness. The author’s brilliance and remarkably unforgettable characterization earned my five gazillion stars! I’m so happy for stop being dumb teenager and appreciate the true taste of amazing novel! Here are my some favorite quotes: “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.”“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.”“Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.”“I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.”“If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.”“I am not an angel,' I asserted; 'and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me - for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate.”
68656307	Now I know why Charlotte Bronte said this of Jane Austen: "The passions are perfectly unknown to her: she rejects even a speaking acquaintance with that stormy sisterhood". I love Jane, but Charlotte REALLY knows how to write about passion, romantic or otherwise. If Jane’s books are stately minuets in which the smallest gesture has its meaning, Charlotte’s is a spirited, sweeping tango of duty and desire. A perfect blend of passionate romance, gothic mystery, romantic description of nature, social commentary and humor, all rendered in vivid, gorgeous prose. One cannot help to admire Jane Eyre, the little governess who could. She rises above her harsh upbringing to become a governess, poor but ever fiercely independent. Even the promise of love and comfort with the man that she worships is not enough to sway her from the path of integrity. One cannot help to admire Charlotte, who makes her intensely human; a woman of virtue, yet one who is not above jealousy and doubts, and who constantly struggles with the personal cost of her decisions. A deeply felt, and ultimately moving story of love and redemption that will linger long after the last page is turned.
1098949000	I just finished this book in the early hours of the morning, and I'm left with a heavy but happy heart and a smile on my face. I clung to those last pages like nothing else - not wanting the story to end - and this is even a reread for me. This goes to show how much I love this book and this journey of Jane. I think what I love the most is exactly the fact that it takes you on an amazing journey, and Jane changes so radically from beginning to end. As a reader, you are rooting for her and your feelings are on their peak from the very first pages when she's being treated so cruelly. Another thing that makes me love this book to pieces is tbe fact that the two main characters are not beauties - the hero and heroine are actually quite ugly, but they find each other - maybe exactly because of that. Finally, we get a story which is not about perfect princesses or handsome princes - this is about common people and that makes it SO MUCH BETTER! I will say that the men in this story raise questions and they are quite unbelievable at times. They behave in such a way that is hard to understand for a modern reader; but I guess that was common back in the days. Nevertheless, that doesn't degrade the book for me in the least. This was a reread for me, but I kept being surprised anyway by the story and the twists and turns. This is a MUST READ and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Beware, because you will be taken on a most wonderful and amazing journey - and good luck!
1284832713	I don't like love stories, but I read this book because I love Brontë sisters. Unfortunately for me, I must say that I liked it, even if it is not my favourite type of book at all. I love how Charlotte described Jane; a very strong person in every sense, very stubborn (in the good way), and especially how she struggled for the love of her life, how she suffered when she was a child, even a grown-up, how often she cried and she was about to give up... but no, she finally reached happiness after a very long battle against fate and (why not) herself. In my opnion, Charlotte's message was clear: If you have a dream, go for it!This also describes Charlotte's life, so I understand how she could write such a good book. Jane Eyre: A very well-described character and an amazing woman in every sense.
2334592261	It was a good idea to let this digest before leaving a review. My initial reaction was maybe 3 stars. Then I started to think it over, read literary analysis and historical context. I also watched the exceptional 1944 movie starring Orson Welles and adapted by Aldous Huxley (author of Brave New World) and realized just how great the story is and how well it accomplished major themes of cruelty, especially in religion, and what it means to be loved.That said, I think there’s still room for criticism. The fact that a 90 minute movie can stay virtually 100% true to a 500 page book and leave little out indicates that there’s a lot of excess in the novel. Perhaps it was less irksome to its original readers, when Jane’s moral dilemmas were more serious, but modern readers may struggle with hundreds of pages of worried thoughts over what will seem like trifles.It’s still a page-turner though, and if you can stomach the intermittent boring parts, the juicy moments will grip you to the end. Definitely a must-read classic!
192635093	Rochester abuses mentally ill wife. Jane complains a lot.
858312468	Famously, the most interesting character in Jane Eyre barely gets to say a word. The mad woman in the attic. And oddly, at face value, Bronte seems to imaginatively and emotionally have shunned her. She's largely a piece of Gothic stagecraft. So, Bronte ignores the gagged and shackled woman - perfect symbol of the historical plight of women in general up to that point in time - to concentrate on what might be interpreted as an adolescent romantic wish fulfilment narrative. (Jean Rhys perceived this missed opportunity and wrote an entire novel about her.) But then it's interesting how everyone else in this novel is hell bent on making the rational decision at every turn. Even Jane is continually rationalising her sexual passion. An overload of rationality in any circuit and you're always going to get the unacknowledged screaming prisoner in the attic. It's an oddly, wholly unintended Jungian novel. (I'd argue that one sign of genius is the ability to unintentionally anticipate ideas you haven't consciously formulated). You might say Jane Eyre is the blueprint for all romance fiction and of all the great novels is the one that has spawned the greatest amount of trashy reading matter. In many ways it's the literary teenage girl's dream book. And I thoroughly enjoyed reconnecting with the inner adolescent female. But it's frankly baffling why so many women read nothing but romance novels and therefore pander to that adolescent girl throughout their reading life. I'd give up reading if every novel followed the Jane Eyre blueprint! It's also interesting that one could make a case that both Jane's suitors are sadistic tyrants. As if for a woman at that time it was simply a question of choosing your poison. Mr Rochester, for all his rather overly manufactured charm, is after all imprisoning a woman he probably had a hand in sending mad. Part of Bronte's wish fulfilment agenda is to see the male physically disabled, as if only then will his tyrannical authority be toppled and he be capable of acknowledging and dramatizing vulnerability. Woolf criticised Bronte for allowing her bitterness at the reprehensible lot of women to seep into her writing and it's true that at the back of romantic fantasising there's almost always a catalyst of bitterness. Bronte ultimately creates a world in which a "plain" woman might thrive but in many ways the requisite conditions are as far fetched as you could imagine. It's a fantasy that in the 19th century must have seemed as remote as the planet Mercury. All that said, this is a triumph of compelling storytelling. However, I was left feeling Emily was the real genius in the family: she was more innovative and went much deeper into the human psyche. Which is why I'm now going to reread Wuthering Heights.
6682198364	As an orphan, Jane Eyre spent her early years living off other people’s kindness. To escape her aunt’s constant emotional abuse, she chose to go to a remote boarding school - Lowood. It wasn’t really the charitable place it claimed to be; instead, it was all about exploiting kids. So, Jane endured 8 years of hardship there, even though her inner spirit stayed free.Once she finally grew up and could choose her own path, Jane boldly left Lowood. Fate then led her to Thornfield, where she encountered unforgettable moments that would change her life.Meanwhile, young Rochester - born into wealth - was tricked by his own family into marrying a woman who wasn’t quite right. Since church law didn’t allow divorce, he felt trapped by duty and couldn’t move on, which left him spiraling into despair.At Thornfield, these 2 troubled souls ended up meeting.Sometimes love just hits you out of the blue. Even though they came from totally different worlds, after lots of conversation and time together, Jane discovered the deep pain and kindness hidden beneath Rochester’s gruff, moody exterior. And he saw in her a confidence and understanding that spoke to him. Bit by bit, their hearts grew closer.Spoilers Ahead!When a wedding couldn’t be held in the church - and the truth eventually came out - the sweet taste of love turned bitter for Jane. Even though she couldn’t let go of Rochester’s genuine feelings, she made the painful decision to leave Thornfield in search of a new life.While spending time with a cousin who was all about missionary work, Jane became even clearer about what she truly wanted. Then, on a stormy night, following Rochester’s call, she returned to Thornfield.By that time, however, Thornfield was unrecognizable - a massive fire had burned everything down. The “crazy” wife had set the blaze and perished after falling, and Rochester, injured while trying to save others, was left disabled, never the man he once was. Yet, in the end, these 2 true lovers finally got their happy ending.What makes Jane Eyre so moving is that it feels like real life. It isn’t a biography, but in many ways, the Jane Eyre created by Charlotte Brontë mirrors her own past - experiencing a tough, unhappy childhood, dealing with discrimination at home, enduring unfulfilled love, and clinging to books and learning in search of warmth and inner peace. Brontë’s deep reflections on life and love just shine through.Even though Jane appears small and fragile, she’s got an inner strength that can’t be broken. Her genuine, intense emotions and the vivid ups and downs of her inner world make you feel like you’re right there with her. That emotional power leaps off the page and touches your heart, turning a fantastical story into something real.The whole novel is cleverly crafted, with twists and turns that vividly capture Jane’s strong, independent, free-spirited, and passionate nature. The writing is beautiful, full of keen insights into the mind, and peppered with lyrical descriptions of nature, all reflecting the shifts in Jane’s moods. The rich, intense emotional tone is a true testament to Brontë’s writing talent.Even though the story is set in 19th-century Victorian England, even today many girls might not have the kind of confidence, independence, and decisiveness that Jane shows. And plenty of people might not have the guts to choose their own path like she did.At her core, Jane was just an ordinary girl fighting against fate. Every choice she faced was incredibly tough, but she always had a clear, rational sense of who she was. Whether it was going to a harsh boarding school, leaving to work as a governess, walking away from a forbidden love to start fresh, or coming back to embrace a love that was whole - every decision she made was true to her heart, letting her firmly take control of her destiny.That’s what I love most about Jane Eyre - and what makes this novel so deeply moving. Only a woman with a strong inner core, brave and independent, can truly live the life she wants. It’s an undeniable truth.Before long, I’m determined to let my daughter read this book because I believe it teaches every woman the real secret to a happy life.5 / 5 stars
1344030281	As wonderful as ever on each reread.
5864432973	Passion begins outside our beds. Before it comes, it is born first in our minds. Bronte knows this. As I was reading, my reaction was to fling my own pen aside. I drew a line at breaking my fingers. Besides, she would tell me that pain is part of it. Keep on writing. This is the most honest account of desire that I've had the privilege to read and wish to write. Movies try to come close. Some do better than others. But the book surpasses them all. How? By taking the time to share Jane's thoughts, the passion has a chance to build to its full force. Page by page, this book throbs.
2753053275	"Cada nuevo capítulo de una novela es como un nuevo cuadro en una obra teatral".Qué sensación de vacío te queda al terminar este libro, no lo quería acabar, me maravilló.La pluma de Charlotte Brontë es fantástica, ame la narración, me encantó cada vez que Jane Eyre se dirigía al "Lector" como una persona a la que ella le estaba relatando su vida. La historia desde el principio es interesante, me encantó la personalidad de Jane Eyre a sus diez años, su manera de pensar era muy distinta a la de sus primos, ella pensaba ¿Por qué tienen el derecho a tratarme diferente cuando soy igual que ellos?, Y tenía tanta razón, ellos creían que por qué Jane no era agraciada y rica merecía ese trato, nunca me cayó bien ni la tía ni los malcriados de sus primos, odie como la trataban. Y al mandarla a la escuela para que aprenda a comportarse como una "señorita", siento que Jane nunca perdió su escencia, ni su manera de pensar, pero su comportamiento cambio muchísimo, a lo cual es entendible.Lloré un montón por lo que le pasa a Helena, me encantaba esa nena.Jane después de salir de la escuela, por qué quería conocer nuevos lugares, consigue un trabajo como institutriz en la casa del señor Rochester. Y a mí me encantó ese hombre.No es perfecto, lo describen como feo y gordo, pero me enamore completamente de él, me encantó su actitud con ella, y respecto al gran "problema" que pasa entre ellos dos, estuve de acuerdo con Rochester, si no tenía a la mina ahí, la mandaba a un loquero (yo lo hubiese hecho), fue muy amable de su aporte aceptarla y cuidarla.. lo que si no estuve de acuerdo es con que no lo haya dicho antes.Adele es una niña tan querible,al igual que la señora Fairfax, algo que me gustó mucho es con lo que pasa al final con la tía de Jane, una persona que odia toda su vida a otra, incluso hasta en su último respiro seguirá odiando a esa persona y no cambiará por nada en el mundo y eso fue tan real.Lo que me cansaba es que todo el mundo dijera siempre lo mismo de Jane, "no es tan agraciada, no es bonita", me molestaba mucho, para mí Jane siempre fue hermosa, ya que su personalidad es atractiva y su manera de pensar. Lo mismo de Rochester, los dos son hermosos y punto. En fin, me encantó cunado Rochester le dice a Jane que le encanta sus ojos de color marrones y Jane dice "Lector, en realidad tengo los ojos color verdes, pero por el momento por ahí fueron marrones", AY me encantó, se tomaba el tiempo de explicarnos todo a cada momento, sin saltarse nada.Después del gran problema, si se me hizo algo lenta la lectura hasta que Jane llega con esas personas, lo cual me encantó que ella encontrará a esas personas, esa chica necesitaba cariño de familia y ellos se lo dieron.Y el final, el final fue hermoso, me sorprendió, me encantó, me cautivó... Todo.Amé los celos de Rochester, aunque no estoy muy de acuerdo con lo que hizo Jane, pero ¿Qué otra cosa podría haber hecho?. Al final se volvió independiente como ella siempre lo quiso y con un gran hombre a su lado. Amé las palabras de Rochester y como Jane relataba como terminaron todos sus seres queridos y cuando preguntó. "Lector, ¿Acaso se olvidaron de Adele?",.yo dije en mi cabeza "claro que no" y ella ahí dice "yo tampoco", fue como charlar con alguien, por eso amé la escritura de esta obra.También lo más destacable de todo es el modo de pensar de Jane Eyre, para aquella época era difícil que alguien pensara como ella lo hacía y por eso siempre fue auténtica.Directamente ya sabía que este libro me iba a encantar, y al final me maravilló.No hay más que decir, recomiendo esta obra muchísimo, obviamente haré una relectura cada tanto.Las hermanas Brontë tuvieron un don para la escritura, todas escriben tan diferente, pero cada una con su originalidad. Nunca me podré decidir entre Cumbres Borrascosas y esté, me encantan por igual.Una obra maravillosa. Y sin dudarlo va a estar entre mis mejores lecturas de este año.
3443630594	pinnacle of literature as far as i am concerned
2038379049	There are two things about Jane Eyre that have stayed with me over the years.1. The author's use of a pseudonym to get her work published.2. The vivid social commentary by the intelligent and independent protagonist.I read the book years ago when I was 12-13 years old and I didn't understand the significance of the pseudonym until much later. Currer Bell was a male pseudonym. As it turned out Charlotte Brontë's first novel The Professor was never published during her lifetime, and the themes of the second novel made it very clear that it will be even less likely to be published unless a change was made. So, the novel was released as a male perspective of a female mind. “Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.”Rightly said, Miss Eyre. Striving against prejudice is a central theme of this book. The social commentary involves controversial scenarios of the time: the treatment of women, orphans, the poor, the illegitimate children in society. The book criticizes the Church as an institution and its lack of impact towards creating social harmony. For example, the descriptions of Lowood.But above social stigma rises the question of the choice of a woman. The right to not be judged for her actions when choosing to love or not love. To be able to confront a world face to face without being questioned of her intentions. This, truly, is where the book most struck a chord inside of me as a reader. The fact that Jane refuses to compromise and makes her own choices at will makes the me respect her more as a reader.I also enjoyed the horror elements: the gothic structure of Thornfield and its ghosts and its lacklustre parties and shadowy recesses.Overall, I can safely say that I loved the experience of reading this classic. I've definitely found one of my favorite female protagonists of all time.
2294695387	Most of my thoughts while reading this book can be summed up with, "WTF Mr. Rochester?" Since this book is centuries old, I'm gonna spoil the heck out of it right now, so beware.First off, who dresses up as a Gypsy woman just to mess with people's heads?Who fakes an engagement to make another woman jealous?Who then tries to marry said woman when they already have a wife?Who keeps their aforementioned crazy wife in the attic?Who tries to convince the love of their life to stay by their side by recounting all the women they've slept with?Mr. Rochester, that's who. And so Reader, this is why "WTF Mr. Rochester" was constantly on my mind. Because seriously, WTF Mr. Rochester.All of that said, I did really enjoy this book, and strangely enough, I really did like Mr. Rochester. Does Jane deserve better? Maybe. Do I totally ship the two of them together? Heck yeah.Jane is straight up savage and I love her for it. She talks back. She's sassy. She's highkey vicious with her responses. She's strong headed. And she definitely has far more tolerance for Mr. Rochester's antics than anyone in the world would ever have.While Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights will always reign supreme in my heart, Charlotte Brontë's novel has also made it pretty high on my list. Now all I have to do is read a book by Anne Brontë and see what happens.
3197821479	“I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had the courage to go forth into it's expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst it's perils.” I like how masterfully Charlotte Bronte is able to establish both mood in tension in Jane Eyre. I see that even in the book's opening paragraph: "There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question." The way Bronte sets the scene of the poor orphan, Jane, evokes Jane's mood and condition perfectly. The feeling that Jane is confined is immediately reinforced by her treatment at the hands of her Reed relatives. She escapes this condition, first to Lowood and then to Thornfield Hall where she becomes a governess. While I like some of the twists in the second half of the book (namely, the madwoman in the attic) I've always been happier with the first half of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. The focus of the second half of the book is on Jane and Rochester's courtship. Not sure what I'm missing, but I don't understand Rochester's appeal. He is cold and arrogant and feels sorry for himself. He does have a passion for Jane, but is she more of an escape from the madwoman in the attic than someone he genuinely cares about? Until the end at least, when Rochester has changed, I'm never quite sure about his love for Jane. Compared to St. John, Rochester is a wonderful prospect. St. John is manipulative, self-serving and does everything he can to bend Jane to his will. What does it say about Jane that she nearly marries him? I do like Jane as a character, but sometimes wonder, most especially with St. John, how she can view him sympathetically. And speaking of sympathy, I am intrigued that, beyond the fact that Rochester is married to her, Jane has little interest in Bertha and Rochester's life together or how Bertha came to be the madwoman in the attic. Though she has sympathy for nearly everyone in the story, Jane has remarkably little (or no) sympathy for this inmate of Thornfield. <>That said (and the meme thrown down), I was pleasantly surprised by how clear and accessible Bronte's writing still is. So even though I wasn't swept up by Jane and Rochester's courtship, I appreciated Bronte's writing and enjoyed the read!
6097344813	4.5⭐️ Jane and Mr. Rochester are sooooo dramatic I want to give this 5 stars 🤭 but also Jane and Mr. Rochester are soooooo dramatic I do not want to give this 5 stars 😭***my first Charlotte Brontë novel!! ❤️ longggggggg overdue find jane eyre on amazon/kindle 🤎
4526747909	Jane Eyre c’est moi!Rubo la citazione dello scrittore francese per adattarla al classico inglese di Charlotte Brontë.Leggere Jane Eyre è diventare Jane Eyre: è amare Edward Rochester, vivere a Thornfield, essere l’istitutrice di Adèle, tenere testa a St. John.Mi sono completamente immersa nella lettura di questo libro e ne esco... ricca.
357585251	2025 review:On my fourth journey through Jane Eyre, I loved it even more than the previous three times I read it. It's a brilliant book, one that still has something to say over 175 years after it was first published. You can find my thoughts from my 2019 reading of it below.2019 review:“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.”“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.”This is my third time reading Jane Eyre, and it’s a book that just seems to get better and better every time I pick it up. There are quite a few classics that I love, but this novel is among my very favorites, tied with Frankenstein for the top spot. Classics are vastly different from modern fiction, and have to be read differently. Now that I understand this fact, reading classics has become much more fulfilling for me. “You are original,” said he, “and not timid. There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye.”First of all, the writing is absolutely gorgeous. Charlotte Brontë penned one of the most beautiful novels I’ve ever read. Every word she wrote had purpose and power. In this book we have the story of an orphan girl’s journey from surviving to thriving. Life has dealt her a hard hand, but she handles herself with surprising aplomb and grace through even the hardest situations. Jane is different, and marches to the beat of her own drum. So much so, in fact, that many critics refused to believe a woman had written the book when it was first published. There are times when Jane bends over backwards to try to please those in her life because she is so desperate for the love and family that she never had, but she always has a line that she won’t cross. When pushed too far, Jane always firmly stands her ground and refuses to lose her identity to those who wish to mold her into their ideals. “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me.”That’s one of the most powerful lines I’ve ever read. Jane always remembers her free will and her freedom when faced with those who wish to take those inalienable rights from her, and she always defends those rights. Even in the face of losing that which she yearns for most in the world, she will not be caged or forced to compromise her principles.We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence.Another thing I really loved about this book was that Brontë’s faith that shone brightly from the pages. There was much theology and scripture and soul searching in this book. But what I loved most was the fact that it never felt forced or trite. Faith was as much a part of Brontë’s time as breathing, and is portrayed just as naturally. It is the core of Jane and was exquisitely rendered, because it was also the core of Charlotte. I love this quote from the the foreword:Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.And, of course, there’s the romance that this book is most known for. It’s beautiful, but it’s not what stands out to me. While it might be the most famous aspect of the novel, it is not the central theme. In my opinion, Jane Eyre is the story of a girl overcoming hardships and finding herself, and always protecting that identity. Without a doubt, this is in my top five favorite classics. And without a doubt, it is a book made for revisiting.“…if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.”
1784023965	One of my reading goals is to read as much classic literature as I can. And I am glad that I chose this book. Jane Eyre tells a story of a very likable personage - orphan girl Jane Eyre who, after her parents' deaths lived with her aunt and three cousins who heartily hated her, then at the age of 10 she was sent to a special school-orphanage where after spending 8 years she became a teacher and later a governess at a rich household. As the story progresses we see Jane mature from a young rebellious thing to a fine, upstanding, sweet natured woman, who is headstrong and determined, independent and completely selfless person.Narrated in the first person, Bronte's writing instantly draws the reader into the story, compelling me to keep reading. I found the book incredibly hard to put down. The way the story unfolds is mesmerizing, and it is so intelligently written and absorbing. Having never read any works of Charlotte Brontë before, I was quite skeptical about Jane Eyre at first thinking that this is going to be like another Cinderella story (about a kind orphan girl who is cruelly treated by the people around her and in the end found her happily ever after). Jane is such a likeable character and I am sure most readers identify with her, even today, after its first publication in 1847, her situation and predicaments are something we all experience at some point in our lives. It is no wonder that this story has stood the test of time, and I am sure that in future this fine example of English literature will have its fans as much as it does today.Read Jane Eyre, I urge you, you will not regret it!
4140185247	Leer Jane Eyre en el siglo XXI es gratificante y más aún para la época en que Charlotte Brontë lo escribió. Es una historia con un personaje femenino que no envejeció nada mal, y que a día de hoy se sostiene intacto. La historia es contada por la misma protagonista y nos sitúa desde que era una niña que compartía vivienda con la esposa de su tío y sus tres hijos; del cómo no pudo seguir viviendo allí porque se negaba a estar al lado de personas que no la querían y la trataban fatal. Luego, pasó al internado Lowood para niñas huérfanas donde abundaba la miseria y los malos tratos por parte de un clérigo fanático e hipócrita con su misma religión; para finalmente a sus dieciocho años convertirse en una institutriz que por voluntad propia trazó su camino llegando a la casa del señor Rochester; donde por fin la verdadera trama tendrá cabida debido a un oscuro secreto que aguarda en Thornfield Hall.Jane es un personaje que desde pequeña se va perfilando como alguien activa, inquieta por adquirir conocimientos y saber más sobre el mundo; alguien bastante despierta y apasionada solo en los momentos donde al fin logra sacar todo lo que lleva dentro. Es una chica que sí, para su época perfectamente pudo ser rebelde, atrevida, respondona y bastante criticada y maltratada por familiares, conocidos y desconocidos. Considerada bestia salvaje, una pequeña demonio, un ser incomprensible y largos etcéteras más, pero es justo allí donde radica su encanto: salirse del canon al que estaban impuestas todas y cada una de las mujeres de esa época. Jane Eyre tiene una personalidad fuerte y decidida, no teme en pensar y actuar diferente a la norma convencional. Es alguien que en definitiva me ha conquistado con ese temple firme y arrollador; porque nunca, nunca decae. Siempre sigue la ruta que ella desea con gran tenacidad. A pesar de lo mucho que tenga caídas y picos emocionales (porque también tiene sus debilidades como todo ser humano) por su aspecto físico, su clase social o su condición de intitutriz; siempre toma sus propias decisiones, aquellas que considera correctas para ella. Y de eso es lo que estoy completamente seguro. Jane fue la que forjó su propio camino, paso a paso; sin seguir la estela que otros/as quisieron marcarle. Y créanme cuando digo que hubieron varios hombres y mujeres que intentaron moldearla, doblegarla, hacerle creer que lo que ellos decían era cierto, pero para suerte y admiración mía, todo fue en vano; Jane Eyre se mantuvo íntegra desde el comienzo hasta el final, fiel a sus ideales y principios y no a los que la sociedad le marcó desde pequeña. Y sí, es una historia mucho más dulce y sana que Cumbres Borrascosas; con un romance bastante meloso y basado en la igualdad y en el respeto que se profesan los implicados pero no por ello una unión perfecta. Eso sí, es de esas relaciones que te enternecen y que quieres que se lleven a cabo cuanto antes porque no aguantas la espera. Y aunque no es una lectura tan intensa todo el tiempo y que genere sensaciones ambivalentes como la de Emily Brontë; esta brilla con una protagonista excepcional. Ah, que es cierto, que ya lo he hecho muy obvio. Pues lo siento, no me importa repetirme hasta el hartazgo, porque me cautivó Jane Eyre y el magnífico viaje que representó conocerla y reconocerla como una mujer libre y dueña de sí misma.
5514706045	A tale of morality, marginalisation and soul-binding love. This book captivated me, from the integrity and strength of Jane’s character, to the intimacy it builds between you and her. This book feels like a conversation with a friend, a personal diary to read. Jane speaks to you, about her world, about her. The symbolic use of nature, the trials and tribulations of loss and solitude,the emotive and all consuming depiction of love- but for once, with a woman shown as not losing herself to a man, to the need of marriage, but finding it, embracing it, on her terms. A true pursuit of happiness, genuine happiness, in a beautiful story. (I cannot put my love for this book into words. There is so much more I could say. )
901441228	Ahhhh I GOT SUCKED IN.Me: I never read romance, it's my least favourite genre, it's so cringe-worthy.Also me: These two are destined to be together, their love is so pure, it's so romantic *starry eyes*I mean at first I wasn't sure how it was gonna go, with the school beginnings. I was ready for a long-winded boarding school experience but it was mercifully short and actually kinda fun and she totally didn't get bullied like I thought she would so it was entertaining! Then she moved into Thornfield and okay, we all knew that romance would ensue, but I didn't realise there was this mystery too and I was so excited, thinking to myself, 'ooooh I got a sneaky ghost story with my dull romance plot! Score!'So anyhoo, it proceeded mostly as expected with the entertaining fun of the mystery, and then when things inevitably went pear-shaped I legit had no freaking clue what was going on. But props to Ms Bronte, because it gave me a solid appreciation for how everything wrapped up and totally converted me.I mean, I think historical romances are probably a little easier for me to appreciate because there's decorum and tact and class as opposed to insta-love and hot steamy explicit scenes. I like the feeling, and the relationship between Jane and Mr Rochester strikes me as being a truly authentic representation of modern love and relationships. It's not about the other person being perfect - just being perfect for you. SO ROMANTIC.So yes, here I am revealing my mushy interior because this stupid love story got to me.Well played, Bronte.This was book 20 of my #Dymocks52Challenge refined. You can read more here.

364757771	I just really love this book. Jane is such a strong strong character who does what she believes is right no matter what and the SASS is so real. I love it.As per usual, I loved it, though I feel like the older I get the more I notice the seriously problematic things in it.But Jane is still the best.
4139420454	Una de las mejores novelas de la era victoriana y de la literatura en general. Jane Eyre es una historia que envuelve y abruma tanto por lo espléndidamente narrada que se halla como por la complejidad mental y emocional de sus personajes que desafían en incontables ocasiones los convencionalismos sociales de la época. Es quizá esta rebeldía latente lo que dota a la obra de un encanto atemporal.Jane Eyre, nuestra protagonista, se nos presenta en primera instancia como una niña huérfana bajo la tutela de una tía que la desprecia y que acaba deshaciéndose de ella al enviarla pupila a un colegio donde lejos de despegarse de las nociones de carencia pasará a atestiguarlas como nunca. Esta primera parte tiene un tono marcado por la soledad y la búsqueda de afecto, el temperamento indómito de una niña, el miedo casi supersticioso al mundo y la brusquedad de un entorno azotado por la enfermedad y la muerte. La autora consigue crear una atmósfera dura y ciertamente devastadora en la que brillan, por momentos, ciertos milagros como la amistad.Pero lejos de limitarse en las penurias o inquietudes de una niña, la obra avanza para que sigamos a Jane durante su juventud y madurez mientras leemos, en una narración en primera persona, su búsqueda de independencia que la aleja de la institución donde creció y la lleva al sitio donde la espera un insólito amor que la hará cuestionarse todo lo que concibió sobre la sociedad y sobre sí misma. Un amor truncado por circunstancias ajenas a ella que demandará decisiones sacrificadas que condicionarán una vez más el rumbo. Aun así, bajo el peso de un destino que parece modificarse constantemente y la dura luz de una sociedad donde las posibilidades de felicidad parecen ligadas al nombre y el estatus, Jane Eyre se rehusará a dejar que otros decidan por ella o la encarcelen en voluntades que van contra sus principios.Dotada de una gran decisión, de un juicio justo aunque critico, de una irrevocable percepción de sí misma, de un hábil intelecto y una mordaz capacidad para el diálogo, Jane Eyre conquistará al señor Rochester pero también a sus lectores. Es una protagonista magnífica, rica en matices, de fuerte temperamento pero de un admirable control sobre su expresión. En sus argumentos y contraargumentos con Rochester presenciamos no sólo el nacimiento del amor y las limitaciones que les impone la época sino que nos deleitamos en el humor insólito que nos ofrecen.Jane Eyre es, sin dudas, un clásico. Quizá por la fuerza de su protagonista, el deleite que representa el romance o como nos seducen sus giros inesperados. Quizá por la crítica que alza contra los prejuicios de una sociedad que margina, divide y aplasta. Quizá por lo peculiar que resulta poder acompañar a Jane desde la inocencia de la infancia hasta la madurez. Quizá por la espléndida e incomparable pluma de su autora. Quizá por todo lo anterior y por algo adicional que esta lectora es incapaz de capturar en palabras pero Jane Eyre es, ciertamente, una experiencia avasalladora e inolvidable.

570803661	The funny thing about this novel is not how enlightened it is for the time period, because it really isn't all that enlightened, right Mr. Rochester? How's that first wife hanging in the attic? Or how closely aligned to modern ideas of equality between the sexes and finding an equitable arrangement between them it is, because it only happens to conform to the standards of romantic literature of the time, where happy endings happen. Windfall out of nowhere? Really? Trope, much? And how does that subvert anything except as to put Janet on an *externally* equal footing? Being balanced in monies and station is not the same thing as having a true meeting of minds and hearts.Fortunately for us, all the plot twists are secondary to the one thing that she and Mr. Rochester have in common, and that is a true meeting of minds and hearts, and while the idiot manages to really crap it up, it seems that only an enormous act of god or authorship or pandering to trope could possibly put Jane back into a position of strength where she can tell the rest of the world to **** off and do what she wanted to do, originally.And that's what this novel is really about. It's not about the plot. It's about the internal character of Jane Eyre. She's wholly her own person, and that, more than anything, is more subversive than anything else in this novel. She's not bucking the male-dominated world. She's not setting off to have adventures. She's not even telling people off unless they push her to it, and she has no qualms about being subservient or going dropping all of her happiness in a big pile and storming off to hold to her personal ethics.That's the point. She knows herself. She knows her limits. She knows what she wants. And even if she doesn't always know how to get what she wants, she knows what she'll settle for and precisely what she won't settle for. She follows her heart, her own judgement, and nothing that anyone might ever say to her would ever change that.There's plenty in this novel that might annoy or outrage modern readers, of course, but this one simple fact about Jane is what lets it transcend all other considerations, or indeed, time itself.This is a great novel. :)
1093519797	"Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis: Times change, and we change with them." - Except, apparently, when it comes to Mr. Rochester.Melinda reading this book in her teens:I admire Jane Eyre from the bottom of my heart—her strength, her integrity, her unshakable principles. She faces hardship with grace and refuses to compromise herself.…But what on earth makes her fall for a guy like Mr. R.? He’s old as the hills, surly as a badger, and definitely not handsome.Well, if he is what Jane needs, so be it. I am happy for her.In her twenties:Still admire Jane. Still in awe of her inner strength.But that R-guy? Total A-hole.And no, don’t even try to compare him to my beloved Mr. Darcy. He doesn’t deserve to shine Darcy’s boots.Anyway, I have to write a uni paper on this—so let’s do it.In her thirties:Jane? Awesome.Rochester? Patronising bastard.Also: how did this guy get cast with all the sexy actors, hmm?!In her forties:Jane remains a marvel—albeit a touch self-righteous and maybe a little too holier-than-thou for my taste, oh ... and despite her taste in men, apparently. Rochester: still a selfish, manipulative bastard & never mind the fact that he was played by all those great actors on film. Not that St. John Rivers would have been any better. Jane didn’t need either of them. Honestly, she’d have done so much better solo.Reader, I still admire her. But Reader, I’d have swiped left!And now... the years keep rolling on. A reread is looming somewhere in the near future as "Melinda-in-her-50s" is warming up offstage, expecting her entrance.Time flies when you're busy (re)reading great books.
639314	well, i can do that, too.CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH REVIEWS*(*entertainment purposes only)HAMLET v. JANE EYRESetting: World Courts buildings, Den Haag, Netherlands; a closed-session hearing...Judge: I have agreed to hear this case, but I must admit to both parties that we are in uncharted legal territory. Both parties must understand that I have very little administrative guidance with which to make a decision. This is a very public dispute, and the fate of a nation rests on my decision, so my decision- which is binding and final- will rest heavily on what I think is in the best interests of the Danish people. Agreed?(all parties nod in agreement)Judge: (to Hamlet) Prince Hamlet, I must admit: I’m astonished that you come to be in my court today. I thought you were dead by poison from the blade of Laertes.Hamlet: A sub-lethal dose, it turns out, your Honor.Judge: (nodding) Well, during your period of coma and internment in your family mausoleum, young Fortinbras here claimed your kingdom, citing the documents we reviewed earlier. (pauses to read some legal notes) Some of the changes made under Fortinbras’ rule have been very popular with the Danish public. The court is reluctant to overturn his claim.(to Fortinbras) And who is this woman sitting with you?Fortinbras: Your Honor, this is Jane Eyre, Governess of the Rochester Bank of London- which is the IMF’s (International Monetary Fund’s) appointed agent for the establishment of a Danish central bank, and the restructuring of the Danish economy.Jane Eyre: (nodding deferentially) Your Honor..Judge: (nods) My lady…Hamlet: Your Honor, the creation of that central bank you mention is a point I’d like to address immediately. The gold coin of my father’s realm has been stable for centuries. The fiat notes Ms Eyre and her cronies would print bear no true value. (produces chart) This chart here shows how every fiat currency in history has either failed, or is in the process of failing. (motions to chart)every fiat currency has failedJudge: (looks over his glasses at the chart, then over to Jane) This seems quite compelling, Ms. Eyre. What have you to say about this?Jane Eyre: (condescending) A modern, elastic currency is the only way to capitalize economic growth in Prince Hamlet’s backward little country. His people are living in the… well at least the 16th century, if not earlier.Hamlet: Yes, it’s true, we haven’t had the Agricultural Revolution yet, but we need that to happen before we can industrialize… in order to free up manpower off the farms.Fortinbras: (sniffing derisively) Ridiculous! The World Bank has already done an analysis of the Danish economy, and endorses our plans to industrialize immediately. We plan to get the necessary human by importing food and forcing displaced farm labor into the cities. By importing medical advances as well, we can also extend the population‘s lifespan, which will produce more slaves, er, labor force.Judge: (conflicted) Medical advances are a good thing…Jane Eyre: (triumphant) Yes, for starters, the Rochester Bank of England has begun construction of the Ophelia Memorial State Mental Hospital in downtown Elsinore.Hamlet: (indignant) To be administered by a Mrs. Poole - a close personal associate of Ms. Eyre’s, it turns out! This is but one of many examples of the cronyism and corruption this IMF restructuring has brought to Denmark’s fair shores!Jane Eyre: (with a subtle nod and wink to the Judge) Naturally, the IMF reserves the right to appoint able and vetted candidates of its own choosing, to oversee its projects…Hamlet: (pointing at Fortinbras) And this scoundrel would enslave my subjects in servitude of debt… borrowing from the World Bank to fund a massive hydroelectric power plant!Judge: Hydroelectric power? That sounds good to me. It’s infrastructure.Hamlet: Infrastructure is great, but how about something relevant to the local economy? We aren’t industrialized yet… what do we need all that electricity for?Jane Eyre: RBM (Rochester Business Machines) wants to build a factory in Denmark for the manufacture of circuit boards…Hamlet: (standing up) Yes, at slave wages! Why not grow local businesses? Why not build port facilities to help the already-extant Danish fishing industry? Why not facilitate domestic trade by building roads and railways? Why not improve public health by building a solid waste treatment plant?(motioning in Fortinbras’ general direction) THIS sort of infrastructure mainly benefits IMF cronies, who move in and exploit my subjects!Fortinbras: (offended) “Solid waste”? How lewd!Jane Eyre: (irritated) Judge, this Prince is obviously an insular autocrat who wishes to keep his people in the Stone… er, Elizabethan Age! His resistance to our humanitarian assistance is an injustice to the Danish people, a threat to free trade, and a refusal to peaceably enter into to the community of modern, enlightened nations. He’s a terrorist!Judge: (appalled) A terrorist?!??Jane Eyre: (meekly) No? Um… well, I meant figuratively speaking. An “intellectual terrorist”, if you will.Hamlet: (pleading to Judge) My kingdom merely wishes to neither a borrower nor a lender be.Judge: (thinks for a second) Hmmm… yes… because loan oft loses both itself and friend.(Hamlet nods and smiles)Judge and Hamlet in unison: And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry!Judge: (standing up) YES!! I see your point exactly, fair Prince! This court hereby recognizes the government of Prince Hamlet of Denmark, and declares all claims of Fortinbras’ on that kingdom to be null and void! (bangs gavel loudly several times)(Fortinbras and Jane Eyre stand up, outraged)Fortinbras: Oh, wretched villainy!Jane Eyre: YOU CAN’T DO THIS!!! YOU JUST MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE!!! YOU JUST TANGLED WITH FORCES GREATER THAN YOU CAN POSSIBLY COMPREHEND!!(Jane rushes at the Judge, but is held back by a bailiff)Bailiff: I’m sorry, Ma’am, Judge Birdopoulos has made his ruling.Jane Eyre: (shaking her fists at the heavens) NOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo!MATCH POINT: HAMLETNarrator: …And thus a tiny country was rescued, which would grow to one day be the greatest economy on Earth, and which saved the rest of its fellow nations from a great Dark Ages, when the great collapse of fiat currencies came.THE END.

4646916231	The language and emotions were what I loved the most in this Audible studio production. I have listened to Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, narrated by Thandiwe Newton. Having listened to it with joy, I can say that Jane Eyre is the kindest woman I have come to. Everything that had happened to her didn't make her bitter else. She was smooth and delicate throughout all good and bad days. Her childhood, and upbringing, made her such a good person. She found her peaceful days with her beloved one.

1731369100	Dejadme aclarar una cosa antes de empezar a hablar de este libro: yo no soy una persona de clásicos. O al menos, hasta ahora no lo era. Los poco que he leído no me han parecido tan maravillosos como a todo el mundo. No me habían causado una gran impresión, y ni de lejos consideraba a alguno como favorito.Pero este libro, Jane Eyre, se ha ganado un trocito en mi corazón para siempre. Por mucho que lo intente, no voy a ser capaz de expresar todo lo que me ha gustado este libro, pero voy a intentarlo.Esta es una novela dura, con un ritmo lento y desgarrador que detalla al máximo todos y cada uno de los sentimientos que cruzan la mente de Jane. Creo que nunca en mi vida he comprendido tanto a un personaje siendo tan diferente de él. He vivido el pesimismo de Jane, de su manera “frívola” de ver el mundo, de su desconfianza hacia todo y de su evidente falta de cariño. Me he sentido casi tan triste como ella misma cuando le ocurrían cosas malas, y he sonreído como un idiota cada vez que encontraba algo de felicidad. No tengo ni idea de cómo sería la personalidad de Charlotte Brontë, no tengo ni idea de si Jane es un reflejo de la escritora o de si es enteramente ficción. Pero sea lo que sea: bravo.Sin duda ninguna, Jane es un personaje al que admiro con toda mi alma. Me ha encantado ver cómo un personaje del siglo XIX se revelaba contra todo aquello que le habían enseñado, cómo se negaba a ser una mujer callada y obediente, y levantaba la voz por aquello en lo que creía. Por muy mansa que pueda ser en algunas partes del libro, siempre está presente ese espíritu luchador en sus pensamientos que tanto he admirado. Jane es simplemente maravillosa.Si me conocéis aunque sea un poquito, sabéis que no suelo disfrutar de las historias de amor. Y de hecho, esta tampoco la he disfrutado; la he vivido. Aunque a veces me ha sido imposible comprender al señor Rochester, he amado con locura su relación con Jane. No suelo entender el amor, no suelo aguantar las curislerías, pero la forma que tiene la autora de describir la admiración y la pasión que sienten el uno por el otro es simplemente increíble. Reitero una vez más: a pesar del amor que siente Jane por el señor Rochester, sigue fiel a sus principios. No se doblega ante su “amado”, como se supone que debía hacer cualquier mujer de la época. Y eso me ha encantado.Y sinceramente, no sé qué más puedo decir de este libro. Me ha parecido una obra maestra de principio a fin. He vivido este libro como he vivido pocos, he disfrutado con él desde el mismo momento en el que lo empecé. Estoy sin palabras.No soy ningún pájaro, ni estoy atrapada en ninguna red. Soy un ser humano libre con voluntad propia, que pongo en funcionamiento para dejarlo.
925410545	SPOILERSI dedicate this review to my dear friend Jeffrey. jeffrey, you are incredible friend and a writer and you should never, ever change.Jane and Mr. RochesterMore than once I have come across criticism on Charlotte Bronte for fully failing to understand Jane Austen. Charlotte declares her incapable of passion. And while I cannot agree with this assessment, after my second reading of ‘Jane Eyre’ I do understand why someone like Chatlotte Bronte sees someone like Jane Austen this way. If Lizzie Bennet is a breath fresh air, charming and witty, Jane is force of nature. In the face of a storm Lizzie will be next to you, encouraging you and consoling you, while Jane will grab you by the hands, look you in the eyes and tell you “It’s over. You’re going down. Face it and do it right” Jane carries herself through light and darkness in equally graceful way. I may disagree with some of her views, yet, I am completely enthralled and mesmerized by her strength, by her determination to fight for herself, and the passion with which she defends her beliefs, regardless of whether I agree with them or not."I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will."Jane proved to me that freedom and free will are not the same thing. Does the slave, the captive, the sick one, the lonely one, have a free will? We are all captives in some way, we are dependant and we all suffer. Some more than others. Free will doesn’t go away with freedom. No walls, no humiliations and atrocities can devour it. I shall quote my friend Hades “Courage doesn’t always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’ Even in the face of most horrendous circumstances we have the choice, the free will, to decide whether we shall let our identity, our core, the sense of meaning, burn out along with our happiness, or we shall keep remembering that there is always tomorrow. Jane remembers, Jane hopes, Jane believes. Jane cares. I will never understand those who consider Catherine the personification of passion and free human spirit, and Jane just a meek, boring, insipid girl. Catherine is passionate about nothing and no one else but Heathcliff. And even this single source of passion doesn’t prove strong enough. She lets go of him and voluntarily confines herself into miserable marriage and devotes her existence to a life of bland luxury, lies and petty rivalries that make neither her, nor anyone close to her happy. This isn’t the face of passion and freedom. Jane is passionate about Mr. Rochester, about women's position, moral, religion, education. About people and the world in general. She has a really big scope. One that Catherine lacks. She knows herself well enough to know that being entraped in a relationship that goes against her instincts would ruin her. It is people endowed with passion and bravery that dare to throw away the shroud of the common, to peel the veneer and see what’s inside. She breaks the rules. She cares nothing for customs, social norms and others’ opinion. Her conscience is her only guide. Jane is adventurer. She longs for “the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour”."I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold. Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes."And this longing makes her to break free from prejudice, to remember that “women feel just as men feel; It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.” It makes her brave enough to have a relationship with an older, prominent, enigmatic, sarcastic, dominant, demanding man, even though many who have been victims of suppression and abuse would see such position as just another of its faces. Yet, she gives into it. She dares explore the forbidden territory, to jump in the deep without a safety net, and knowing that if it fails, there will be a hell to pay. At the time having a relationship with the boss wasn’t as easy as it is today."My eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face; I could not keep them under control. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless."Temptation. It is a powerful force and for a woman like Jane, endowed with rare sensitivity and sensuality, it is an even greater one. Jane is modest and calm, but on the inside she is full of "life, fire, feeling”. And she is confident enough to not feel the need to demonstrate and parade her sexuality. As Marguerite Duras says in “The Lover”, “You didn’t have to attract desire. Either it was in the woman who aroused it or it didn’t exist”. Just like she doesn’t feel the need to prove how strong she is. Her mild, calm nature is not a sign of resignation, but a sign of deep inner peace. Fervour and boldness are not the only weapons one might possess. Jane isn’t about effects, but results. She speaks little and calmly, but smartly. Two quiet words, said in the right way and at the right time, have a bigger effect than the most intense and colorful declaration. Everyone can attract attention by being bold and flirtatious, everyone can defend themselves by using strong language and even force. But how many of us can achieve those things without even trying? Jane’s strength and beauty are deeply intrinsic. They are part of her, and not something she needs to evoke. They provoke fear in the cruel, sanctimonious, narrow-minded Mrs. Reid and Mr. Brocklehurst, mollify the innate coarseness of Betsy, gain the favour of Mirss Temple, Diana and Mary Rivers, and the affection and respect of Edward Rochester and John Rivers. I shall quote Mr. Rochester himself."To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts - when they open to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break - at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent - I am ever tender and true."He understands and describes her character perfectly.With all said, Jane isn’t perfect. She has her inner struggles. She questions her principles, she suffers the temptations and dilemmas we all do. It takes her a lot to learn to handle her strong emotions. Both negative and positive. When she is faced with the same dilemma that haunts the protagonist of “Notes From the Underground”,“Which is better – cheap happiness or lofty suffering?”she is very tempted to choose what she perceives to be an immoral act, disregard of her most important values. Her inner struggle at those moments will stay with me. It touched me very deeply. "I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in, - with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death."In the end she adheres to her chosen path. But despite her choice of ”lofty suffering”, Jane is not judgmental and self-righteous. She proves exactly how gentle her heart is and how deep her mind when she is faced with Mr. Rochester point of view regarding relationships and the sanctity of marriage. She doesn’t share his view, yet, she isn’t scandalized, indignant or angry. She actually sees the sense in what he tells her, despite not agreeing to it. I think it is rare to be able to understand and accept an opposite point of view without sharing it. Time and experience have taught me that two opposite views can be equally valid and truthful. This is a woman able to see nuances. All said about Jane’s depth can be said about Edward Rochester too. I will never forget these words:"Never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable. I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her? Consider that eye, defying me, with more than courage - with a stern triumph. It is you, spirit - with will and energy, and virtue and purity - that I want: not alone your brittle frame."It only shows how well they know and understand each other. (Unlike Heathcliff and Cathy) The harmony they find in their disharmony proves the veracity of his earlier words:"It is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, - you’d forget me."The first sentence anyway. As the plot progresses, we see that, like in every great love story, nobody forgets no one. The way they bear their separation only supports his claim about the deep affinity between them. (sighing)Jane and John RiversThe other austere, dominant male presence in Jane’s life. He must be one of the most fascinating characters I have come across. He may not be the man you would want as a best friend or to marry to, but I find him incredibly exciting and thought provoking. I shall quote myself. Here’s what I say in my review of “Inferno””I would always choose the sinner who sins, but also forgives, over the saint who never sins, but never forgives either”The juxtaposition between John Rivers and Edward Rochester really instills life into those words. Charlotte Bronte seems to have believed the same thing, judging by the way she has constructed those two characters. And Jane somehow balances their features in herself. She possesses some of the convictions and prejudices of John Rivers. She is deeply religious and despite generally being able to see nuances, in some aspects, just like his, her view is too black and white. She too is used to very simple, moderate life, she too feels the need to help others. Only, unlike him, she realizes that in some aspects the best way to take care of others is to, first and foremost, take care of yourself. And this is where once again we witness her ability and willingness to see nuances. Unlike John Rivers, she realizes that when an idea, no matter how noble, turns into an obsession, might turn the devotee into someone as – and even more – dangerous than many egotists, opportunists and criminals out there. Rochester too is an austere, harsh man, but unlike John Rivers, he understands the other side too. He’s also full of love and tenderness and generosity. Not John Rivers, though. "What struggle there was in him between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is better for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress, he should trample them down"John Rivers, albeit good and great man – as Jane herself refers to him – is tainted by the fatal weakness of seeing people as just a big herd and himself as the shepherd who needs to lead and support it. He fails to see them as individual human beings, which is good neither for them, nor for himself. He is ready to sacrifice himself and everyone else he deems necessary to achieve his grand dream. He has a big heart, but a narrow scope. He struggles with every genuine feeling that comes to him."You are original, and not timid. There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. I declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am - a cold hard man."He is fanatic to the very core of his being and so lacking of confidence and self-esteem that he believes himself worthless without religion. To Jane religion is a dear friend helping her to keep her hope alive and make hard choices. It is essential part of her personality, but she sees it as something separated from her. She had her marvelous qualities even before turning to it. However, John Rivers sees his religious self as the only self that is of any worth. He affirms nothing else."You have taken my confidence by storm, and now it is much at your service. I am simply, in my original state - stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity - a cold, hard, ambitious man. My ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher - insatiable. I watch you with interest, but not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer."His words show that he too is possessed by a deep passion. But it is a cold flame that inflames it. His goal is noble, but not his ways. He rejects his individuality and that of others, the idea of happiness and self-indulgence. He forgets that every love is first and foremost love for the self. It is from this love that our love for others emanates. If we give up on ourselves, we give up on everyone else. If all you do is just give and give and sacrifice and sacrifice yourself, one day you will find that you have run out of substance and you have nothing left to give. And you will be gone, unable to help anyone with anything. And it will happen quickly. As it really does happen with him. But, as Jane herself proves, if you use your goodness and generosity sparingly enough and not forget yourself, you will be able to preserve yourself and therefore help others for a longer period and in a more quality way. Sometimes the best way to be strong is to let yourself be weak. I choose weak, but long-burning candle over bright and short-burning one. Jane is not as free-thinking as Rochester in some regards, but she does share his warmth, his willingness to forgive, the flexibility of his mind, his dream of happy and content life. She admits her own – and his – importance. It is always hard to decide how much to give to others and how much to keep to ourselves. It’s the hardest balance to keep. The one between the self and the world.With all said, I do believe that John Rivers, cold as he was, in his own way did love her. But he was too absorbed by his overblown idea of humanity and sacrifice and his refusal to see people as anything else than helpless victims and himself and Jane as the necessary sacrifice laid on the sacred alter and soon to be consumed. For awhile Jane is tempted. For awhile he is as big a temptation as Rochester. In the end though her spirit prevails, she breaks free, she remembers who she truly is and whom she needs to be with. The ending brought me so much happiness. I still stand by my claim that Mr. Rochester is the sweetest marshmallow of a man I have come across. And Jane agrees with me. Or, maybe I should say, I agree with her. This is one of my most favourite novels and, in some ways, the favourite. It was the book that made me realize that simplicity and depth don’t mutually exclude each other. It is a simple story, but it tells us so much. And Jane herself, she doesn’t possess the grayness we all appreciate so much in characters and consider to be making them deeper and more interesting. In this regard Jane is not complex – she is perfectly good, kind and amiable girl – but she is a deep character that speaks to me from the distance of 178 years. And I hear her voice. She exhorts me to be compassionate, to be strong in the face of adversity, to be equally kind to myself and others, to love myself and others willingly and openly, without shame, without regret, without reserve. She remains a quiet power in my consciousness that I will never separate with. Thank you, Jane.Read count: 2P.S. My only regret is that I didn’t provide Mr. Rochester with enough attention. I feel that I should have explored his character more thoroughly, so this review will probably go through a substantial redaction at some point. Otherwise it was a really nice experience.
402258978	Jane, Jane, Jane!!“I would always rather be happy than dignified.” "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you.” In spite of and in part because of its nineteenth-century gothic romantic roots, Jane Eyre remains one of the great novels, principally because it features one of the best characters of all time, a woman that fairly leaps off the page, a feminist for all ages. I am in agreement with Cecily in her fine review that this book is less a book of romance than it is about life, about being yourself and forging your own path.Oh, sure, it is (in part) about romance, about love, with lines like this to prove it:“I must, then, repeat continually that we are forever sundered - and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.”“I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you — especially when you are near to me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.”“My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"And last but not least: “Reader: I married him.”But it is not “he married me,” or “we got married” but this free, independent spirit making a choice, even a socially unpopular one, because she sees they are equals. “’Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. . . Will you ever forgive me?’Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.”Some of the plot is mired in nineteenth-century melodrama: the cruel school where Jane is being starved, the sudden, dramatic objection to the marriage, the madwoman in the attic, the sudden shifts in fortune, the surprising splitting of the fortune, the fire, the blindness (I am working to avoid specific spoilers here!), though some of that also obviously serves to entertain, within the gothic romantic genre. There is a lot of angst, for good or ill.But that call in the night, “Jane, Jane, Jane,” that supernatural call between souls, I say that works. Class matters in this book. Money matters. How you are perceived in society depends in part on how much money you have, and so it is fortunate that Jane comes into money (somewhat melodramatically) because without it the decision she makes could make her seem less than equal in some eyes. Both Jane and Rochester are destitute at points, they suffer, but you know, finally, it’s not about the money, either. Yes, you can starve, as a penniless orphan, poverty kills, but being rich is not as important as friendship and love.One (not I!) might think this fails to be a great book because of some of the above details, but the thing that makes it finally great is Jane, Jane, Jane. And the effort she makes to live a rich (reading, teaching, art, nature, great talk, family) and independent and principled life. And that in the nineteenth century she makes such a stand against the Calvinist preacher! “Conventionality is not morality.” And Jane is so good without being sappy. She resisted, she persisted, she perseveres! Wonderful book.
1341523658	Jane Eyre spans three genres and influenced them all: the loveless orphan finding a home at last, the school story, and the gothic romance with mythological undercurrents and an element of horror. We meet Jane as a scrawny and reviled nine-year-old living on the heartless charity of her Aunt Reed, enduring the abuse of her loutish cousin John and being punished for his transgressions. The penalty laid on little Jane on the day we meet her is particularly horrifying: she is shut in the so-called “Red Room” of the house where her uncle died, which is claimed to be haunted. Afraid for her life, the child pounds on the door, begging for release. Smoke poufs out from the fireplace; she takes it for a demon and faints.From this scene we are told all we need to know thereafter: the setting is England, the time uncertain (some place it as early as 1740, others as late as 1830), we are out in the country far from city or culture, the world is cold and dreary and hostile, there may be supernatural presences about, and this child is an orphan with not a soul on Earth who cares about her.Jane soon trades one unkind home for another when Aunt Reed sends her to Lowood School. There Jane learns all the academics and skills necessary to be a effective governess or schoolmarm.At Lowood, the sadistic headmaster singles bright, defiant Jane out as a soul to be broken. He humiliates her in front of her schoolmates, telling them to “withhold the hand of friendship” from her, and all obey him except a kind older girl from Scotland, Helen Burns, and the teacher Miss Maria Temple. (view spoiler)[Helen soon dies from a burst of cholera that sweeps through the school, killing half the student body, and Jane was further traumatized since she spent Helen’s last night lying beside her friend to comfort her, only to wake up next to a corpse whose eyes were still open. Miss Temple and Jane become close friends after this, but before Jane’s years of schooling are over, Miss Temple marries and moves away. (hide spoiler)]Thus, Jane is utterly alone upon ending school and embarking the first and scariest adventure of her young life. She hears of an opening for a governess in a fine house way out on the moors.Thornfield Hall is an opulent but gloomy place. Jane’s charge, Adele, is a sweet if shallow little French girl, the ward (and possible but unlikely biological daughter) of the master of the house, Edward Fairfax Rochester, who is almost never home, preferring to brood his way through the Continent. Thus says Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper. Something is off about all the servants here, but Jane can’t put her finger on what. She also hears creepy laughter some nights, but is assured that that’s just the servant Grace Poole. Grace is certainly an alcoholic, but she doesn’t strike Jane as mad, and the laughter she hears is of something not quite human and possibly demonic…Jane’s faith is strong, but she can’t help but worry.One inauspicious evening, she’s walking through the forest and comes across a rather obnoxious gentleman. His horse throws him, and he jokingly accuses her of bewitching the beast, telling her she resembles a sprite or faerie. She bears his strange teasing patiently and helps him back on his horse.Upon returning alone to the house, she discovers to her great chagrin that the odd-looking, odder-acting man in the woods was Mr. Rochester himself. He was fascinated by the spooky creature he met out there, and upon learning that she was the new governess demands to see her. They converse before the hearth, him shocked to discover that she’s just as smart as he is, her bewildered that this eccentric and worldly man is paying her any attention.Thus many evenings pass. Jane discovers that Rochester isn’t really mean, just abrupt and mercurial, and she starts looking forward to her chats with him. One night Jane hears the crazed laughter again and follows the sound to Rochester’s room, which is in flames at the moment. She rouses the man and together they douse the fire out. At this moment she becomes aware of a tension between them. She’s never felt like this around anyone and can’t explain it. Jane gets summoned back to her Aunt Reed, who is dying after a stroke. Aunt Reed is cruel to the last, but confesses that Jane’s wealthy uncle John wanted to make the girl his heir, and the only reason he hasn’t is because Reed told him Jane died during the contagion at Lowood School. Jane, being an incredible human being, forgives her aunt for this.She returns to Thornfield to find Mr. Rochester busy entertaining his fellow aristocrats, especially a beautiful but unpleasant young heiress, Blanche Ingram. Jane realizes at this point that she herself is in love with Rochester, but knows he’s out of her league on every level and struggles to squelch her affections. She hides her feelings so effectively that Rochester honestly believes she doesn’t care about him at all, and he whines about her “coldness” so often that pretty much everyone knows which young woman he really harbors feelings for. Blanche is most displeased at the presence of this mousy servant girl.One of the guests, a Mr. Mason from Jamaica, is attacked by something one night and Jane sits with him while he bleeds and Rochester runs for the doctor. Rochester decides to mess with everyone’s mind one evening by disappearing and reappearing a while later disguised as an elderly gypsy woman. He fools all his rich friends, and even Jane is briefly taken in. While playing fortune-teller, he tells Blanche something she didn’t want to hear, and while he tries to trick Jane into praising him it doesn’t work.He’s entertaining, that Mr. Rochester.Despite this little hiccup, Rochester goes as far as to get engaged to Blanche, all the while kvetching about how badly he’ll miss Jane and how she’ll forget all about him. Pushed beyond her endurance one day, Jane blurts out that she loves him and it would kill her to leave him. Rochester then admits that he really loves her, not Blanche, and calls off the first engagement to start a new one. Jane is thrilled by this development, but her intuition still tells her something is wrong. Rochester’s mood swings and impulsive decisions worry her, and while he used to treat her like an equal he’s started talking to her like she’s a little girl. His insistence on her wearing fancy clothes and jewelry makes her very uncomfortable. The night before the wedding a woman—or a wraith—breaks into Jane’s room and rips her bridal veil in two. When morning breaks, Jane assumes she merely had a nightmare, but the tear in the veil is still there. Rochester insists that it was only a dream, and Jane’s dread increases.They’re about to say their vows when (view spoiler)[Mr. Mason shows up again with some friends, claiming that the marriage can’t go forward because Rochester’s already married.Now we find out the real source of the demoniac laughter: Mason’s sister, Bertha, a violent madwoman. Many years ago, Edward was tricked into marrying Bertha, who was already losing her mind. She proceeded to terrorize her husband, even physically hurting him, and humiliate him with her sexual exploits. As her condition deteriorated, Edward knew he had to institutionalize her for his own safety, but given the cruelty of asylums in those days, he couldn’t bear to leave her in such a place. Instead he confined her to the attic of Thornfield, with her serving-woman Grace to keep an eye on her. Grace sometimes overdrank to deal with the stress, and when she lay snoring and saturated in alcohol Bertha would sneak out to terrorize the house. Hence the bloody attempt on Mason’s life, hence the fire in Rochester’s room. Horrified and heartbroken, Jane knows she has to leave immediately, before the scandal spreads throughout the countryside. Rochester waylays her that evening, telling the whole story, and he earns back her sympathy. But he also begs her to run to France with him and be his mistress, his one-and-only, his wife in everything but official word and deed. Jane knows she’ll never respect herself if she gives in, so she packs her meager belongings and runs that night, onto the moors, and doesn’t stop running until she literally falls down from exhaustion. And then she gets up and keeps running.After several days of running she makes it to a village where a kindly young vicar and his two sisters take her in: St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers. They offer Jane a job as a teacher at their little schoolhouse, and she gladly accepts. Things continue smoothly here for several months.Eventually, St. John proposes marriage to Jane. He’s madly in love with another young lady, but he feels that Jane is better suited as a missionary’s wife, since St. John believes God is telling him to sail to India and preach there. Jane knows she can’t accept and refuses. Soon after she leaves the Rivers’ house, since things there have grown awkward. She has a quasi-spiritual experience wherein she hears Rochester crying out for her, as if he needs help, and she strikes back out for Thornfield. She finds the place a charred ruin. In the village nearby she hears that Bertha successfully set the whole house on fire. Edward made sure all the servants were safe, and tried to get Bertha out too, but she resisted him and leapt from the roof to her death. Edward survived, but lost his eyesight and his right hand. It is this Edward Rochester whom Jane now meets, a broken and humbled man who realizes that he drove her away by lying to her and demanding that she live on terms she found morally abhorrent. She forgives him, and he’s overjoyed to have her back.Reader, she marries him. As of the epilogue, ten years after the last chapter, they have at least one child, and Edward has dimly regained his sight. (hide spoiler)]This book deserves its exalted status. The term “strong heroine” has become cliché and meaningless, so let me say that Jane is an exceptionally strong, brave, disciplined, noble character who happens to be female. Her moral fortitude is unequalled. Even Dorothea Brooke isn’t quite this resolute. And I’d like to see any of today’s hyped heroines *cough* Celaena from Throne of Glass *cough* endure what Jane endures. Brontë’s grasp of mythology and Scripture add immeasurable depth to the book. Some figures, such as Esther and Danaë, are directly referenced, others are implied. In many ways, this story fits the pattern of Hades and Persephone. Rochester is perhaps twenty years older than Jane, and lives in a gloomy place, (view spoiler)[a living grave for Bertha and a reminder of the deep past for everyone else. Also like Hades, Rochester was tricked into his present situation (ruling the Underworld, marrying Bertha) and then tricks his innocent young bride (giving Persephone the pomegranate, lying to Jane about not having a wife), not out of malice but out of selfish desperation not to lose her. Like Persephone, Jane is able to forgive him and eventually return to him, drawn back by some mystical, inexorable force. (hide spoiler)]Curiously, this book which is both very old and blatantly Christian gives the Persephone figure much more say over her own fate than many of the versions that come later—for instance, Christine in The Phantom of the Opera is just as virtuous as Jane but struggles to stand up for herself. The “modern” heroines have it the worst: Sarah in Labyrinth is probably going to really regret eating that peach; Rey in Star Wars is so mentally and spiritually bound to the man she fled from that he will always be able to find her. Indeed, Jane is no bird, and no net ensnares her.Just read this book because it is just as wonderful as everyone says it is. The 2011 movie starring Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska is well worth your time.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
7381738	It’s a steamy night here in the Knowsley Working Men’s Club, in Knowsley, Manchester. For tonight’s bout only, the organisers have waived their No Women policy but many slightly deranged working class men (it’s the lead in their bloodstream) are muttering darkly, and lightly too, and expectorating heavily against the walls (it’s the coal dust in their lungs). The promoter Manny Rayner clambers heavily into the ring.“Thang yew, thang yew, lads, this next fight is an elimination bout, three falls, one submission or death to decide the winner. In the BLUE corner, we have the mild mannered yet steely protofeminist from Thornton, Yorkshire, Miss Jane....EEEEEYYYYRRRREEEEE….”Scattered indifferent applause. Jane, clad in full length governess attire but with ridiculous bright red boxing gloves tied to each hand, storms to the side of the ring and shouts a torrent of abuse at the assembled grinders, mashers and collier lads. They tell her to fuck off. She tells them to fuck off. They don't fuck off and neither does she.“Thang yew, thang yew, and in the RED corner we have…. The Man from La Mancha himself, DON…. QUIXOTE ... ‘ere, where the fuck is he?”There’s no one at all in the red corner. Jane capers to the middle of the ring mouthing obscenities and shadow boxing madly. She grabs the microphone from Manny.“The man from la ManchaIs a bit of a wankerE –I-O, E-I-O”“Give us the fuck that back” says Manny, and seizes back the mike. Just then a galloping sound begins to emerge from outside the doors of the club. A couple of grinders open the doors, peer outside, then flatten themselves against the wall. Don Quixote is riding towards the club on his trusty horse LADY GAGA dressed in full armour, with a lance and all that medieval gubbins. He can’t stop. He comes belting in through the door and LADY GAGA, seeing a boxing ring right in the way, comes to a screeching halt. The Don goes flying. Up up up, then down down down, smack bang onto the centre of the boxing ring and through it with a great crash. Manny and a couple of collier lads peer down into hole. Manny takes up the mike again.“Thang yew gentlemen, tonight’s elimination celebrity death match has been won by a technical knockout, tonight’s champion is… put your hands together… Miss Jane Eyre…!”Cries of “Who the fuck cares”. Jane strides about bigging herself up and gobbing down into the hole where the dead Quixote lies in his mangled gore. She’s off her head now. “I told you but you weren’t listening - well, who’s the governess now? Eh? Eh? No, YOU fuck off! I AM THE GOVERNESSATOR! Yeah, me, not you, loser!”Later Jane writes in her journal.Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experiences past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: a boxing match, nay a celebrity death match. It was humiliating, true. It was not a noble occupation. The persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character would have drawn lamentable conclusions. And as to the outcome, where it was not sinister and cruel it was piffling. Let me condense now. I am sick of the subject. I know not when I shall have to fight again.
1721667348	Book Review 3+ out of 5 stars to Jane Eyre, a wonderful novel written in 1847 by Charlotte Brontë. I read this book on Spring break just prior to my 21st birthday, perhaps not the best time to take this beauty on. At 21, being a guy, and English major and forced to read a few books I didn't think I'd like, this came at a time where although I liked it, I wasn't as in love with as most others are... hence the 3+ rating. I believe if I read it today, it'd be a 4+. But I have 1200 books on my TBR and simply can't afford to take on any re-reads without losing my mind. Perhaps I should watch a TV or Film version to renew my interest? It has all the right parts... young woman suffering at the hands of the conventions of time and family (two things I enjoy in books)... the love of a 'good' man (meaning you see a relationship grow high and low)... and drama (will she escape it all?). Society was harsh nearly 200 years ago. I would not have survived. I am not vocal about my opinions of people's behavior or societal limitations, but I believe anyone should be able to do anything they want without hurting someone else or the world we live in. If you want to marry your cousin, go ahead... not my business. If you want to sleep with a new man or woman every night, more power to you. Doesn't affect me. If you want to wear revealing clothing... go look your best -- just don't do it where someone may cause an accident as a result! :) Point being.... I struggle sometimes with books that cover these conventions because I want everything to be free and open. And when it isn't, I can enjoy the battle to get there, but it's a bit difficult when I combine it with 200 year old setting and guides. That said... I adore Jane. I empathize with her. I could be her on some levels. The words and language are great. It should be read. But know what you're getting into! About Me For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
