83571351	Don't you kind of hate how we've entered the decadent phase of Goodreads wherein perhaps fifty percent (or more) of the reviews written by non-teenagers and non-romancers are now naked and unabashed in their variously effective attempts at being arch, wry, meta, parodic, confessional, and/or snarky? Don't you kind of pine (secretly, in the marrow of your gut's merry druthers) for the good ol' days of Goodreads (known then as GodFearingGoodlyReading.com) when all reviews were uniformly plainspoken, merely utilitarian, unpretentious, and -- above all else -- dull, dull, dull? Don't you kind of hate when people say 'don't you think this way or feel that way' in an effort to goad you both psychologically and grammatically into agreeing with them?In the words of ABBA: I do, I do, I do(, I do, I do).Well, because the interwebs is a world in which the past stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the present (and with fetish porn), we can revisit the past in its inviolable presentness any time we wish. Or at least until this website finally tanks.Consider (won't you?) Matt Nieberle's review of Macbeth in its entirety. I have bound it with a heavy rope and dragged it here for your perusal. (Please understand that many a sic are implied in the following reviews.)its really complicated and stupid!why cant we be reading like Romeo and Juliet?!?!at least that book is good!There you have it. Refreshingly, not a review written in one of the witch's voices or alluding to Hillary and Bill Clinton or discussing the reviewer's first period. Just a primal yell unleashed into the dark wilderness of the cosmos. Yes, Mr. Nieberle is (probably) a teenager, but I admire his ability to strongarm the temptation to be clever or ironic. (Don't you?) He speaks the native language of the idk generation with an economy and a clarity that renders his convictions all the more emphatic. Here's MICHAEL's review of the same play. You may 'know' MICHAEL; he is the 'Problems Architect' here at Goodreads. (A problematic title itself in that it implies that he designs problems... which might be the case, for all I know.)This book shouldn't be required reading... reading plays that you don't want to read is awful.Reading a play kinda sucks to begin with, if it was meant to be read, then it would be a novel, not a play. On top of that the teach had us students read the play aloud (on person for each character for a couple pages). None of us had read the play before. None of us wanted to read it (I made the mistake of taking the 'easy' english class for 6 years). The teacher picked students that looked like they weren't paying attention. All of this compounded to make me pretty much hate reading classics for something like 10 years (granted macbeth alone wasn't the problem).I also hate iambic pentameter.Pure activism there. STOP the mandatory reading of plays. It's wrong, morally and academically. Plus it can really fuck up your GPA. There's no wasteful extravagance in this editorial... no fanfare, no fireworks, no linked photos of half-naked, oiled-up, big-bosomed starlets, no invented dialogues between the author and the review-writer. It's simple and memorable. Being required to read plays is wrong, and if you require anyone, under duress, to read a play then you have sinned and are going to hell, if you believe in hell. If not, you're going to the DMV.I am also tired of all you smug spelling snobs. You damnable fascists with your new-fangled dictionaries and your fancy-schmancy spell check. Sometimes the passionate immediacy of a message overcomes its spelling limitations. Also, in this age when we are taught to respect each other's differences, it seems offensively egocentric and mean-spirited to expect others to kowtow to your petty linguistic rules. Artistic expression will free itself no matter how you try to shackle it.That's your cue, Aubrey.In my personal opinion, the play Macbeth was the worste peice ever written by Shakespeare, and this is saying quite a bit considering i also read his Romeo and Juliet. Ontop of it's already unbelievable plot, unrealistic characters and absolutly discusting set of morals, Shakespeare openly portrays Lady Macbeth as the true vilian in the play. Considering she is mearly the voice in the back round and Macbeth himself is truely committing the hideous crimes, including murder and fraud, I do not see why it is so easy to assume that Macbeth would be willing to do good instead of evil if only his wife were more possitive. I believe that this play is uterally unrealistic.But the following is by far the ne plus ultra of classic book reviewing. While succinct and without any distracting inclination to coyness or cuteness, Jo's review alludes to a bitterness so profound that it is inexpressible. One imagines a few Signet Classic Editions hacked to bits with pruning shears in Jo's vicinity.I hate this play. So much so that I can't even give you any analogies or similes as to how much I despise it. An incrementally snarkier type might have said something like... 'I hate this play like a simile I can't come up with.' Not Jo. She speaks a raw, undecorated truth unfit for figurative language. And there's certainly nothing wrong with that. Once in a great while, when you get neck-deep in dandified pomo hijinks, it's a nice wallow in the hog pen you're itchin' for. Thank you, Jo. I love you and your futile grasping at similes that can't approach the bilious hatred in your heart. You are mine, and I am yours. Figuratively speaking, of course. And now here's my review:Macbeth by William Shakespeare is the greatest literary work in the English language, and anyone who disagrees is an asshole and a dumbhead.
214471428	This play always holds a place in my heart and the top spot of most embarassing moments in my life. To be fair it was probably my fault as I’d never heard the superstition about not calling the “Scottish play” by name, and since it was my role I’d been shouting Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth all day. In fifth grade we did a full production of this as our class play and I was honored to be cast as Macbeth (I went to a weird school). I still have many of my monologues memorized. Because memory loves embarrassing moments. And since embarrassing photographic evidence seems necessary, embarrassing photographic evidence is precisely what you shall receive: Get a load of this assholeAnyways, after months of rehersal the big day comes and they invite every 4th and 5th grade class to come watch along with all our parents and grandparents who wanted to be proud of me for a moment. When we get to the murder scene, the fake blood bottle exploded all over my hands and costume like I'd just murdered a whole army and not one little king. So picture very sensitive, 9 year old me in an oversized medieval cloak my mom made with blood just dripping off my hands like a waterfall as you can also see an equal amount of blood draining from my face because I am very much overthinking it. This play is getting dark and it's all going dark for me because somewhere mid-monolouge I both passed out and threw up allllllll over my fancy cloak (choose-your-own-adventure which came first).I'm sure other things happened that year but this pretty much occupies my entire headspace for 5th grade. Oh, and this play rules. I’m particularly fond of Kurosawa’s adaptation of it as Throne of Blood, because who amongst us doesn’t have a slight crush of Mifune and him and I have shared a role. Put that on my tombstone.In a way, one could view this play as the predictable fall-out from men having what is essentially a dick measuring contest and trying to be all most masculine man of the manor. Or castle. Whatever. But challenging ones “manhood” is the fuel to the fire throughout the play. Lady Macbeth just needs to question his masculinity in order to manipulate him, and Macbeth calls the masculinity of his murderers into question to provoke them into offing Banquo. ‘Dispute it like a man,’ Malcolm challenges, to which Macduff replies, ‘I shall do so. But I must also feel it as a man.’ There is a direct line drawn between the cruel violence and this unhinged necessity to ‘feel it as a man,’ and an entire kingdom hangs under the knife–it is also a reminder that being a king is about putting a kingdom first, the pull of proving ones masculinity centers insecurities of the self and tumbles into tyranny. Its a tale as old as time that still brings about political chaos when the flexing of oneself as a “strongman” throws everyone in a temper to prove they are “man enough” or whatever weird toxic notions they want to project. One might recall politicians in their own day who used the same notion around masculinity in place of a personality. It also shows the threat of ambition for power can have violent consequences if it is not kept in check. As usual, Shakespeare’s legacy lives on from the ways his themes seem to remain relevant hundreds of years later.
1182580	Macbeth is Shakespeare's darkest play not only because of the restricted palette of its images--shades of black varied with bright red blood--but also because, in the play's world of warfare and witchcraft, its hero is half-damned from the start. Inured to violence, prone to superstition, Macbeth struggles with the hags' predictions in the depth of his soul. But his wife, fiercely ambitious, never struggles. When he is haunted by his imagination, she is steadfast: preparing everything, looking after the details, urging him on. It is only afterward, when he is thoroughly damned, coldly vicious, that she finds she cannot wash Duncan's blood off from her hands.Among other things, this play is the portrait of a good marriage. If, that is, a good marriage can be made in hell.
347067144	highlights of this play include, but are not limited to:- the witches! they are the original halloween qweens. they are serving some major spooky realness. also, they went and haunted a woman just because she wouldnt share her hazelnuts. that is the exact level of petty that i aspire to be. - lady macbeth. honestly, everything she says (especially to her husband) is so savage. she doesnt want to be a queen, she wants to be the queen. and her first scene is iconic. “unsex me.” yaaassss. ditch those bonds of femininity. be the murderous biotch we all want you to be. - how someone born by a c-section is the key factor for determining the outcome of pretty much everything. soooo random. lol. - that the english army thought they could hide behind tree branches and sneak up on macbeth for a surprise attack. - the fact the macbeth believed it and actually thought it was the forest.- “what, you egg!?” is now my go-to insult.↠ 4.5 stars

1990953205	ولدت من جديد منذ عدة سنوات.كنت قد انقطعت عن القراءة تقريبا منذ التخرج فالعمل فالزواج و مشاغل الحياة و السفر و الربيع العربي بأخباره و همومه و مشاكله و انتكاساته و مذابحه ثم فجأة زهدت كل تلك الحياة و أحسست أن شيئا ما ينقصني. الروح لم تشبعها نشرات الأخبار و صفحات التواصل الاجتماعي و برامج التوك شو. عدت قديما بالذاكرة لمرحلة كان فيها الكتاب صديقي و رائحة الورق إدماني و السطور غايتي و مرساي و قررت في هذه المرة ألا تكون هناك حدود للمعرفة و لا قواعد للقراءة. سأقرأ كل شيء و في كل شيء و لأبدأ بما رفضته من قبل.أزعم أن عقلي تفتح عن ذي قبل بدرجة أنا راض عنها بصورة كبيرة و قرأت من الكتب المفيدة ما لم أكن لأعرف عنه شيئا و لو طال العمر و كان هذا الموقع الرائع الذي تعرفت به على أصدقاء لم أكن أتخيل وجودهم إلا في عالم مثالي من صنع القاريء وحده و صار لي فيه أخوة كثر و أخوات لم تلدهن أمي و لكن لكل شيء ضريبته.أسرتني القراءة فصارت شاغلي الأول بعد عائلتي و التهمت كل وقت فراغي بأكمله و من ثم ازداد وزني في تلك السنوات الأربعة بمقدار أربعة و عشرين كيلو جراما و فشلت كل محاولات زحزحتي من مكاني لأمارس أي رياضة بعيدا عن الكتاب.ما علاقة كل ذلك بشكسبير و مسرحيته؟ و لماذا أصدعكم يا أصدقائي بمشاكلي و حياتي و ذكرياتي؟هنا بيت القصيد. فهذا هو الكتاب الصوتي رقم عشرة خلال ابريل-2018ماذا يعني ذلك؟يعني أنني أقرأ بأذني لأول مرة في حياتي. أقرأ أثناء المشي كمن يمشي أثناء النوم و كأن القراءة حلم جميل يتحقق بدون مجهود يذكر مع الرياضة و بدون أن يأخذ أي منهما الوقت من الأخر فأحيانا أمشي أكثر لأنتهي من جزء معين من الكتاب فأنسى التعب و أحرق المزيد من الدهون التي راكمتها الكتب و الكسل.خسرت سبعة كيلوجرامات خلال شهر إبريل/نيسان و أتعشم في فقدان المزيد خلال الشهور القادمة بترشيحاتكم و اختياراتكم السحرية التي تفتح لي دائما عوالم من البهجة و المعرفة.أشكر عائلتي التي تتيح لي الوقت لممارسة عاداتي الشخصية المزعجة و تتحمل في ذلك كل مجهود و تذلل كل الصعاب كما أشكر أيضا صديقة القراءة الأخت العزيزة إسراء التي أوحت لي بقراءة الكتب المسموعة فساهمت دون أن تدري في تلك النتيجة و كانت سببا في حل المشكلة و الشكر موصول لكم أيها الأصدقاء لمن وصل إلى هذا السطر أو لم يصل فلكم مني جزيل الشكر و خالص الأمنيات بعالم مليء بالصحة و البهجة و المعرفة.أما مكبث، فهي تستحق حديثًا آخر. لكنني مدين لها بهذا التحول كله.مدين لصوت شكسبير وهو يهمس في أذني: "الحياة ليست إلا ظلّاً يمشي، ممثّل مسكين يتبختر ساعته على المسرح، ثم لا يُسمع له صوت." وأنا... وجدت صوتي أخيرًا.
1322977959	this is probably my favorite shakespeare. witches. ladies doing murder. prophecies. what's not to love? beyond that there's the witty writing and clever wordplay and sex puns we all know and love from billy shakes.this passes that with flying colors. i also am super glad i read this for a class, because even though i love reading shakespeare of my own accord because it corroborates the fact that i am an Intellectual and an Academic and a Quiet Genius, there's just something about analyzing it with 18 other people (5 of whom actually read it and care) that hits different.maybe i'll reread this knowing my presumably brilliant annotations await.this is part of a project i'm doing where i put myself into the twisted mind of 17 year old me and review books i read then. it's a blast, both of the "from the past" and "so fun" variety.
142781969	There are two reasons to love this play.The first reason is Lady Macbeth. Man, that girl has got it goin’ on. Have you ever found yourself in the running for, say, a new position that’s opened up at your company, a position for which you—along with one of your equally worthy colleagues, perhaps—might qualify? You may not have given much thought to your professional advancement before, but now that this promotion has been dangled before you, it has ignited a spark of ambitious desire. Imagine the possibilities! And it is just within your grasp...if only there were a way to edge out the competition. Maybe you could sabotage a project he’s working on. Or you could discredit him by rumoring of his incompetence. Better yet, you could off him in the parking garage. But each of these strategies requires a certain level of gumption to execute, a level not everyone possesses. This is where it pays to be married to Lady Macbeth. All she would need is a mere mention of this potential uptick in your career path and she’s off and running, drafting the schematics, telling you where to stand (just outside the stairwell, across from his car, within easy reach of the tire iron lying in the corner that can be used while he’s distractedly sifting through his keys). Why doesn’t she do it herself, you ask? Well, why should she? It’s not her job. Her job is to support you, to boost your confidence, to supply that additional gumption. You’re the one who has to do the dirty work.Lady Macbeth is an amazing character. I’ve seen reviews on here that criticize her for being the morally reprehensible of the two protagonists, planting ideas in her husband’s head that he would not have otherwise formed, encouraging him toward evil deeds that he would not have otherwise committed. I disagree. She may have made a mistake helping to plan Duncan’s murder, but if anything Lady Macbeth is the one with her moral faculties still intact—she exhibits a profound sense of remorse at the end of the play that Macbeth recognizes as nothing short of an ailment for which to seek a cure. While Macbeth is off slaughtering anyone who might threaten his regal standing, his wife is at home rubbing the fuck out of her hands until the blisters explode and she suffocates in a pool of her own pus.The second reason to love this play is the eloquence of the language. There are passages in this play that describe human emotion so briefly yet so profoundly it triggers goosebumps. These are some of my favorites: On expressing one’s grief: What, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows;Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speakWhispers the o’er-fraught heart and bids it break. On not having enough gumption: Yet do I fear thy nature;It is too full o’ the milk of human kindnessTo catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;Art not without ambition, but withoutThe illness should attend it. On contemplating ambition’s worth: Nought’s had, all’s spent,Where our desire is got without content:’Tis safer to be that which we destroyThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. On being past the point of no return: All causes shall give way: I am in bloodStepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,Returning were as tedious as go o’er. On the futility of life: Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stageAnd then is heard no more: it is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing. On the finality of death: There’s nothing serious in mortality:All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;The wine of life is drawn, and the mere leesIs left this vault to brag of. I said in the comments section of my Hamlet review that I was preferring Hamlet to Macbeth. While I think I prefer the character of Hamlet to that of Macbeth, I no longer stand by that statement in terms of the play itself. Macbeth really is a masterpiece.

134285209	Still my favourite Shakespeare play? I think so.Language-wise, Shakespeare is always a master. He invented many a word and phrase that we all use even today, centuries later. But some of the stories and characters are better than others. Macbeth, in my opinion, sits near the top of the pile. The witches and their fateful prophecies, the bloody betrayals, the madness of Lady Macbeth, and the tragedy of Macbeth himself. Bringing about his own prophesised downfall, step by step. Nothing short of genius.
1742119417	Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scornThe power of man, for none of woman bornShall harm Macbeth.Poor old Macbeth. You were doomed from the very first act. Your mistake was believing in hearsay, prophecy and half-truths. You were an excellent Thane, noble and strong. But you were never meant to be King. You should never have told your wife about the witches, that way the fires of your ambition would never have been fanned. You only committed in halves to the witches advice. You needed to go the full way or not at all. For you are bloody. Your butcher’s work in King Duncan’s tent saw to that. Your soldier’s work on the battlefield also saw to that. You weren’t afraid to get your hands dirty and in this you were bold and daring, but none would ever call one such as you resolute. Your conscience got the better of you, it made you weak and vulnerable, and because of this you failed. Your rule failed. Your sword arm failed. You needed to go the full way or not at all. Desperation, paranoia and butchery are what followed your indecisiveness. You killed those that could have been loyal; you killed those that could have remained friends. And it was your doom. You created your own haunting, your own end. You listened to the advice of the witches when you should have followed your own path, your own mind. Their words killed you. Your faith in them killed you. Macduff was defeated at your feet, but your fear conquered you. Their words unmanned you. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff.Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
222629537	The play starts with the standard three witches, (which Shakespeare practically invented) plotting the assassination of Duncan. Why the King of Scotland is to be killed is never explained, the weird sisters (an appropriate name ) maybe they just like to cause evil, such a brilliant scene to see and absorb. Their tool is Macbeth , a lord and very ambitious man, married to an even more woman, Scotland in the mid 11th century is barbaric, bloody and with the greedy nobles perpetually fighting for the throne, the sword rules here. The English and Norsemen outsiders also battle for influence in that rough land , the tumultuous conflicts always ready to appear, death comes not infrequently. A great opportunity occurs when the king is to visit Macbeth's castle, in order to thank him for defeating the rebel Macdonwald. The Lady Macbeth urges her husband to kill the trusting Duncan , a weak ruler and seize the throne from his cousin. She implies that Macbeth is not a man and cowardly if he doesn't eliminate Duncan; hesitating his mind in turmoil can he kill his own kin, already a very important man, treachery wins ... deciding he wants the glory of the title, power is a magnet for the rogue . After the bloody deed is done, Macbeth is almost reluctant to slaughter more and more of his perceived enemies...Including the noble Macduff's whole family (Macduff had fled south of the border), there are an endless supply of opponents. But the former monarch's sons had escaped, Malcolm the eldest to England, Donalbain the youngest to Ireland, they can never forget... revenge will be so sweet. The deteriorating Lady Macbeth begins to sleepwalk, trying to wash the imaginary blood off her hands, when observed by her husband and doctor she says "Out, damned spot, out I say," a sad sight to behold for the new king, the strong woman evaporates, his circle of friends diminish as loneliness prevails. The tide turns a storm is brewing, forces are gathering in that troubled kingdom, Malcolm and Macduff, with the help of 10,000 English soldiers are coming. Macbeth is confident that he cannot be killed, the witches have promised him, would they lie? One of the greatest plays ever performed on any stage, Shakespeare at the top of his abilities contributes to the world of illusion.
5041178353	Me ha encantado el tono brujeril, Lady Macbeth como la voz tentadora y que termina de empujar a un hombre hambriento por su ambición hasta lo más hondo de la tortura mental de sus acciones. Y sí, también la muy manida lucha entre el bien y el mal, los monólogos y las conversaciones sobre la moralidad, el honor y la lealtad.Después de haber leído dos veces Romeo y Julieta me la vivía odiando profundamente la idea de tener que leer algo más de Shakespeare porque pensaba que me encontraría con otra lectura así de cursi, ridícula y extremada e innecesariamente trágica para mi gusto. Una vez más compruebo que está bien dejar a un lado los caprichos y madurar, porque esto me ha gustado más y me ha parecido una toma de contacto más creíble y coherente con los personajes.Macbeth utiliza como motor de arranque la profecía de tres brujas que dicen que nuestro querido protagonista va a ser coronado como rey en un futuro cercano. Inmediatamente esto será para Macbeth motivo y razón suficiente para sumergirse de cabeza en una espiral caótica llena de ambición y deseo de obtener a toda costa el poder que le fue prometido. Lo que pasa es que aquello que se toma por la fuerza y en medio de traiciones y asesinatos no puede durar para siempre. La deslealtad y lo inmoralidad es castigada y las piezas más pronto que tarde empiezan a caer para hacer pagar a un hombre que a pesar de sentirse atormentado y culpable todo el tiempo no deja de aferrarse al poder a toda costa hasta el punto mismo de perder su humanidad.

865164339	I recently attended the Royal Shakespeare Company’s performance of Macbeth at the Barbican Centre (London, 2019, directed by Polly Findlay). In this interpretation of the play, Macbeth and the men around him are modern infantrymen. The staging does not point explicitly to a situation on which Shakespeare could shed some light — although current and unsettling examples would have been easy to pick. We are in Hell itself. The Weird Sisters are played by very young girls, who strangely resemble the twin girls in Kubrick’s Shining, just as Banquo’s ghost, soaked in blood, reminds us of De Palma’s Carrie. Macbeth’s progression, from zealous liegeman to killing machine and finally to cornered nihilist is manifest; as well as that of his alluring wife, from blind ambition to denial and fatal hysteria.However, the most striking aspect of this stageplay — and, broadly speaking, of Shakespeare’s masterpiece — is not only the fact that it is all centred on the villain, the monster. It is, above all, the inescapable machinery of death that is set into motion from the very start (the witches’ self-fulfilling prophecy), and especially from the moment when Macbeth stabs Duncan to eternal sleep. From this moment on, there is no turning back, and at this precise moment, the hungover Porter, sole comic relief and dispassionate observer of the whole tragedy, sets a huge clock ticking down, that will reach zero exactly when Macduff slits Macbeth’s throat. Here, as in other dramas indeed, the initial prediction is inescapable, whether the heroes try to change their fate (think about Laius’ failed attempt in Oedipus Rex), or whether they struggle to make it happen against all the odds and bloodbaths, as is the case in this “Scottish Play”.Moreover and to top it all off, at the end of this RSC performance, when Malcolm is crowned, and justice seems to be restored, the three witches make one last appearance, revealing that Fleance, Banquo’s son, might very soon use another dagger against his sovereign. The clock, tick-tick or knock-knock, is ready to be triggered into horror again. Here, Time has never been less “out of joint”. It is, on the contrary, set for another deadly loop — again, a Kubrickian trait. “To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow” (V,5,19). Disturbing and mind-blowing.
1428305395	3.5 starsSo I listened to the Playaway audio version, and it was good! Instead of someone reading the story, this one has a whole cast reading it like a play. There's even sound effects!{insert booming thunder}I know, right?!So, yeah, that was very cool!Now, as far as the actual play goes? Eh. It was ok.Wait, wait, wait! Before you tell me I'm an idiot (debatable), and that this was the best thing since sliced cheese, let me remind you that I was listening to this sucker, so it's not like I could study the words for a few seconds or anything. People with accents were speaking in some sort of Ye Olde Englishith, and some of it got lost in translation for me.Plus, I'm used to reading mostly comic books, so my brain wandered off a few times while I was listening to this. <---This will become a very important thing to remember later in this review.shrugsHere's what I got out of it:Witches! Witches everywhere!Yeah, random witches did this singsong thing, and rambled on for a bit about things that I couldn't quite make out. I'm going to assume they made predictions, and I'm going to assume the predictions were important.Double, double, toil and trouble...plus some other stuff.Evil queen alert!Yep. Some poor dude is about to get done in by his wife.Bet he's wishing he'd remembered their anniversary about right now...Apparently, she's having an affair with Macbeth, and talks him into killing her hubby, King Whatshisname? Doesn't matter, he's dead pretty much right off the bat.Right away, Macbeth becomes king, and (I guess) inherits Lady Whatshername Macbeth. All is going according to plan!Edit: Hey, guess what?! None of that affair stuff happened! Yeah, it seems as though I totally misinterpreted all of it. Shocking that I could do something like that! (view spoiler)[Look, you guys could at least PRETEND to be shocked. I'm not asking for much, here, am I? Just a little bit of support as I try to become better read, more well-rounded, and expand my horizons. So, you know, GASP! or something, goddamnit! (hide spoiler)]Guess Lady Macbeth was just a power-hungry twat that talked her henpecked hubby into stabbing his buddy in his sleep.Still, I think my version is cooler, and William should think about writing my idea into this play, you know?Now, here's where the plot got (more) murky for me.I guess Mr. Macbeth started killing off Olde King Whatshisname's supporters, and made himself some enemies.Plus, Lady M starts to lose her mind just a tad, and starts wandering around at night scrubbing imaginary blood off of her hands.Out, damned spot!Is it guilt? OCD? Or just the lack of a good pre-soak agent?Time to get more good advice from the witches!Bubble, bubble, you're in trouble...plus other stuff.Lady BigMac loses it completely, offs herself, and leaves Macbeth to deal with the consequences on his own. What a bitch, right?!But that's ok, because he doesn't seem to spend much time mourning her. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow... Whatever. She's dead, and these other dudes out there are pissed because he killed off their families, and besmirched their good names.You tell 'em I'm coming... and hell's coming with me, you hear?... Hell's coming with me!But Macbeth ain't skeered, see? 'Cause he's got this prophecy that the witches gave him, tucked into his back pocket.No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.So, I was thinking, Ooooh! Hey, I'll bet that means some chick is gonna stab his ass!, but I was wrong. The twist was waaaay better.Emergency C-Section, for the win!

1773678989	What else can be said about Macbeth. An infinite amount of movies and theatre productions have been made of this most tragic of tragedies, most horrific of horror stories - complete with witches and murder. Lady Macbeth is one of literature's ultimate evil women and she can never manage to wash the blood off her hands - such a fantastic psychological illustration of guilt has never been surpassed until perhaps Raskolnikov's dialogs with Sonya in Crime and Punishment. A must-read and one of the greatest Shakespeare plays among so many titanic, staggering works.The book begins with the three "weird sisters" who anticipate Macbeth's arrival. We then switch to Macbeth with his companions after a bloody, successful battle and see the ill-fated Banquo before, in the next scene, the two of them fall upon the weird sisters on the "blasted heath" and their fatal predictions are made as to the rise of Macbeth. Banquo is barely affected other than the strangeness of the scene, but Macbeth is truly inspired. Critics have for centuries asked whether, without the weird sisters, Macbeth would have been capable of all the murders that will soon begin. I feel that he already a smoldering piece of evil inside him (like that in the toaster at the end of 'The Time Bandits') and that the weird sisters as well as Lady Macbeth gave him the final push towards action, without which it is possible that he would have remained a sort of evil reflection of Hamlet.It never ceases to amaze me the power of the writing and the deep psychology of Macbeth and his deadly Lady. Blind and bloody ambition. Are they avenging the world for her barren womb? How close does Richard III come to Macbeth’s depravity? The two stories are quite similar, but Macbeth is a bigger, grander character.

5696918073	They're no Bonnie and Clyde but the Macbeths are something. Swap daggers for machine guns and you've got the gist. Yet, in Shakespeare's hands, the action is minimal. A murder. Some more. All are done off stage. The real matter is what goes on inside the murderers' heads. As a play, it shouldn't work. But it does. Here is how:First, we're reminded that we are minds. Not only with thought, but also conscience and other things that can unravel, tighten, and knot. Second, it raises the question "Where does evil come from?" Is ambition its mother or loyalty that is misplaced? Finally, it warns how lovers can become victims of one another and woe betide if you get in their path.If you haven't already, give it a read. Was the last time in school? Grab it again. There's more here than most teachers dare cover in classes. Read it. Then, ask your own questions.
401941602	8/25/23: Rereading with a class I am teaching with a focus on ghosts/liminal space. And also witches, which are kind of related entities. And apparitions, visions, smoke and fog and filthy air. And another kind of liminal space of sorts: Madness, a kind of alternative way f experiencing the world involving hallucinations (such as Lady Macbeth's handwashing of "blood" we never see). You don't believe in ghosts? You may also not believe in witchcraft or witches. Well even the most hardened rationalist believe that hallucinations happen. And dreams. Are the witches even there? In Kurosawa's version of Macbeth, Throne of Blood, the witches appear to be ghosts, and the Lady Macbeth stand-in seems increasingly to become one. The chief ghost in Macbeth is Banquo, and that ghost becomes an instrument of guilt. Macbeth, out of control, fears his friend's ascent to the throne instead of him, foretold by the witches. But the ghost comes back to haunt him. But I was just talking to a friend about this ghost theme and he eagerly opened his computer to show me the opening of the Michael Fassbender filmed version of the play, which opens with a funeral: The death of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's child, a daughter. The theory in this adaptation is that Macbeth/LM may be driven, not primarily by ambition, or greed, but by grief! "I have given suck. . ." LM says to Macbeth, and she makes other references to a child, so we know there was one, ignored by critics, largely? And me? So it's an interesting theory, one of many, about what drives the action (okay, violent murders). I saw the film last night and was very moved by it. It's violent, but there's some ambivalence about it from Macbeth I hadn't seen before in any production. As he at battle, he sees and is dismayed by the death of so many young men. This is a grim interpretation of the (grim) play, but I have never seen so many kids highlighted in a production. At Duncan's party, a girl choir; at the killing of MacDuff's family (which historically takes place off stage), Macbeth, the grieving father, kills children, and in this production, Lady Macbeth more than hears about it: She is there, watching the slaughter, pushing the grieving mother off the edge into madness.So we see reasons for the mental and moral decline of the Macbeths. Even the final swordfight to the death between Macbeth and MaCduff seems close to being suicidal for Macbeth. And I like the appearance of Fleance at the end, watching Macbeth die and taking his sword (Fleance, Banquo's son--who watched Macbeth kill his father in this version--was prophesied to be one day King).So the usual interpretations highlight one of the usual motivations for the tragedy: Macbeth is ambitious and even ruthless for power; Lady Macbeth is a crazed madwoman who crazily pushes him to do what they both know is wrong; the witches manipulate the Macbeths to do all the killing. But in this one it is grief that is the driver. It's a new and exciting interpretation, which made me (more, not wholly) sympathetic to the grieving parents. It's not an excuse, but it's an explanation.And this is the foggiest, smokiest version of the play I have ever seen. I loved it."Double, double, toil and trouble"--those pesky witches3/26/19 update: In preparing to see a production of Macbeth as a chaperone on a class trip with my eighth grader, I dug out lots of materials to help him understand what is going on. Macbeth is my favorite Shakespeare, I have taught it many times, seen it many times; in other words, this is a recipe for disaster for my poor son, who might justifiably fear professorial pontification at every page he turns. To work against this tendency (in me) I just dug up guides to the play, such as MacBeth: For Kids (Shakespeare Can Be Fun series), Nina Packer's Tales from Shakespeare, a few dvd adaptations of the play, and oh, yeah, the play itself. And just left them casually strewn around the house, you know, IF you’re interested. . .Luckily he is a very good reader, has seen a lot of plays performed, and was independently interested in the play without me breathing down his neck: “Oh, you know, I saw a Stratford [Ontario] production in 1979 with Macbeth AS one of the three murderers!” “In this Australian film version, the witches do drugs with Macbeth, obscuring his judgment!” and so on. . . which could, I know, have led to “Da-aaad!” The Chicago Shakespeare production was great, one of the yearly productions they do, done in fewer than 90 minutes with the witches at the opening dancing a kind of medieval hip hop, with strobe lights and surround sound, and a bloody (nearly headless) Banquo. My son loved it, and so did his classmates. And so did I, proud to see his first Macbeth with him (he’s seen one other Shakespeare play so far). Original review, updated periodically:Probably most works of literature can be read again and again to both recapture that experience you had when first reading it and become something new, given your changed life circumstances, theoretical and other reading you are doing, and so on. The basic English teacher's writing prompt about this great play is "who is responsible for the tragedy of Macbeth?" It fits the current call for making arguments in school, too. Yet the play is not just a summary of arguments you might make. It's a living, breathing entity. But this question of whodunnit is still an interesting question, because it causes you to make commitments about beliefs and what it is the play has to say about the world. This time around, I am interested in the insights the play provides about the nature of “madness”: Psychological instability, paranormal phenomena, altered states of consciousness, dream life, the foul/fair confusion of good and evil. I have kids with variously different minds: one with autism, one possibly with schizophrenia, one who would appear to possess psychic faculties, two have night terrors, go sleepwalking, strange phenomena that might have got you put in a dungeon for madness a few centuries ago. I’m interested in this play in part for personal reasons. As well as its being just damned good theater.Shakespeare wrote the witches that open the play into the story he borrowed from Holinshed's Chronicles in part to honor (in exchange for his patronage from) King James, who had written a popular scholarly study of witchcraft, so the play purports to take witches and the darker side of the spiritual realm seriously. To contemporary, sophisticated audiences, the three weird sisters seem to be there for entertainment purposes, mainly, yet they also seem to know stuff—have paranormal knowledge—about what is going to happen to Macbeth and Banquo's son Fleance (who preceded James on the throne), so something is going on we have to either acknowledge or dismiss as fantasy. But, as I find out from my working class students, almost every one of them seems to have someone in the family that believes in or is actively involved in some way in psychic phenomena such as the prescience Shakespeare's witches seem to possess, sometimes in conjunction with their beliefs in more conventional religion. In other words, some who are religious also have experience with extra-religious ideation. But Macbeth is more than witches, when we think of challenges to conventional thinking: Macbeth, which mostly takes place in the dark, is one of four Shakespeare’s plays that features ghosts, and has both Lady Macbeth and Macbeth envisioning daggers and bloody hands and other things. What’s the relationship between the dark spiritual realm, psychic phenomena and "madness"? Lady Macbeth seems to drive her hubby to kill Duncan, and yet then seems to disintegrate, seeing blood on her hands, unable to get that damned spot out. And Macbeth sees the ghost of his murdered friend Banquo (because who had him murdered?). Do the witches make that happen, these ghostly images? Are they guilt-induced hallucinations? All these questions interest you more than a mere whodunnit. Fait is foul and foul is fair! The world is turned upside down!How do we limit the world when we limit our view of it to our (flawed) sense perceptions and rational deliberation? There are plenty of extra-sensory issues in the play to consider. The porter is drunk, and alters his perception through it. No one is sure what is happening because of the skewed relationship between appearance and reality. Stormy weather. . . Macbeth has murdered sleep, and sleep loss itself creates hallucinations. Visions abound. This is a dark and richly strange play in one sense about the madness of misplaced ambitions, ambitions possibly influenced by witches and/or a turn from good to “evil.” My college Thespians put on a production in 1973 that featured a Macbeth that seemed to resemble “Tricky Dick,” Richard Nixon. A recent production here in Chicago featured Macbeth as Donald Trump with the witches as strippers he consults as life coaches. Rude? Funny? Macbeth is a canvas on which many theatrical productions have been painted.

Then, bam!, and this arrives on my reading stack and proves to me that people have always been fucked up in their respective heads. Thanks a freaking lot! And here I was building my dreamcastle and getting ready to wear some rose glasses! This is not about a good marriage. This is about how some people can instigate each other to do weird shit (to put it extremely mildly!). Basically, if you take these two particular people going their separate ways, they might live well enough to not do too much damage to the world. But you connect them, in marriage or friendship or otherwise, and you get a boiling mix of complexes that even psychotherapy (had it even been available at that point in history, which it wasn't!) would have been hard pressed to resolve. The bottomline is: some people have synergistic effects when together, and some of those are designed by hell's blueprints.It's beautiful and all. But not everyone is likely to see all (or even most!) of the things expressed in this play. So, 4 stars. It's profound and I love the 'double trouble' thing (cheers, Mr. Potter!) but still way too somber.Q:Witch:When shall we three meet againIn thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Come, you spiritsThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,And fill me from the crown to the toe top-fullOf direst cruelty.

Come, thick night,And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,To cry, ‘Hold, hold!’" Lady Macbeth feels that her natural womanhood may keep her from acting cruelly, so she demands that they be removed. "Out, damned spot; out, I say. One, two, -- why, then ‘tis time to do’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? – Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.">/i> And then she says this at the end before we know that she had- (view spoiler)[committed suicide.

258122067	Book Review Ah Macbeth... good old, dark and devious Macbeth. We read this as part of a 10th grade AP English course and watched a movie to compare the differences between the two versions. Everyone has his or her own take on Macbeth. I rather enjoyed the play back in high school and then again in college during my English major. It's nearly 500 years old. Even by today's standards, it has some of the most fun drama you could imagine. It's sort of like a reality TV show, don't you think?Witches. Devious wife. Devilish husband. Death all around. Ghosts. Superstitious behavior. All great plot points. Amazing characters to work with. Fun and lyrical language. Can't say enough good things about it. But to flip the coin for a minute... was it too much all in one story? What are we supposed to learn from it? Who was this really about? Many open-ended questions I'd love to ask Mr. Shakespeare.If you've never read it... it's necessary reading for classic / historical literature. If you've read it and didn't like it, why? I'd love to know.For me, it hit the mystery sweet spot in a few ways, even though it wasn't quite a story about "who's the killer." It was more a thriller... "who else is gonna die?"Tons of adaptions. Stage plays. It's a multi-media dream come true for directors, producers and actors. As a play, it's easy to follow and moves quickly. About Me For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

3235962444	“As long as greed is stronger than compassion, there will always be suffering” These words spoken are some that should be remembered. Yes there are two sides to an argument which may ensure after putting such a quote out there but I rather look upon than that of comparison of this quote with the book. My opinion is that this quote really does resonate with the whole meaning of the book. It is quite wonderful how the comical and tragical plays of Shakespeare manages to give the readers a profound message at the end. It is something I always admired in classics. They are not written for the sake of it. There is something to be learnt from each. Even the smallest thing. In this case the suffering brought about my greed and the eternal pursuit of wanting something that would be of no reason of acquisition of yours. I shall not go on about this play as I am sure many before me has greatly discussed but I would like to part with the note that every reader should always make sure to come back once in a while to those that are called classics. There is something in each that would bring new meaning to our lives.

2083001947	Macbeth looms out of the grey cold Scottish mists – and like the witches who mark the downward steps along his path, he is a singularly forbidding figure. And those same grim qualities mark the William Shakespeare play that bears Macbeth’s name. It is a fast-moving and deeply troubling tragic drama, telling a story of royal ambitions achieved through violence and undone through the workings of fate, or human choice, or both. It was a story that spoke to the people of Shakespeare’s time; and it is a story that will continue to speak to audiences of the present and the future, as long as there are people in the world who will stop at nothing in their plans to gain or keep power.Shakespeare wrote Macbeth sometime after 1603 – a fateful year in English history. In that year, Queen Elizabeth I died, and her 45-year reign ended. She had presided over England’s “Golden Age,” a time in which a small and impoverished island kingdom became Europe’s wealthiest and most powerful country. Yet Elizabeth was, famously, England’s “Virgin Queen”; she never married, and had no children. The crown had to pass to someone – and so it was that King James VI of Scotland travelled south and became King James I of England. The Tudor dynasty ended, and the Stuart dynasty began – and people all over England developed an active interest in all things Scottish.It was a time of change in the life of playwright and actor William Shakespeare as well. His acting company had been the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, named for the royal official who gave them support and patronage; with Elizabeth’s death and James’s accession, his company became the King’s Men, with royal favour offering an enhanced budget for more lavish productions. In short, there were many reasons why Shakespeare might want to write a tragic play that would have a Scottish focus, and that would emphasize the legitimacy of the rule of the new Scottish-turned-English king.As the play begins, three witches in a stormy Scottish landscape chant that “Fair is foul, and foul is fair”, and anticipate that they will soon meet with the thane (or clan chief) Macbeth. When Macbeth makes his first appearance, two scenes later, his first words are, “So foul and fair a day I have not seen.” His words have a literal meaning – he has fought bravely and honourably in the armies of King Duncan of Scotland, and has played a leading role in the bloody defeat of the traitorous rebel Macdonwald, making the day “fair” in terms of the battle’s outcome and “foul” in terms of the amount of blood shed in the process. Yet Macbeth’s use of the words “foul” and “fair” links him with the witches, even before he has met them.Macbeth is with Banquo, with whom he has co-commanded Duncan’s loyalist army, when he encounters the witches and is hailed as Thane of Glamis (which he already is), and also as Thane of Cawdor and King of Scotland (neither of which he is yet). Banquo is meanwhile told that he will “get [beget] kings”, though he will never be one. Shortly afterward, Macbeth hears that the rebel Macdonwald’s erstwhile title of Thane of Cawdor has been taken from Macdonwald and bestowed upon Macbeth! With the fulfillment of the witches’ first prophecy, we see the wheels start to turn in Macbeth’s mind. He’s thinking about being king.And with that turn of events, the playgoer or reader enters a morally ambiguous universe where nothing is at it seems. Macdonwald rebelled against the legitimate authority of his king – something that the people of Shakespeare’s time knew was a capital offence. But when the time for his execution came, he faced death with courage and dignity; it is said of Macdonwald that “Nothing in his life/Became him like the leaving it.”At the same time, Lady Macbeth – in a time when it was expected that women would use their compassionate and empathetic natures to soften the harsh and warlike emotions of their husbands – turns out to be quite willing to use merciless violence to help her husband achieve the throne that has been promised him. She invokes the spirits of cruelty and violence, saying, “Come you spirits/That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here”, asking that the kindness of a woman’s nature be taken away from her long enough for her to see to the committing of an act of regicide. To Macbeth, she says, “Yet do I fear thy nature;/It is too full of the milk of human kindness”; she is challenging his masculinity, saying that a “real man” would kill the king and be done with it. King Duncan plans a friendly visit to Macbeth’s dominions, and Lady Macbeth urges her husband to “Look like the innocent flower,/But be the serpent under it.”For his part, Macbeth at first seems an unenthusiastic, almost passive-aggressive murderer, saying of his planned killing of Duncan that “If it were done, when ‘’tis done, then ‘’twere well/It were done quickly” -- Let’s get it over with, in other words. He feels as if he is but an instrument of fate, impelled to what, at some level, he knows he wants to do. “Is this a dagger which I see before me,/The handle toward my hand?” he asks. It is as though seeing this spectral vision of a floating dagger gives him the comforting illusion of not having any choice but to kill Duncan. It’s not my fault! The floating dagger made me do it!Once he has used deadly violence, Macbeth feels right away the psychological impact of what he has done; he laments that he no longer has access to the healing comforts of sleep, “Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care”. Hearing someone knocking at the door of his castle, he muses, with regret for what he has done, “Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou coulds’t.” Particularly powerful and moving are Macbeth’s reflections on the nature of guilt, as he meditates on the idea of trying to wash away the blood-guilt that he has incurred:Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this bloodClean from my hand? No, this my hand will ratherThe multitudinous seas incarnadine,Making the green one red.It is an arresting image – the blood-stained hand dyeing the entire ocean red with its crime – and it captures so well the way in which a guilty conscience can haunt a person.And one murder tends to lead on toward another. Lady Macbeth, sensing that their ill-gained throne is not safe, says, “Naught’s had, all’s spent,/Where our desire is got without content.” Macbeth, who likewise does not feel safe on his throne, says, “We have scotched the snake, not killed it”, and begins to plan the murder of Banquo – without telling his wife of his plans. That murder plan leads to a ghostly confrontation at a royal banquet – one of the most famous scenes in all of Shakespeare’s oeuvre.Shakespeare takes pains to emphasize that Macbeth’s bloody campaign for power brings him no peace. Thinking of the murdered King Duncan, Macbeth reflects, with some envy, that “Duncan is in his grave./After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.” For his own part, Macbeth states that “I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in/To saucy doubts and fears.” He knows that he will never know peace of mind, and he realizes that the path of bloodshed upon which he has set himself can only lead to further bloodshed and violence: “It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.” And as if to confirm his grim prophecy, Macbeth responds to the news that the Scottish nobleman Macduff has fled to England by planning the murders of Macduff’s entire family. This man who once courageously fought against battlefield enemies continues to descend in the moral scale – from murdering his anointed king, to murdering an old and trusted friend, to murdering innocent and helpless women and children. It is truly a Dantean and infernal progression.Anxious about his grip on the throne, Macbeth decides, “I’ll make assurance double sure,” and goes to see the Witches who once prophesied that Macbeth would be King of Scotland. The Witches, who seem to be forever chanting their litany of “Double, double toil and trouble:/Fire burn and cauldron bubble,” offer Macbeth an ambiguous set of visions, but Macbeth takes comfort from their prophecies that “none of woman born/Shall harm Macbeth”, and that “Macbeth shall never vanquished be until/Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill/Shall come against him.”These prophecies seem reassuring to Macbeth: imagine some future tyrannical U.S. President being told that he won’t fall from power until the Jefferson National Forest in southwestern Virginia attacks Washington, D.C.! But the playgoer or reader already senses that the witches’ prophecies, while technically true, leave out relevant facts or considerations in a manner that will contribute to Macbeth’s ultimate undoing.In England, King Duncan’s son Malcolm hopes to lead an army of English soldiers and Scottish revolutionaries against the tyrannical Macbeth, though he is cautious about choosing his allies, pointing out to Macduff that “Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.” Just as Malcolm comes to trust and confide in Macduff, the awful news comes that Macduff’s wife and children have all been murdered, causing Macduff to ask, in disbelief, “At one fell swoop?” While many might wonder whether a real-life Macduff wouldn’t have seen to his family’s safety first, and fled Scotland thereafter, the fact remains that the play’s Macduff now has a more-than-firm motive for seeking revenge.Meanwhile, back in Scotland, Lady Macbeth has finally begun to show evidence that the evil she has done is taking its toll upon her. She sleepwalks, and mutters self-incriminating remarks in her sleep, and compulsively washes her hands, saying to herself things like “Out, damned spot, out I say!”, and she expresses her sense that “All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.” It has taken longer for Lady Macbeth than it did for her husband, but conscience has finally made itself apparent. Like Macbeth, who said that his bloody hand would dye the green sea red if he tried to wash off the blood, Lady Macbeth realizes that her hand is stained with blood-guilt that cannot be washed away: “What’s done cannot be undone.”Macbeth asks a doctor to help the distressed Lady Macbeth, saying, “Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?” But on a deeper level, he seems to know that both he and his wife are doomed. He says to himself “I have supped full with horrors”, states that “I begin to be aweary of the sun”, and adds that “I have lived long enough. My way of life is fallen into the sere, the yellow leaf…” All of these existential reflections lead up to a statement of despair that constitutes one of the best-known passages in all of Shakespeare’s work:Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrowCreeps in this petty pace from day to dayTo the last syllable of recorded time,And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stageAnd then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.This speech, which among other things inspired the title of William Faulkner’s novel The Sound and the Fury (1929), is so splendidly bleak. Life is a candle with a short wick – an impoverished actor whose obscure career is soon to end, leaving him forgotten and unknown – a meaningless story that is told by a person without understanding. One senses a certain relief in Macbeth when he finally encounters Macduff, learns how he has been betrayed by the witches’ partially-true-but-incomplete prophecies, and draws his sword for one last bloody encounter, crying out, “Lay on, Macduff,/And damned be him that first cries, ‘Hold, enough!’”Macbeth moves like armoured cavalry on the gallop, with a sense of fatalism that makes the actions of its characters seem as inevitable as cold rain in Scotland. It is the most direct, linear, and action-packed of all Shakespeare’s tragedies, and for that reason it is no surprise that it has been filmed so often, including film adaptations by Orson Welles (1948), Akira Kurosawa (1957), Roman Polanski (1971), and most recently Joel Coen (2021). And Macbeth is unique among Shakespeare’s plays in being the centre of its own bit of playhouse legend – the “Scottish curse.” According to this diverting bit of theatrical folklore, disaster will befall any production of Macbeth where members of the company actually call the play Macbeth; instead, one must call it “the Scottish play.” The existence of this theatrical superstition speaks to the unique power of Macbeth – as if those three witches, somewhere out on the Scottish heath, were still about their work.

5811103542	The play is about a weak, but an ambitious, power hungry man. His chance meeting up with 3 witches in the forest on his way back to his king Duncan. The 3 witches begin to tell him of their prophecy. One that he will be King and said that the present king must die first. Upon telling his wife, Lady Macbeth, of these predictions she immediately clings to. She becomes determined in finding the ways for her husband to precede. She urges Macbeth, a nobleman, to make this happen. Where Macbeth has doubts, she is gung-ho! Incredible character that she is she continues to plant ways forward into Macbeth’s head encouraging him toward evil! Macbeth then goes onto slaughter anyone in his way. Lady Macbeth becomes unstable and Macbeth can’t live with himself for killing King Duncan. “Blood will have Blood 🩸.”Ghosts appear in the play of the dead has an effect on Macbeth and his wife that they fall into paranoia, become frightened and mentally unstable. Scottish noblemen decide to take the side against Macbeth and kill him after he had murdered their friend Macduff, his wife and his heirs. Ambition, paranoia and his butchery become the norm for Macbeth. He killed those of his friends and loyal to him. He is ruined! Lady Macbeth kills herself and Macbeth, never becoming king is beheaded. And thus ends this disturbing play. Its a short play but packed with an awesome story. One that gave me a nightmare! If you can get past the dialogue period then you’ll enjoy. Recommended!! Read it!

1517137811	"Something wicked this way comes."MACBETH boasts Shakespeare's most terrifying villain in that Macbeth is the Shakespearean villain that most reminds us of ourselves! Macbeth makes that first mistake, the murder of his king, and then he slides down the slippery slope killing more and more in order to cover up his original deed. What makes Macbeth so horrible is that he has guilt about his actions, unlike Shakespeare's other villains. However, he finds himself so ensnared in the web of murder and deceit that he can't ever get out. His murderous tentacles stretch out to engulf his best friend, an innocent women and her children, and others. It is in that terrifying feeling of a guilty conscience and no escape that we all can share, and thus Macbeth is truly frightening! We recognize him!This play, while one of Shakespeare's shortest, boast two of his finest creations in Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. The couple sizzles with sexuality, unlike most Shakespearean marriages, and the scenes where Lady Macbeth drives along her husband's weakening ambitions are as exciting as they come.The supporting cast in this play is rather one note (with a few exceptions, the Porter chief among them) and I think Shakespeare intended it that way. This is an intimate study in evil, and its power over decent individuals, and the supporting cast is meant to merely back up these assertions about the leading couple, not distract from them.Lady Macbeth tells her husband that if he "screws his courage to the sticking place, we will not fail." Bad advice, but we the reader get to go along for the nihilistic ride that follows.Quotes:• “Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires.”• “Fair is foul, and foul is fair.”• “False face must hide what the false heart doth know.”• “We fail? But screw your courage to the sticking place and will not fail.”• “I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm is often laudable, to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly.”• “I have supped full with horrors.”A note on the Pelican edition...its opening essay by Stephen Orgel is a quick read, and an illuminating one. I have always preferred these editions to other Shakespeare editions. Nicely priced and well researched.
5560233138	“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrowCreeps in this petty pace from day to dayTo the last syllable of recorded time.And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle.Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.”
651439138	“It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.”Macbeth is a very bloodthirsty play. Each page seems saturated with blood. Blood and slaughter are constantly in the characters' minds, and Shakespeare ensures that our thoughts too are steeped in the imagery of blood. The line spoken by Duncan at the start of scene two “What bloody man is that?” immediately impresses us with the idea of blood. It is the play's real first scene, introducing the main characters after the witches' scene; that extraordinary attention-grabbing glimpse of the supernatural. It is not in fact Shakespeare's bloodiest play. “Titus Andronicus” has that honour. Nor is it as bloody as some of the slightly later Jacobean revenge tragedies such as John Webster's “The Duchess of Malfi” of around 1613. Macbeth is an exciting, thrilling play about obsessive, overwhelming ambition, and the extremes to which both men and women can ultimately go to achieve their desires. Although as it develops, revenge certainly becomes the driving force behind some characters. Macbeth is an unholy mixture, with great gobbets of guilt and paranoia, suspicion, madness, arrogance and a good, gouty, delicious (to an Elizabethan or Jacobean mind) dollop of death. There is both suicide and murder; plus much evidence of despicable dishonour and disloyalty, lies, subterfuge, and spurts of savagery. There is also a good spattering of the supernatural, starting as it does in dramatic intensity with thunder, lightning, and three hideous witches, cackling,“When shall we three meet again In thunder, lightning, or in rain? When the hurlyburly's done, When the battle's lost and won”We quickly learn that these crones speak in riddles, and declaim fiendish portents having a deeper significance; which will be clotted clues as to the future,“Fair is foul, and foul is fair:Hover through the fog and filthy air.”The action quickly steps up. This is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy, and it seems to hurtle itself forward. The characters seem impelled recklessly towards their own doom. Here are Macbeth's ambitious lurking thoughts,“...Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires”Married with his incipient reluctance,“If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown meWithout my stir”And see, here is Lady Macbeth, whom we perceive to be the stronger force. She it is who has the determination; the will to succeed whatever the cost. Not for her any feminine wiles, nor any weaknesses to hold her back,“... unsex me here,And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-fullOf direst cruelty!” She pleads with the spirits to “make thick my blood”And urges Macbeth, her doubting husband, to,“...look like the innocent flower,But be the serpent under't”Macbeth remains reluctant, but muses, encouraged and emboldened,“If were done - when t'is done - then t'were wellIt were done quickly”feeling guilt that he is considering betraying his kinsman and friend; feeling that he,“... should against his murderer shut the door,Not bear the knife myself”But he knows that his “vaulting ambition” will win through and eventually succeed. A tentative plea to his wife of,“If we should fail?” is met roundly with,“We fail: But screw your courage to the sticking place,And we'll not fail!”And Macbeth, finally of the same mind, resolves to himself,“False face must hide what the false heart doth know.”It is a breathtakingly passionate whirlwind of a first Act. Beginning in a storm with the witches, we are instantly caught up in the drama, the hunger for power, the blood-drenched drip of death; the predestined struggle of events to come.The reason for the blood-sodden timbre of this book lies with the public's taste for gobbets of gore at the time. The England of 1603 was a very different place from ours, over 400 years later. Life was cheap, and sensibilities were therefore very different. The backdrop to the play is as savage as any of the fictitious events in the play. Macbeth is, of course, set in Scotland, (except for one scene in England, at the end of Act 4.) In real life, the King of Scotland, James VI, had just acceded to the throne of England, thereby becoming James I of England. His own father had been murdered, and his mother, Mary Queen of Scots, had been beheaded. A mere two year later, Guy Fawkes was to plot with other noblemen, and attempt to burn down the Houses of Parliament. Their plot was uncovered, and to this very day, English children will burn effigies of Guy Fawkes on “Guy Fawkes” or “Bonfire” night, every November 5th.The supernatural was also at the forefront of people's minds. Witches and witchcraft both flourished, and both the king and the commoners alike were fascinated by magic and sorcery. Superstition and ignorance were rife.Somewhere around this time, maybe in 1605, Shakespeare created this play, Macbeth, arguably his greatest tragedy. This background of treason, bloodlust and sorcery is what Shakepeare's audiences experienced as their normal life. It is perhaps surprising that the play is not even more drenched in blood. Many of the most violent scenes are implied or reported, happening offstage. Hence the play is still riveting to a modern reader, even one like myself who has never been able to stomach watching “The Duchess of Malfi” all the way through. It is an incredible feat to be able to write so timelessly, to appeal to audiences so many centuries apart.We see Macbeth's feelings of guilt seep through,“Is this a dagger which I see before me?The handle towards my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:I have thee not, and yet I see thee still”“I am afraid to think what I have done;Look on't again I dare not.”“Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!”And his wife's manic determination; the female, deadlier than the male, and ambitious to the point of literal craziness,“Infirm of purpose!Give me the daggers”And we see what is to come of her; we witness her progressive mental breakdown,“Out, damned spot! out, I say!”“...Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?”Her constant handwashing is symbolic, of course, but also a well-documented indication of mental disorder to this day, “...all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand”The witches' portents: a magical number, three witches, and a magical, nonsensical-seeming trio of portents, which satisfyingly do have a very real meaning. There is no compromise here. Even the woods, incredibly but quite literally, do appear to move. The witches urge Macbeth to,“Be bloody, bold and resolute; laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth” And this final shock, a horrifying, brutally described Caesarian fact,“...Macduff was from his mother's wombUntimely ripped” impressed me so much on my first reading of this play, that I spent the next year obsessed with drawing charcoal black and red pictures of embryos and foetuses, at various stages, to the dismay of my gentle and rather effete male Art teacher. And a close friend urged me never to destroy another picture in similar vein, based on the themes in Macbeth. (Presumably the passion and intensity of my drawing had conveyed itself to her, rather than any particular skill on my part.) My first experience of reading Shakespeare was, like many people's, at school. I had read one play a year. Macbeth was my fifth Shakespeare play, and the first to really grab me. It was the first one I studied for a serious examination (then called "O" level, or GCE) in English Literature rather than an internal school exam. Coincidentally, my then slightly older boyfriend (now husband) was also studying the play for the next level up - for his "A" levels. Serendipity? Or the mark of a great play, one which was simultaneously chosen by two different schools, working towards two different examination levels, set by two different examination boards.It is a riveting, hair-raising and truly great dramatic masterpiece, this play about a “dead butcher and his fiend-like queen”, yet it is timeless in working through its themes. Regularly we are witness to both the psychological and physical damage to individuals who display this scheming behaviour. Still there are people who seek power for its own sake; people who are so politically ambitious that the effects destroy them utterly. “What's done is done.”It would be absurd for me to attempt to add any new critical insights, when a quick look at Goodreads alone shows 463,861 ratings. These are merely my personal thoughts and reactions. Another sign of its magnitude, to me personally, is that I have never sat down and read the text since all those decades ago, yet many of the words still resonated with me now; still seemed so familiar after all this time. Now I am itching to see a live performance. I wonder if "Shakespeare's Globe" theatre on the South Bank has it planned in its upcoming agenda...“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,To the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.”
1985142579	All causes shall give way: I am in bloodStepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,Returning were as tedious as go o’er. Okay, first of all, reading Shakespeare's plays doesn't work unless you see them first. These plays deserve to be seen, with acting and dramatic scenes. This play especially is one that thrives off the acting; having a fantastic and compelling Macbeth and especially Lady Macbeth is central. On stage, though, this play can be fabulous and compelling. Ignoring the need for performance, I think this is a solid tragedy, if not my favorite one. Seeing that this is Shakespeare, the language is of course gorgeous. But as is usual, the real power of this show comes through the characters and the themes. Below this, you'll find some random thoughts and feelings. ➽ I think it's interesting that this is one of the least tragic of Shakespeare’s tragedies. Macbeth is destroyed by his ambition, as many of Shakespeare’s other characters are, but he’s evil from the beginning. This reads as more of an odd version of a cautionary tale than a true tragedy; if you think about it, the ending is a win for the heroes. ➽ Yet we also feel as if it's a tragedy because we see it from the points of view of the villains. Lady Macbeth and Macbeth are not good people, and never were - yet we see their struggles, rather than the struggles of those they oppress. ➽ LADY M. I love that she starts off as the ambitious one, yet is also the one we see the most humanity out of; she has the capacity to do evil, yet she's also the one who feels the most remorse. Especially when well-acted. ➽ I'm not a fan of the conclusion. I think everything builds up to a fantastic conclusion, and then the book stutters to an end. Lady Macbeth dies offscreen, rather than onscreen. Despite their good soliloquys towards the end, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's actual deaths didn't work for me.➽ If you're looking for more thoughts and enthusiasm, check out Emma and Jason's reviews.

6687932140	Vengeance is a dish best served severed. "McBeth" is a tale of power, treachery, cowardice, gluttony, and guilt. McBeth has just fought valiantly for king and country and been rewarded with new noble titles. However, after seeing apparitions from witches whereby McBeth wears the crown, Lady McBeth convinces her husband to commit regicide despite the latter's hesitation. McBeth's newfound power is not guaranteed as rumours abound, and power brokers flee for safety in foreign lands. McBeth revels in this power, whereas Lady McBeth's resolve wavers. Be careful what you wish for. You might get it, but only fleetingly and at the cost of everything.
3684346945	“Look like the innocent flower,But be the serpent under't.”Macbeth has got to be one of my favourite Shakespearean tragedies. I’d lost hope in the playwright after reading Romeo & Juliet last year, mainly because insta love—even in the 14th century— pains me. I should’ve gotten the hint that enjoying Julius Caesar would entail only good things for this play. The darker the better, it seems. ~★~ What is this play about? ~★~ If you haven’t already heard (which I’m sure you have), Macbeth follows a loyal general to the King of Scotland. When three witches prophesize that he will soon become King, the general Macbeth quickly overcomes his scepticism and begins contemplating murdering the ruler to take his place.~★~Despite Macbeth being one of Shakespeare’s shortest plays, I think it is easily one of the most interesting. The exploration of human nature and our desire for power was executed so well; you’re sure to become invested in the oncoming events. It was fascinating to follow Macbeth as he went from an honourable man to a cruel tyrant. Never did I expect a work written in the 1600’s (by a man no less) to include women with so much power. Lady Macbeth —despite her questionable nature— was pleasantly surprising in her influence. I loved knowing that she acted as Macbeth’s “dearest partner in greatness” despite the time period suggesting otherwise. While the turnout of her character was expected, it was nice to see she and the witches play an integral role in the proceedings of the play. Alas, I very much enjoyed this (and wish I can someday see it performed). It’s obvious why Macbeth is one of Shakespeare’s most popular plays, and I’m glad to have studied it.
1432704106	This was really interesting, and the audiobook I listened to was GREAT, but it wasn't my favorite Shakespeare. Maybe I'm just not a fan of some tragedies? In Macbeth, everyone is just the worst, but it's very interesting to read about them even if I don't love it.I want to try reading it again / seeing it, but reading it so spread out and not actually seeing it played out probably hurt my rating.

It is that something itself”. یعنی نوشته‌های جیمز جویس از این لحاظ مهم نیستند که حامل یا دربارۀ چیزهایی جالب اند (مثلا بن‌مایه‌های جذاب، یا پلات درگیرکننده و شخصیت‌پردازیِ ناب) بلکه «خودِ زبان» است که آن چیزی است که اهمیت توجه دارد. به بیانی «شالوده/بافتِ زیباشناسانۀ خودِ زبان» است که اهمیت دارد. به بیانِ اما اسمیت (2013) در مکبث نیز این «خودِ زبان» اثر است که اهمیتِ مطالعه دارد. به بیانِ اسمیت، این تجربۀ اصیلِ مکبث، همانا تجربۀ زبانیِ اثر است.الان نمی‌خوام از شئونِ این زبان‌پردازی‌ها و زبانِ آثار شکسپیر حرف بزنم که اولا حرفِ دهنِ من نیست، دوما خودِ این یه جهانی وقت‌گذاری می‌خواد و فعلا نمی‌خوام شکسپیرشناس باشم و سوم اینکه برای مرورِ عمومیِ مکبث شاید لازم نباشه. ولی برای کسی که بخواد اندکی بیشتر با این زبانِ شکسپیر آشنا بشه، کتابِ (2013) “Macbeth Language and Writing” از اما اسمیت بسیار راهنمای خوبی برای شروع خواهد بود.برای خواندنِ متنِ انگلیسیِ اثر، علاوه بر سریِ no fear Shakespeare که واقعا خوب است، سری کتاب‌های Shakespeare made easy و Shakespeare made simple می‌توانند خوب باشند. البته که کلنجار رفتن با متنِ شکسپیر و سعی در فهمِ ماهیتِ شعریِ اثر اهمیت و لذتِ خاصی خواهد داشت. البته می‌توان نشان داد که بازآرایی کردن و به بیانی paraphrase متنِ نمایشنامه شکسپیر، جوهره و ماهیتِ شعریِ اثر را نابود خواهد کرد.شاید خودِ شخصیتِ مکبثِ نمایشنامه هم درگیر همین زبانِ شاعرانۀ «مکبث» شده باشد.در ادامه برای تمایزگذاشتن بین متنِ نمایشنامۀ «مکبث» و شخصیتِ مکبث در نمایشنامه، از متنِ نمایش به صورت «مکبث» در میان گیومه و از شخصیتِ مکبث همین‌جوری به صورت شخصیت مکبث استفاده می‌کنم. لازمه این تمایز :))تعبیر شعر و مخمصۀ شخصیتِ مکبث:به بیانِ اسمیت (2013): «سقوطِ [شخصیتِ] مکبث به علتِ عدم توانایی‌اش در خواندن است». مشخصا دیالوگ‌های شعریِ «سه خواهر جادو/Three Witches» که تخمِ شک و تردید را در دلِ مکبث می‌اندازد چنین اهمیتی دارد. اینجا این عبارتِ اسمیت سویۀ جذابی از مکبث را به ما نشان می‌دهد:" In this way, the witches are poets, and Macbeth is a reader who […] comes to recognize the intrinsic ambiguity of the text in front of him."یعنی همین شاعرانه بودنِ عبارات خواهران جادو است که مکبث را به سوی «تراژدیِ محتومِ» خود سوق می‌دهد. از زبان، گریزی مختصر به «تراژدیِ مکبث» می‌زنیم.پارادوکس یا مسئلۀ تراژدی:تراژدی حامل یک پارادوکس است، ما در تراژدی بازنمایی سیر وقایعی به غایت وحشتاک و دلهره‌آور را شاهد ایم (طبعا نابودی شخصیتِ تراژدی در پایان، «شادان» نیست)، اما از خواندن/دیدنِ این سیر وقایع به خرسندی یا وجد می‌رسیم؛ علت از چیست؟ پاسخ به این سوال، از همان اول قدم‌های نسج گرفتنِ تراژدی در یونان باستان و تاملات فلسفیِ بشرِ غربی (افلاطون و ارسطو) محل سوال بوده است و به بیانی همین پارادوکس، «مسئلۀ تراژدی» است. ارسطو در رسالۀ بوطیقا (فن‌شعر) که از قضی ناتمام مانده است، بر فلسفۀ ادبیات و مشخصا بحث از شخصیت، پلات و ماهیتِ تراژدی‌های یونانی می پردازد. کتابِ «فلسفۀ تراژدی» از جولیان یانگ با ترجمۀ خوبی از حسن امیری‌آرا، برای درگیری با تراژدی عالی است. در ادامه در کنارِ منبعِ اصلی (2018) که معرفی‌اش در بخش (1) از مرور رفت، گه‌گاه از کتاب یانگ (2013) هم استفاده خواهم کرد.استعارۀ «خواست خدایان» و سیر تکوینِ وقایعِ تراژدی:در ترجمۀ انگلیسیِ نمایشنامۀ ادیپِ سوفوکل از R. C. Trevelyan داریم:Come, for laments there is no more need:Then cease to bewail him;For the will of the Gods is accomplished.در منطقِ تراژدی‌ها (مشخصا تراژدی‌های باستانی)، مسیرِ تکوینِ امرِ محتومِ تراژیک که بر سرِ شخصیت/شخصیت‌ها و ملتِ اصلی پدید می‌آید را شاهد ایم. یعنی در تراژدی سیرِ وقایعی را شاهد ایم که مشخصا رو به «خواستِ خدایان/will of the Gods» دارد و خواست خدایان باید محقق شود و به پایانی تراژیک برسیم. برای داوری این مورد که این خواست خدایان در تراژدی دقیقا یعنی چه و چه نسبتِ بیامتنی‌ای میان تراژدی یونان باستان و سیرِ تکوینِ وقایعِ تراژدی‌های شکسپیر هست، کارِ من نیست، اما از این «خواستِ خدایان» به صورت استعاری و به عنوان «رانۀ محتوم‌سازِ پایان تراژیکِ تراژدی» استفاده می‌کنم. توضیح خواهم داد.اشعار سه خواهر جادو:در مکبث‌، سه خواهر جادو با گفتن پیش‌گویی‌های خود به مکبثی در درون خود یک جاه‌طلبیِ عمیق دارد، سیر وقایعی را پی می‌ریزند که مکبث را به پایانِ تراژیک خود رهسپار می‌کند. اینجا مسئلۀ زبان و شعریتِ متن «مکبث» و این مورد که خواهران جادو تماما شعری سخن می‌رانند، اهمیت پیدا می‌کند. شخصیتِ مکبث همان خواننده‌ایست که سعی در تعبیر و تفسیرِ «شعر»های پیش روی خود دارد و به استدلال اسمیت (2013) شخصیتِ مکبث در همین تعبیرِ غلط خود بوده است که غرقِ اشتباه شده است. حال این سوءتعبیر چه نسبتی با حیثِ تراژیک مکبث و استعارۀ «خواست خدایان» دارد؟ کلیاتی از ایده‌ام را شرح خواهم داد:صرفا قرار است چیزها شفاف باشند:بگذارید از خارج از جهان داستانی آغاز کنم. فعلا فرض می‌گیریم با اعمالی کار داریم که ریشه در باورهای ما دارند. در این مسیر، باورها هم که محل بحث اند باورهایی گزاره‌ای اند (همین بحث که «آیا باور ضرورتا گزاره‌ای است یا نه؟» ترسناک بحث بزرگی است). فرض می‌کنیم این باورها یا باورِ خاصِ مورد بحث، باوری است که از تعبیرِ یک متن/شعر/نوشته/تصویر/فیلم/خاطره و جز آن حاصل شده است (تک تکِ این منابعِ محلِ تعبیر و تفسیر می‌توانند ماهیتِ یکتای خود را داشته باشند و سخت باشد که تعبیر یک نقاشیِ مدرن هم‌کفِ تفسیرِ یک رمانِ کلاسیکِ ادبیات انگلیس باشد). پس خیلی ساده، ما متنی را می‌خوانیم، از آن برداشتی داریم، با آن برداشت باوری را شکل خواهیم داد که به واسطۀ آن باور به کنش و عملی خاص مبادرت می‌ورزیم. همانطور که زندگی به سخت‌ترین شکلِ ممکن به ما آموخته است، هر عمل و کنشی پیامدهایی دارد که چه بسا خارج از اراده و خواست ما است. پس می‌بینیم که می‌توان با ردگیریِ یک تعبیر به پیامد رسید. در متنِ روایی و داستانی (اعم از شعرِ روایی، داستانِ بلند، داستان کوتاه، فیلم‌نامه و نمایشنامه) به شکیل‌ترین و علت‌معلولی‌ترین تصویر ممکن می‌توانیم این سلسله‌ وقایع که از تعبیر آغاز به پیامد ختم می‌شود را رهگیری کنیم (طبعا بحث از چندتعبیریِ متن ادبی و آثار ادبی‌ای که قصد دارند که علیه برداشت‌های سلسه‌وار و سازه‌وار باشند، محل بحث نیست).بدیهی‌بودنِ بحث از سر و روی پاراگراف بالا می‌بارد (بالاخره باوری داریم و ناظر به آن یا به واسطۀ آن عملی انجام می‌دهیم)، اما همین الان امکان این است که نشان بدهیم در تک تکِ اقدام و گذار از مرحله‌های سلسه‌وار بالا، می‌توان ان‌قلت آورد و محل بحث باشد. در تراژدی مکبث، از مرحله اول، متنی که محلِ تعبیر است، تا مرحلۀ آخر، پیامدِ کنشِ شخصیت، را به تمیزی می‌توان نشان داد (شرح مکبث براساس این رویه، باشد برای بازخوانی‌های آتی).در نهایت، می‌توان با رویۀ منطقی بالا و محتوایی که نمایشنامه به ما تقدیم می‌کند نشان داد شخصیتِ مکبث راهی نداشت جز اینکه در گیرِ این تراژدی باشد و ضرورتا با پروفایل شخصیتی‌ای که شخصیتِ مکبث دارد، متنی که محل تعبیر او بوده است (اشعار و پیش‌بینی‌های خواهران جادو) و شرایط زمینه‌ای (مانند شخصیتِ لیدی مکبث و شرایط سیاسی دانمارکِ آن دوران)، شروطِ کافیِ نسج چیزی بودند که به آن تراژدیِ مکبث می‌گوییم. به بیانی، تعبیرِ شخصیتِ مکبث از اشعار خواهران جادو، «رانۀ محتوم‌سازِ پایان تراژیکِ تراژدی» بود، زیرا شخصیتِ مکبث را به درونِ این سلسه وقایعی انداخت که ضرورتا و «خدای‌گونه» او را به پایانِ تراژیکِ خود رهسپار خواهد کرد؛ یکی شرطِ کافیِ آغازِ سلسۀ محتومِ تراژدی، تعبیرِ شخصیتِ مکبث از یک «متنِ شعری» است.من به عنوانِ مخاطب تراژدی چه فهمِ ممکنی خواهم داشت؟بحث اساسی دیگر اینجا،‌ وضعیت ما به عنوان یک مخاطب فکور و سراپاحاضر برای تراژدی است. به بیانی،‌ مای خواننده از جزییات یک روایت تراژیک،‌ چه آورده کلی‌ای خواهیم داشت؟به بیان یانگ (۲۰۱۳):«تراژدی حقایق مهمی در مورد طبیعت انسان،‌ یا به عبارت دقیق‌تر، طبایع انسان، به ما می‌گوید. ما چیزهایی از این دست یاد می‌گیریم: "افراد تیپ T به احتمال خیلی زیاد در شرایط C اعمالی از نوع A انجام خواهند داد."»در «مکبث»، نیز داستان روایت‌شده از شخصیت مکبث آینه‌ای خواهد بود برای فهم کلیتی بنامِ طبایع انسانی‌ که شرح آن را بارها در تفسیرهای مکبث و تراژدی‌های مکبث شنیده ایم.در این لحظه، پایانِ ردگذاری از خوانشِ نخست مکبث را اعلام می‌دارم._________________________________در ادامه دو فکت‌چک از زندگی شکسپیر را بر اساس کتاب 30 Great Myths about Shakespeare خواهم آورد (برای مشاهده سه فکت دیگر،‌ مرور Dream.M در گودریدز رجوع کنید).افسانه‌ها و فکت‌های مورد بررسی اینان اند:１. شکسپیر سواد درست‌وحسابی نداشته است (Myth2).２. نوشته‌های شکسپیر از لحاظِ سیاسی و اخلاقِ امروزین محل اشکال است (Myth6). شکسپیر و متن‌هایی که می‌خوانده است: از سواد شکسپیر آغاز می‌کنیم (Myth2). همواره تصویر نابغه‌ای که بدون آموزش درست‌وحسابی و صرفا بخاطر «نابغه»بودن خود گل کند،‌ برای آدم جذاب است. تصویر شکسپیر نیز از این اسطورپردازی خالی نیست؛ این شکسپیری که تاریخ را تکان داده اند، اسطوره‌ای خواهد شد اگر صرفا به واسطه نبوغ و از دل برآمدنش چنین کرده باشد که کرده است.از میلتونِ بزرگ گرفته است تا خرواری نویسنده و ادیب بزرگِ دیگر در تاریخ، در تنورِ این تصویر از شکسپیر به عنوانِ فردی که «نخوانده معلم صدها هزار معلم شد» دمیده اند. اما علاوه‌بر اینکه به احتمال بالا شکسپیر (با توجه به بضاعت مزجاتِ زمانه‌اش) در مدارس آموزش گرامر (و تلویحا رتوریک) شرکت کرده است و فراتر از آن، خود را غرق در مباحث و نوشته‌های روشنفکری و فلسفیِ زمانه‌اش کرده است. یعنی شاید شکسپیر تحصیلِ آکادمیکِ آن‌چنانی نداشته باشد (که با توجه به شرایطِ تاریخیِ اواخر قرن 16 و اوایل 17 طبیعی است)، اما خود را در آثارِ فلاسفۀ زمانِ خود مانند مونتی و... غرق کرده بوده است و این نشان می‌دهد که حتی شکسپیر هم از پوچِ محض چیزی خلق نکرده و در شبکه‌ای از افکار بوده است که متون خود را خلق کرده است.البته اینکه شکسپیر دقیقا چه متونی را می‌خوانده، آن‌چنان بر محققین آشکار نیست، زیرا که به خواستِ خود شکسپیر مجموعه آثارش در یک کالکشن و مجموعه به نام خودِ شکسپیر نمانده و اهدا شده است و رفته است! اما با دقت‌های لغت‌شناسانه و لغت‌نامه‌ای می‌توان با تقریبی چند اثری که شکسپیر از آنها نوشیده است را حدس زد.در نهایت، اما اسمیت (2013) بحثِ سواد داشتنِ شکسپیر را اینگونه جمع‌بندی می‌کند که تحصیل کردنِ رسمیِ شکسپیر پایه‌های لازم برای فهم ادبیات کلاسیک و ساختارهای رتوریک را ایجاد کرد، اما بنیان‌های قویِ تفکر و زبانِ خود را، خودِ شکسپیر برای خود ساخته است با درگیری مداوم با فضای فکریِ زمانۀ خودش. نقادیِ منظرگاه‌های سیاسیِ نوشته‌های شکسپیر:امروزه ذهنِ خواننده/بینندۀ آثار هنری به بسیاری از بازنمایی‌ها در آثار حساس شده است؛ دیگر سیاه‌پوست بودن اگر نشانه‌ای از کم‌هوشی و هزارتا برچسبِ من‌درآوردیِ نژادیِ دیگر باشد، نه تنها باعث اثرگذاری برخواننده نمی‌شود، بلکه واکنش جدیِ خواننده را در برخواهد داشت. مخاطب دیگر تحقیرِ اقلیت‌ها را «طبیعیِ» متن ادبی نمی‌داند. شرایط در دورۀ الیزابت (که زمانۀ زیستِ شکسپیر است) چنین مختصاتی نداشته است؛ پس آیا شکسپیر آلوده با نظریاتِ سیاسی ناصواب بوده است؟ همه بلی هم خیر.بالاخره نحوۀ بازنمایی اقلیت‌ها/ Minorities مانند سیاهان، یهودیان، زنان، کاتولیک‌ها و... (طبعا می‌دانیم که در نظریۀ ادبی و مطالعات فمنیستی و... اقلیت به معنای گروهی است که توسط قدرتِ فائقه نوعی از سرکوب را تحمل می‌کنند، و الا مثلا بعید است زنان با داشتن 50درصد جمعیت جامعه، «اقلیت» به معنای عرفیِ کلمه باشند)، در آثار شکسپیر بسیار رنگِ زمانۀ خود را گرفته است. نحوۀ بازنمایی غیراخلاقی از حیوانات نیز، به تأسی از زمانۀ نگارش به متنِ شکسپیر رسوخ کرده است. این موارد در بسیاری از نمایشنامه‌های شکسپیر از جمله «تاجر ونیزی»، «مکبث»، «تیتوس آندرونیکوس» و... وجود دارد.برای نمونه، در مکبث مرگِ مکداف مانند «شکارشدن آهو» توصیف می‌شود و در این توصیف حداقلی از همدلی با حیوان/آهویی که به واسطۀ آن تشبیه انجام شده را شاهد نخواهیم بود. به بیانی، مکداف به «آهوی کشته‌شده/ murdered deer» تشبیه می‌شود و تداعیِ مرگ رقت‌انگیز و... به ذهنِ خواننده تداعی شود و این طبعا با تیمارخواهیِ امروزی که برای حیوانات داریم، سرِ ناسازگاری دارد.از نحوۀ بازنمایی یهودیان به مثابۀ انسان‌های طماع که با ربا گرفتن خونِ مردم را در شیشه می‌کنند نیز در «تاجر ونیزی» بسیار تکرار شده است به حدی که در کتب و ارائه‌های تاریخِ پولیِ جهان نیز این تصویر از یهودیان از قضی با ارجاع به شکسپیر محل توجه است.اما این تمام موضوع نیست. تکنیکی روایی در شکسپیر هست که مسیری برای همدلی با دیگری و فهمِ غیریت که به همدلی برسد را در خود دارد؛ و آن همانا خیال‌کردن و تصورکردنِ موقعیت از دیدگاهِ درونیِ شخصِ بیرونی/غیر است. یعنی کسبِ نظرگاه اقلیت و نگاه کردن به موقعیت از دیدگاه آن.با این حال، ماهیت سیاسیِ نمایش‌های شکسپیر نه آنچنان مترقی‌تر از زمانۀ خود بوده است، نه آن‌چنان آلوده به نگاه‌های قالبی و کلیشه‌ای موجود، شکسپیر خود راه‌هایی برای فهمِ اقلیت‌ها قرار داده است. بالاخره هرزمانه‌ای از نظرگاه خود شکسپیر را می‌خواند و شاید با نظرگاه‌های همدلانه و اخلاقیِ امروزین، بتوان ایراداتی به شکسپیر وارد کرد.این دو بخش آخر را تلاش کرده ام وفادارانه بر اساس کتاب اسمیت (2013) بنویسم و طبعا حرفِ نهایی نیست و تا جهان باشه، حرف از شکسپیر زده اند و حرف زده خواهد شد.در آخر هم واقعا خیلی زیاد از رویا تشکر می‌کنم که هست که من یکی جرئت کردم شکسپیر بخونم. واقعا همراه لازمه این مسیرهای صعب‌العبور! _________________________________

90763734	After a discussion of this play that went over 100 comments, a review seems at once superfluous and necessary to give greater exposure to an excellent conversation. One of the best things about Goodreads is that it provides a forum to hash out discrepancies of opinion thoughtfully and passionately, so that our own feelings and understandings can be challenged by and challenging for others. I think what you’ll find below is a perfect example of this, enacted by people who care deeply about Shakespeare and about literature. People who have been changed by what they’ve read and who hope to allow others to experience something similar, to allow them to understand why certain themes are so vitally important. I like to think that my opinions, even immediately after finishing a book, are solid and well-considered. And usually this delusion goes more or less unchallenged. But below, something unusual happened, made more so by the fact that I’d done no more than give a rating and list a few undercooked criticisms. I was forced to reconsider my reading to the point where I now have to admit that I have very little confidence in my criticisms and in my response to this play. I don’t feel like I gave it my best effort because, frankly, some of the rejoinders I’ve heard are pretty impressive. Take this comment from David, who was responding to my complaint that Macbeth and Lady Macbeth seemed to lack adequate moral reasoning and background in the initial stages (i.e. Macbeth seems ‘good’ but gives in quickly/easily and Lady Macbeth seems overly and inexplicably ambitious/murderous):I think these two characters have very different dilemmas: Macbeth must overcome his aversion to the crime and his sense of honor (as subject of the king) to kill Duncan. (There is much text in the play, I think, committed to exploring his moral compunctions and waffling regarding this.) Lady Macbeth has intellectually set her mind on the crime at the beginning, so the development we see in her character isn't from 'goodness' to evil; it's from her initial intellectual commitment to the crime to her ruination at the hands of her own humanity or, if you will, by her own psychological qualms. So it would almost be nearer to the truth to say that Lady Macbeth's transition is from 'evil' to 'goodness' (in a very loose sense). In some respect, Lady Macbeth is redeemed at the end of the play; that is to say that she does not actively redeem herself, but she is redeemed by the author as a failure of evil. So the two characters have inverted character arcs, a fascinating concept that never occurred to me while reading the play. Macbeth goes from the loyal thane and hero who’s scared to commit even the ‘perfect murder’ to someone who, at the time of his demise, is a raving, fearless, and evil tyrant. Lady Macbeth, as David points out, starts out confident in her trespassing of the laws of goodness but ends up coming undone, emotionally and psychologically, from the weight of such a heinous crime. Lady Macbeth is the original Raskolnikov, a human being who thinks she might be one of the Great Ones, for whom the laws of mankind do not apply. Each of these characters believes that a sign of greatness (and for Lady Macbeth, true manliness) is an ability to achieve a certain Machiavellian perfection, wherein your conscious does not impede your achieving a goal even, and especially, if it requires murder. While Roskalnikov’s plan is more theoretical than pragmatic, the line of thinking is eerily similar. And so is the fallout. Thinking about Lady Macbeth in terms of Crime and Punishment, as Ellen inspired me to do, allowed me to flesh out her progression in a way that I wasn’t able to from the text, either due to my own failings or from what I felt was an overly-rushed story. Dostoevsky gives us an incredibly thorough picture of the post-murder descent into madness, one that can only be relieved, if at all, by coming clean. While Roskalnikov is able to take this route, Lady Macbeth is ultimately trapped, and her ‘redemption’ can only come internally with recognition that her initial perspective was hopelessly flawed and evil. It is, of course, conceivable that Lady Macbeth was not repentant and that she killed herself in madness or in the recognition that she simply wasn't a Great One, a conclusion which does not necessarily imply a belief that she was wrong in her actions. I reject these possibilities, however, because the inversion of the character arcs is such an elegant, brilliant design that nothing else seems artistically plausible. The theme in Macbeth that stuck with me most strongly during my reading was that of prophetic destiny. The power of the witches’ prophesying is not in their ability to actually carry out the events according to their predictions, but simply to plant the seed of an idea that, due to human depravity, provides a barely-needed push to send one into a destructive pursuit of base selfishness and glory. To use a tired but, in this case, warranted analogy: think about George W. Bush and the Iraq War. His religion gave him that little excuse. It planted the idea of destiny and purpose, of achieving something great and glorious that would, however, inevitably lead to the destruction and suffering of so many others, so many innocents. But he didn’t care about that. God had spoken. The witches had spoken. And who was he to get in His way? I love this website. Without it, I’d have probably given this play no more than five extra minutes of thought and moved on. And I’d have missed out on some great themes and ideas, all of which were accessible because of the ability to tap into a few of the exceptional minds here on Goodreads. I can only hope that I continue to keep an open mind and healthy suspicion of my own opinions because—and I barely need mention this—my tendency is very much in the other direction. So give this play the time and thought it deserves. You will be rewarded.

Macbeth e Banquo si battono con valore e portano la vittoria al vecchio e saggio Re Duncan. Il fato che governa la nostra vita, sotto forma di tre streghe, cambia il corso degli eventi. Macbeth, a cui le streghe hanno preconizzato che sarà re, sente che questo è giusto, che il potere deve essere suo. Sarà Lady Macbeth a vincere il suo vacillare, la sua codardia, le sue remore ed a spingerlo a detronizzare violentemente il vecchio Re. Macbeth regnerà da tiranno ed i suoi baroni, infine, lo tradiranno e, con l’aiuto dell’Inghilterra, faranno rotolare la sua testa nella polvere. La determinazione di Lady Macbeth svanirà in un delirio suicida.Ambizione e ricerca del potere, lealtà e tradimento, riconoscenza e malvagità, fato e volontà, il grande teatro della vita e la morte quale destino finale. Con tutta l’intensità di azione e personaggi di cui Shakespeare è stato capace.Nell’ultima versione cinematografica di Joel Coen (2021, da cui tutte le immagini seguenti): bianco e nero ben glaciale, giochi di luci e ombre, desolazione di paesaggi, un castello metafisico, la musica disturbante, grande performance recitativa di Denzel Washington (Macbeth) e Frances McDormand (Lady Macbeth), perfettamente aderente al testo.“Le mie mani hanno il colore delle tue ma io Mi vergognerei ad avere un cuore così bianco.“Eppure non sappiamo ciò che temiamo. Ma galleggiamo su un mare violento e tempestoso, Sbattuti da ogni parte.”“Domani, e domani, e domani, striscia A piccoli passi da un giorno all’altro, Fino all’ultima sillaba del tempo prescritto; E tutti i nostri ieri hanno illuminato A degli stolti la via che conduce Alla morte polverosa. Spegniti, spegniti, Corta candela! La vita non è che un’ombra Che cammina, un povero attore Che si pavoneggia e si agita per la sua ora Sulla scena e del quale poi Non si ode più nulla: è una storia Raccontata da un idiota, piena di rumore E furia, che non significa nulla.”

2094438898	Nhớ hồi đó lúc mình học cấp 2, học lớp tăng cường tiếng Anh, bộ sách American Hotline có giới thiệu vở kịch “Macbeth” của nhà viết kịch vĩ đại nhất thế giới William Shakespeare. Bộ sách này dạy tiếng Anh của người Mỹ, những bài học cũng đa phần là về văn hóa Mỹ, nhưng chắc có lẽ nó do nhà xuất bản Oxford University Press biên soạn nên ít nhiều cũng phải cho một ít văn học Anh vào trong trỏng :D Hồi đó khi mới tiếp cận tác phẩm “Macbeth”, mình thích lắm, và mặc dù cũng chỉ được học lướt qua (kiểu kịch bản tiếng Anh cổ của thánh Shakespeare được biên soạn lại thành một câu chuyện được kể bằng tiếng Anh của người hiện đại), nhưng mình nhớ như in hai dòng mở đầu đầy ấn tượng của vở kịch:“When shall we three meet againIn thunder, lightning, or in rain?”Đó là câu nói của ba chị em phù thủy (the wayward sisters. Từ “wayward” trong tiếng Anh thường dùng để chỉ những gì xấu xa, ám muội), những người đã tiên đoán Macbeth sẽ là Thane of Cawdor (Thane là một tước vị thời Anglo-Saxon, dùng để chỉ những người được vua hoặc quý tộc ban cho đất đai. Tước vị này nằm trên dân thường nhưng bên dưới quý tộc nên cũng chả biết dịch làm sao. Chắc có thể gọi là Lãnh chúa) và sau này sẽ trở thành Vua của Scotland. Và cũng vì quá ấn tượng với câu mở đầu đó mà mình luôn tâm niệm phải đọc cho bằng được “Macbeth”. Kết quả là sau bao nhiêu năm tháng, cuối cùng mình cũng cầm được trên tay cuốn sách “Macbeth” của NXB Wordsworth xuất bản năm 2005, có bao gồm phần Introduction quá hấp dẫn và chi tiết về những điểm cần lưu ý của tác phẩm.Nhờ đọc Introduction mà mình mới biết thì ra sự ra đời của “Macbeth” gắn liền với một giai đoạn lịch sử hẳn hòi. Đó là thời điểm Nữ hoàng Elizabeth I qua đời mà không có con để nối dõi. Nước Anh buộc phải tôn Vua James VI của Scotland thành Vua James I của Vương quốc Anh, thống nhất hai đất nước Anh và Scotland lại. Lý do vì sao vua của Scotland được chọn, là vì ông là hậu duệ của Margaret Tudor - con gái của Vua Henry Tudor (Henry VII, vị vua đầu tiên của nhà Tudor) và Hoàng hậu Elizabeth of York, nên tính ra Vua James VI cũng mang dòng máu Tudor, dù dòng máu ấy đã bị pha trộn với máu nhà Stuart của Scotland ít nhiều :D (Còn vì sao có nhà Tudor thì chắc phải có một buổi học lịch sử về Cuộc Chiến Hoa Hồng (The War of Roses hay còn gọi là The Cousins’ War) quá ^^ ). Vua người gốc Scotland thì phải có một vở kịch về lịch sử Scotland chứ, và thế là “Macbeth” ra đời, là một trong những vở kịch ngắn nhất của Shakespeare, đơn giản là vì Vua James I không thích xem kịch dài :DTính ra thì “Macbeth” khó đọc hơn tác phẩm trước đó của Shakespeare mà mình cũng đọc bằng tiếng Anh là A Midsummer Night's Dream, chắc có lẽ vì “Macbeth” là một bi kịch, trái ngược hoàn toàn với tác phẩm kia (là một vở hài kịch). Tiếng Anh mà Shakespeare sử dụng trong “Macbeth” thì đúng là cổ quá xá cổ (bởi vậy mà ấn bản này của Wordsworth có cả phần Notes để giải thích những điểm khó nắm của tác phẩm và Glossary để tra cứu từ vựng tiếng Anh cổ sử dụng trong vở kịch :D). Mình đọc chay chắc chỉ hiểu được ý chính, chứ còn cách chơi chữ, những hình ảnh phúng dụ, so sánh, liên hệ... mà Shakespeare sử dụng trong tác phẩm thì chịu. Phải nhờ chuyên mục “No Fear Shakespeare” trên SparkNotes cộng với chút kiến thức về cốt truyện của “Macbeth” nhờ việc xem bộ phim dựa trên vở kịch sản xuất năm 2015 thì mình mới hiểu hết được toàn bộ những gì Shakespeare muốn truyền tải ^^ (Phim hay lắm ý, có Michael Fassbender đóng vai Macbeth và người đẹp tài năng Marion Cotillard của Pháp đóng vai Lady Macbeth). Đọc tới đâu thì mình ráng liên hệ cái mình đọc được với những cảnh phim đã xem, lần mò riết thì cũng hiểu được kha khá he he :)))Cốt truyện của “Macbeth” thì chắc nhiều người cũng biết, đó là bi kịch của một vị Lãnh chúa được dự báo là sẽ trở thành Vua của Scotland - lời dự báo phát ra từ miệng của ba chị em phù thủy tượng trưng cho những gì xấu xa, đen tối và siêu nhiên. Dưới sự tác động của vợ mình là Lady Macbeth, Macbeth giết Vua Duncan - vị vua hiện tại của Scotland, một người hòa ái, chính trực và liêm khiết - khiến hai con trai của Duncan là Malcom và Donalbain phải tháo chạy sang Anh và Ireland để xin tá túc, vì nghĩ rằng mình sẽ là người bị giết tiếp theo để đoạt ngai vàng nếu còn ở lại Scotland. Macbeth, với tư cách là em họ của đức vua Duncan quá cố, trở thành Vua của Scotland theo đúng như lời ba chị em phù thủy tiên đoán. Và họ cũng bảo rằng vương triều của Macbeth sẽ tồn tại chừng nào cánh rừng Birnam còn chưa di chuyển tới Dunsinane - nơi tọa lạc tòa lâu đài của Macbeth, và bất kỳ ai sinh ra từ một người phụ nữ đều không thể giết hại Macbeth được.Cái hay của Shakespeare khi xây dựng vở kịch này và hình tượng nhân vật Macbeth, đó là ông không đóng khuôn Macbeth trong hình hài của một kẻ tiểu nhân hay quái vật máu lạnh, người sẵn sàng giết anh họ mình để đoạt lấy ngai vàng. Macbeth, trước viễn cảnh được hứa hẹn sẽ làm vua, đã thấy lương tâm mình bị giằng xé rất nhiều khi nhận ra ai phải chết để mình có được hoàng vị. Ông vừa muốn quyền lực, nhưng cũng vừa khiếp sợ cái chết của Vua Duncan - thứ buộc phải diễn ra để ông lên ngôi. Ông, theo lời miêu tả của Lady Macbeth, là một người mang quá nhiều dòng sữa của lòng nhân ái - thứ sẽ ngăn cản ông thực hiện những việc phải làm để có được quyền lực và làm nên đại sự. Và trước sự thúc ép, tham vấn của người vợ còn đam mê quyền lực hơn cả mình, Macbeth đã lựa chọn để tay mình vấy máu bằng cái chết của Vua Duncan, mở ra triều đại của một hôn quân bạo chúa rồi đây sẽ đạt đến đỉnh điểm của sự tàn sát và cuối cùng là một kết cục đầy bi thảm cho cả hai vợ chồng ông.Nếu như ban đầu, hành động giết người Macbeth thực hiện được tiếp tay và trợ giúp bằng những lời đốc thúc từ vợ mình, trước đó là những lời tiên tri khơi gợi tham vọng quyền lực từ ba chị em phù thủy, thì ở giai đoạn sau, khi Macbeth đã xưng vương ở Scotland, khát khao loại bỏ những đối thủ có nguy cơ cướp lấy ngai vàng của ông được thổi bùng lên bằng chính sự điên loạn đến mờ mắt của chính ông - kẻ đã nhúng chàm với đôi bàn tay vấy máu không cách gì rửa sạch được. Hành động giết chết Vua Duncan dường như đã châm ngòi cho cái ác bên trong Macbeth được trỗi dậy. Ông tự động đề ra kế hoạch ám sát Banquo - người được ba chị em phù thủy tiên đoán là sẽ không trở thành vua, nhưng sẽ là tổ tiên của những đời vua Scotland tiếp theo - và Fleance, con trai Banquo. Diệt cỏ thì phải diệt tận gốc, đã phóng lao thì phải theo lao, và Macbeth đã quyết tâm làm đúng như thế. Duy chỉ có điều là Banquo chết nhưng Fleance thì sống (và hậu duệ của cậu bé sẽ gầy dựng nên nhà Stuart của Scotland).Sau đó, để gạt bỏ mọi sự hậu thuẫn mà Malcolm - người lẽ ra đã là Vua của Scotland nếu không bỏ trốn - có được, Macbeth còn rắp tâm hại chết Macduff - vị Lãnh chúa quyết tâm lật đổ triều đại của vị hôn quân với những âm mưu giết chóc này. Và khi không hại được Macduff, Macbeth ra lệnh tàn sát toàn bộ gia đình Macduff, bao gồm vợ của ông và những đứa con. Tham vọng quyền lực, cái ác, sự điên cuồng, máu, hành vi giết người, tất cả hòa quyện vào nhau trong cái chất siêu nhiên được Shakespeare thổi vào vở kịch, đầu tiên là với sự xuất hiện của phù thủy, những lời tiên tri, sau đó là hồn ma của Banquo và những vị vua Scotland trước đó. Hồn ma ấy không chỉ ám ảnh Macbeth, mà sau này còn ám tới Lady Macbeth, người cuối cùng đã phải trả giá cho tham vọng quyền lực bất chấp đạo lý của mình. Bà luôn nhìn thấy trước mắt những tội lỗi mà bà cùng chồng đã gây ra, luôn ngửi thấy mùi máu tanh trên đôi tay mình dù chúng được tẩy rửa sạch sẽ - thứ mùi tanh mà không có loại dầu thơm nào có thể gột sạch được. Và cuối cùng, bà qua đời trong sự điên loạn cùng những ảo giác cứ diễu đi diễu lại trước mắt bà - một cái chết nửa phần là tự nhiên, nửa phần là do tự sát; bà đã tự kết liễu bản thân mình vào cái lúc bà quyết định thúc đẩy chồng đi vào con đường giết chóc để đoạt lấy hoàng vị.Trong một chừng mực nào đó, anh hùng của vở kịch chính là Macbeth, người không từ một thủ đoạn nào, một hành động nào để giành lấy và duy trì ngôi vua của mình. Với nghệ thuật miêu tả tâm lý nhân vật rất lôi cuốn và ám ảnh đến đáng sợ, Shakespeare đã cho thấy một Macbeth vẫy vùng và chiến đấu tới cùng vì mục tiêu mình đặt ra, dù mục tiêu ấy có sai lầm đến mức nào. Mở đầu vở kịch, ông là kẻ yếu thế, đứa em họ của nhà vua được ban thưởng nhờ công lao của ông trong cuộc chiến với Na Uy bằng tước vị Thane of Cawdor, chỉ vì người nắm giữ tước vị đó là kẻ phản vua và cần phải được trừng trị. Cuối vở kịch, ông là cựu vương của Scotland, kẻ đã sống và hành động để hiện thực hóa mong muốn được làm vua của mình, để rồi cuối cùng bị bao vây bởi cánh rừng Birnam đã di chuyển về Dunsinane (mà thực ra là đoàn quân của Malcolm được ngụy trang) và sau đó chết dưới tay Macduff - người không được sinh ra bởi một người phụ nữ, mà là được giật ra khỏi tử cung của bà ấy (theo hình thức đẻ mổ). Và vì lẽ đó, bi kịch của Macbeth và vợ ông mang chất người vô cùng - những con người bị mắc kẹt và đày đọa bởi chính tham vọng và mục tiêu sai lạc của mình, cố gắng chiến đấu để trở thành những người chiến thắng, nhưng cuối cùng không thể nào chối bỏ được bản chất quyền lực của họ, thứ quyền lực đạt được nhờ giết chóc và cưỡng đoạt.Không nên đọc “Macbeth” như thể là một câu chuyện ngụ ngôn về đạo đức và đạo lý làm người (hoặc làm vua), bởi Shakespeare không xây dựng Macbeth và vợ ông là những người ác độc máu lạnh hoàn toàn, còn Malcolm và Macduff là những người hoàn toàn ở bên phe thiện. Khi thử thách lòng trung thành của Macduff với mục tiêu lật đổ vị hôn quân Macbeth cùng những gì xấu xa ghê tởm được cổ súy bởi triều đại này, Malcolm đã nói dối một cách trắng trợn bằng cách vẽ nên những tính xấu của mình, thứ khiến anh ta cũng hoàn toàn không phù hợp để làm Vua của Scotland: ham muốn tình dục và những thú vui xác thịt (được Malcolm miêu tả là bao nhiêu phụ nữ cũng không thể thỏa mãn anh ta), lòng tham không đáy với đất đai của các vị quý tộc. Macduff ban đầu dễ dàng bỏ qua những tính xấu đó của Malcolm, mặc dù đó chính là những tính xấu đã khiến biết bao đời vua lụn bại, chỉ vì Malcolm rõ ràng là người thừa kế hợp pháp ngai vàng Scotland sau khi Vua Duncan qua đời và là người đang cùng chí hướng với mình. Chỉ khi Macduff không thể chịu đựng được nữa sự miêu tả khủng khiếp của Malcolm về bản thân anh ta, ông mới lên tiếng phản đối và điều này giúp Malcolm nhận ra Macduff hoàn toàn một lòng trung thành với sự nghiệp loại bỏ tên vua xấu xa Macbeth. Malcolm ngay lập sửa lại những hình dung về bản thân mà anh ta đã tạo ra trong tâm trí Macduff bằng cách nói ngược lại hoàn toàn những gì anh đã tuyên bố trước đó, vẽ nên một hình ảnh Malcolm hoàn hảo đến mức khó tin và không thể nào là sự thật. Khán giả sẽ vô cùng phân vân không biết phiên bản Malcolm nào mới thực sự là Malcolm - vị vua tương lai, lời nói nào của Malcolm mới thực sự miêu tả bản chất của anh ta? Hay anh ta sẽ lại là một hôn quân bạo chúa như Macbeth? Bản thân Macduff cũng là một nhân vật mang nhiều khía cạnh đáng bàn. Trái ngược với Macbeth - người đã đánh giá quá cao vai trò và sự tham vấn của phụ nữ (đầu tiên là ba chị em phù thủy, sau đó là tới người vợ Lady Macbeth) dẫn đến tử huyệt của chính ông - Macduff lại đánh giá quá thấp vai trò và tình yêu của vợ ông dành cho mình. Ông bỏ vợ con lại Scotland vì nghĩ rằng họ không quan trọng trong chiến lược chiếm giữ ngai vàng của Macbeth. Ấy vậy mà cuối cùng họ chính là người phải hy sinh mạng sống của mình vì ông, vì ông đã không ở đó để bảo vệ họ. (Trong phim thì làm rạch ròi ai tốt ai xấu ra luôn, Macduff ở bên phe “nạn nhân”, đã tính đường cho vợ con đi trốn rồi, nhưng mà giữa đường gia đình ông vẫn bị những kẻ ám sát thuê bởi Macbeth giết hại).Bi kịch trong “Macbeth” mở đầu bằng một cuộc chiến và kết thúc cũng bằng một cuộc chiến đẫm máu khác, với cái đầu của Macbeth nằm trong tay Macduff đang hả hê vì thắng trận, ám chỉ cái vòng luẩn quẩn giết chóc không bao giờ dứt xoay quanh ngai vàng của Scotland. Và hình ảnh Macduff đứng bên cạnh Malcolm - người giờ đây trở thành vua và đòi lại được hoàng vị vốn thuộc về mình - như thể hình ảnh phản chiếu của Macbeth và Duncan trước đó: một bên là vua, một bên là “người lập vua” (the kingmaker), kẻ đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc xưng vương và duy trì hoàng vị của nhà vua, và là người mà vua luôn phải dựa vào. Mà một khi nhà vua phải dựa vào ai thì ông ta sẽ phải chịu sự chi phối của người đó… Cái kết của phim còn đọng lại suy nghĩ nhiều hơn, khi cậu bé Fleance - con trai của Banquo - cầm lấy cây kiếm của Macbeth và đi về phía chiến trường hoang vắng, ngụ ý một tương lai tranh giành hoàng vị bất ổn cho Scotland.(Thực sự mình sẽ không bao giờ ngộ ra được những điều trên nếu chỉ xem phim hoặc nắm diễn biến chính của “Macbeth” mà không chịu khó đọc phần Introduction của tác phẩm. Phải nói là với phần Introduction tỉ mỉ và giới thiệu những góc nhìn mới lạ, cuốn sách đã thực sự giúp mình phát hiện ra những điểm hay ho và thú vị của “Macbeth” mà trước giờ mình không nhận ra ^^ Đọc tác phẩm rồi nhớ lại những đoạn phân tích, diễn dịch trong Introduction mới thấy hợp lý vô cùng :D).Mình đặc biệt ngưỡng mộ cái nhìn đi trước thời đại của William Shakespeare ở tác phẩm này, khi ông đã xây dựng nên một Lady Macbeth vượt ra khỏi mọi khuôn khổ trói buộc vai trò của người phụ nữ. Ở thời đại mà phụ nữ chỉ có thể là những người nhún nhường, một lòng một dạ phục vụ chồng con và không có sự lựa chọn nào khác ngoài chuyện trở thành những người vợ người mẹ, Lady Macbeth vượt trội hơn tất thảy vì bà dám khát khao quyền lực và mang tham vọng được làm bá chủ Scotland cùng chồng mình. Bà hiểu thành công của người phụ nữ chính là thành công của người đàn ông mà họ được gắn kết bởi máu mủ ruột thịt hay hôn nhân, và vì thế bà đã làm tất cả để chồng mình phải đấu tranh giành lấy ngai vàng, dù cuộc chiến họ dấn thân vào là một cuộc chiến vô nghĩa (hoàng vị hoàn toàn không thuộc về Macbeth, ông tin như thế chỉ dựa vào lời tiên tri của ba mụ phù thủy. Vì thế những đấu tranh của ông cũng hoàn toàn vô nghĩa, vì ông đấu tranh cho thứ ngay từ đầu đã không phải của ông). Dù cách thức để đoạt được hoàng vị đó hoàn toàn sai lạc và đi ngược lại đạo lý làm người, Lady Macbeth vẫn không hề suy suyển trong quyết định thúc ép chồng mình giết Vua Duncan; có thể xem bà là nhà lãnh đạo của Macbeth, hoặc có thể đơn giản bà chỉ là người vợ bị mờ mắt bởi quyền lực được hứa hẹn và mở miệng xúi dại chồng. Nhưng dù vai trò của bà trong tấn bi kịch này có như thế nào, thì lẽ ra Macbeth đã không ra tay giết vua nếu không phải vì nghe theo lời bà tham vấn. Trong tình thế không có vũ khí hay quyền lực như những người đàn ông, Lady Macbeth đã dùng tới lời nói của một người vợ - vai trò chính mà xã hội thời xưa gán cho bà - để chi phối và thay đổi thời cuộc. Quả thực là bái phục, mặc dù cái thời cuộc bà tạo ra thật là khủng khiếp và kinh hoàng… Hashtag girlpower :DMà chắc cũng từ tác phẩm này mà cụm từ “Lady Macbeth” thường được dùng để chỉ những người phụ nữ tác động xấu lên người đàn ông mình yêu và gây nên bi kịch cho cả hai người (giống như VN mình dùng từ Hoạn Thư để chỉ phụ nữ hay ghen, Sở Khanh để chỉ mấy thằng đàn ông khốn nạn phụ tình, Tú Bà để chỉ mấy bà dắt gái mại dâm ý). Đơn cử tác giả người Nga Nikolai Leskov có viết một cuốn tiểu thuyết ngắn lấy nhan đề Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, nhân vật chính cũng là một người phụ nữ mạnh mẽ, tham vọng và có khả năng chi phối lớn, đã lên kế hoạch giết người và lôi kéo người đàn ông mình yêu cùng tham gia, dẫn đến bi kịch cho cả hai.

2995380634	Debo admitir que los primeros dos actos me resultaron un poco difíciles, no lograban engancharme del todo. Pero una vez dentro del tercer acto, la cosa va tomando ritmo y no desciende en ningún momento. La manera en que Shakespeare relata el descenso a la locura de Macbeth me resultó fascinante, y ni hablar de aquel miedo disfrazado de orgullo, opacado por la avaricia, influenciado por el loco amor de Lady Macbeth. La única razón por la cuál no he podido darle cinco estrellas es por el primer problema que señale arriba. De ahí en fuera, es una excelente lectura.

Macbeth è tormentato inizialmente, in seguito perde completamente il senno e questo sviluppo, questa crescita, mi piace da impazzire. Ora devo assolutamente rivedere il film con Fassbender 💜

1362539767	Para empezar diré que no siendo un fan de Shakespeare pues me desilusionó con algunas obras, encontré que Macbeth era aún superior a lo que había escuchado. Recuerdo que alguna vez leí que era una muy buena obra, y para mí en lo personal no me llama la atención tanto ni del rey, o de la esposa de Macbeth y su ambición sin límites, ni las brujas que aparecen y son algo novedoso en el teatro de esa época; sino más bien la tremenda resolución de Macbeth cuando toma como dictador las riendas del estado y posteriormente su gran valentía ante su trágico destino, incluso sabiendo ya lo que estaba escrito sobre sí mismo.Cada vez que recuerdo Macbeth me viene a la mente la ambición negra pero también el arrojo sin límites.En mi opinión es la mejor tragedia de Shakespeare.
1284821784	No me decepcionó, pero tampoco superó mis expectativas. Luego de haber tenido este libro en mi biblioteca por años, me animé a leerlo. Ya sabía superficialmente de qué trataba Macbeth, pero no lo conocía tan en profundidad. Me costó entrar en la historia al principio, pero llegando a la mitad de la obra me fui interesando más y más sin darme cuenta. Teniendo en cuenta que la literatura teatral no es para mí, eso es gran mérito. La verdad no sé qué destacar del libro, salvo las brujas que se robaron la película (o la obra), sobre todo con los ingredientes que necesitaban, y aparecían en distintas partes de la obra. Buen libro, sobre todo para ser litertura teatral.
1184997528	صد نمایشنامه (۲) | مکبث از ویلیام شکسپیریک دهه‌ی قبلی زندگی من به نفرین و مسخره کردن شکسپیر گذشت. تقریبا به چشم یه تفریح سالم بهش نگاه می‌کردم، چون بیشتر آدمایی هم که اطرافم بودن و در مورد شکسپیر حرف می‌زدیم، نمی‌تونستن بگن چرا کار ایشون نویسنده‌ی خوبی هستن. من نمی‌دونستم، اونا هم نمی‌دونستن، بد و بی‌راه گفتن پشت سر مرده هم معمولا عیبی نداره. پس منم کم نمی‌ذاشتم. اما خب جدیدا فهمیدم دقیقا باید به چی دقت کنم تا ارزش شکسپیر رو متوجه بشم، مطمئنم که این مسئله‌ای که من بهش توجه می‌کنم بخش کوچیکی از قضیه‌س و خیلی چیزهای مهم‌تری هم هست. اما به هر حال فقط در مورد چیزایی که می‌دونم می‌تونم صحبت کنم. مکبث یکی از شخصیت‌های خبیث تاریخ ادبیات به حساب میاد. کسی که پادشاهش رو می‌کشه، به قول‌هایی که داده خیانت می‌کنه، زن و بچه‌های بی‌گناه بقیه رو نابود می‌کنه و... خلاصه که توی مزخرف بودن کم نمی‌ذاره و شکسپیر هم بارها از زبان خود مکبث و اطرافیانش اون رو تخریب می‌کنه. اما مسئله اینه که به نظرم شکسپیر مکبث رو انسان بدی نمی‌دونه، صرفا اون رو به عنوان کسی که گمراه شده و تصمیم اشتباهی گرفته معرفی می‌کنه. برای درک بهترش این مثال رو داریم:صحنه‌ی اول از پرده‌ی اول مکبث، هر سه جادوگر در آخر صحنه می‌گن: پاک پلید است و پلید پاک. یعنی هر چیزی که برای بقیه پاکه، برای ما پلیده و هر چیزی برای بقیه پلیده، برای ما پاکه. حالا بریم جلوتر، صحنه‌ی اول از پرده‌ی چهارم، جادوگر دوم پیش از ورود مکبث می‌گه: چیز منحوسی به این طرف می‌آید. با توجه به اینکه جادوگرها به عنوان کسایی که از آشکار و نهان خبردار هستن معرفی می‌شن، می‌تونیم ببینیم که اون‌ها مکبث رو منحوس و پلید می‌دونن. پس در اصل مکبث انسانِ پلیدی به حساب نمیاد، وگرنه جادوگرها احتمالا خوش‌حال می‌شدن از دیدنش. قضیه‌ی مکبث، اولین نمایشنامه‌ی شکسپیر که با دقت می‌خونم، دقیقا در مورد جزئیاته. اشتباهه که به جملات دقت کنیم، در حالی که بخش بزرگی از معانی توی کلماتن. شکسپیر روی کوچک‌ترین اجزای متنش با دقت کار کردن، مسائلی رو گذاشته که معنی نمایشنامه رو بهتر نشون می‌دن. مکبث در مورد یک فقدان و بهم خوردن تعادله. اسکاتلند با اینکه درگیر جنگ با نروژ و ایرلنده، باز هم به خاطر داشتن پادشاهی که توسط "خدا" انتخاب شده، تعادل داره. جادوگرها میان و با پیش‌بینیشون (که ممکن هم هست دروغ باشه، جز لیدی مکبث هیچ کس اونقدر هم بهشون اعتماد نداره.) این تعادل رو بهم می‌ریزن. مکبث ذاتا خون‌خواره، حتی به راحتی می‌تونم تصور کنم رفتارش توی جنگ شبیه یک موجود وحشیه. با این حال کسی نیست که بی‌دلیل و برای خودخواهی کسی رو بکشه، مخصوصا پادشاهی که همه اعتقاد دارن مثل فرشته‌ای معصومه. داستان مکبث در مورد فقدان دنکنه. پادشاهی که شاید برای حکومت کردن هم چندان مناسب نیست، اما باعث می‌شه مکبث، کسی که احتمالا پادشاه بهتریه، سلامت روان خودش رو از دست بده. اهمیت از دست دادن سلامت روان هم خیلی مهمه، اون دوره کسایی که جنون داشتن رو همراه با جادوگرها و پیرزن‌های زشت (نمیدونم چرا) اعدام می‌کردن، کسی زحمت نمی‌کشید که سعی کنه درمانشون کنه. اشاره‌ی مستقیمی به این قضیه توی داستان داریم، جایی که طبیب در مورد لیدی مکبث می‌گه که اون بیشتر از طبیب، به کشیش نیاز داره. این قضیه کاملا در مورد مکبث هم صدق می‌کنه. مکبث کلِ داستان با چیزهایی که وجود ندارن می‌جنگه، روح کسانی که به ناحق کشته و خونی که روی دست‌هاشه. بخش بزرگی از دیالوگ‌های مکبث توی پرده‌ی دوم و سوم، تلاش اون برای راضی کردن خودشه. مثل اینکه درونش دوتا پادشاه هستن، یکی که از تاریکی می‌ترسه و نمی‌خوابه، چون که خواب برای اون شبیه به مرگه و از مرگ می‌ترسه؛ این مکبث به همه بی‌اعتماده و اینقدر درون مرگ فرو می‌ره که برای اون بی‌معنی می‌شه، حتی از خبرِ مرگ لیدی مکبث حتی ناراحت هم نمی‌شه. و یک مکبث دیگری هم هست، اون حتی از اولی هم مجنون‌تره، بیش از حد احمقه برای دیدن واقعیت‌ها. به سه جادوگر و هکاته اعتماد داره، خیال می‌کنه کسیه که از سمت خدا انتخاب شده، جاودانه‌س و چیزی ورای مرگ، تعهد و احساساتِ انسانیه. از اون سمت مکدف رو داریم، کسی که مشخصا سعی می‌کنه احساساتش رو آزاد کنه، عزاداری و ناراحتی رو چیزی جدا از مردانگی نمی‌دونه.در کل حس می‌کنم بهتره چند ماه دیگه دوباره برگردم و مکبث رو بخونم، بار اول اینقدر بعضی از صحنه‌ها هیجان‌زده‌م کردن که قطعا خیلی از جزئیات از دستم در رفتن. پ.ن: ترجمه‌ی خانم فرنگیس شادمان از نشر علمی فرهنگی رو خوندم، متن انگلیسی رو هم داشت و به جرئت می‌گم ترجمه‌ی خیلی قدرتمندی بود. همینطور مقدمه‌ی جالبی از آقای دریک تراورسی داشت که خیلی برای فهمیدن مکبث بهم کمک کرد.
4462093024	Reconozco que mis inicios con Shakespeare no fueron tan afortunados como me había esperado. Probablemente pequé al asociar una de las historias más famosas de la literatura con la mejor obra del autor. Ante esta inocente confusión, leí Romeo y Julieta sintiéndome muy alejado de la historia y comprendiendo que el exceso de dramatismo me suele provocar un efecto adverso. Han tenido que pasar tres años para volver a enfrentarme a William Shakespeare, pero la espera indudablemente ha merecido la pena. Ya en sus primeras páginas, cada palabra me ha transportado a un mundo onírico, en el que las sombras y tinieblas florecen por efecto de la deslealtad, la locura y el poder.La obra se inicia con el encuentro del general Macbeth con tres brujas que le auguran un futuro prometedor y lleno de poder. Junto con su mujer, Macbeth comienza a planear todos aquellos eventos que le llevarán al cumplimiento de las profecías, configurando así la psicología de un personaje que se tendrá que enfrentar a sus actos y al debate entre moralidad y justicia.Desde su primera escena, Shakespeare ya muestra sus mejores cartas y expone tanto la belleza de la forma en la que va a expresar sus ideas como los temas y símbolos que se van a desarrollar durante los diferentes actos. Recomiendo encarecidamente una edición bilingüe (o, si es posible, leer la obra en su versión original) para apreciar los extraordinarios juegos de palabras y el uso del lenguaje tan inteligente y audaz que emplea a lo largo de la obra. La introducción de las brujas al universo shakesperiano finaliza con la frase “lo bello es feo y feo lo que es bello” (“fair is foul, and foul is fair”). Esta oración, aparentemente simple, sirve como ejemplo de la musicalidad y la fantástica dicción creada en cada una de las páginas de Macbeth. Además, sintetiza a la perfección el constante debate que se va a plantear: la unión de contrarios, la delgada línea existente entre el bien y el mal, la confusión de términos antagónicos. La obra está plagada de antónimos que realzan la facilidad con la que una misma situación puede generar reacciones opuestas, en función del punto de vista. Con estas cualidades, a través del relato de una tragedia en cinco actos, Shakespeare indaga en el concepto de la identidad, de su pérdida y, especialmente, del miedo a su pérdida. Para ello, recurre a uno de los personajes más extraordinarios jamás creados, Lady Macbeth, la cual fuerza la búsqueda de la identidad en los dos miembros del matrimonio. Poniendo el foco en los atributos masculinos y femeninos, la esposa juega con la identidad de género con el objetivo de justificar cada uno de sus actos. Pero no sólo es Lady Macbeth la que se desarrolla alrededor de este concepto: el propio protagonista está creado y evoluciona con el problema de identidad como eje central. Pese a que pretendan solucionar estas cuestiones mediante ayudas externas e, incluso, sobrenaturales, Shakespeare remarca que los problemas de identidad son mucho más complejos y pueden resultar venenosos cuando se mezclan con las apariencias.Macbeth se convierte así en una obra que prueba la importancia y genialidad del género teatral. Macbeth está hecha para ser declamada, para ser interpretada en los escenarios. Juega con todos los elementos del género y crea un mundo inquietante a medio camino entre el mundo de los vivos y de los muertos. Además, Shakespeare demuestra que era un verdadero mago del léxico, que engrandecía aún más su obra. Macbeth ha resultado ser toda una experiencia, una aventura trágica y sangrienta que demuestra la genialidad de uno de los mejores dramaturgos de todos los tiempos.
5508971375	﻿بله او عاشق شکسپیر بود قبل از جنگ برای اجرای صحنه ای هملت موسیقی نوشته بود. چه کسی میتوانست در این تشکیک کند که شکسپیر درک عمیقی از جان آدمی و وضعیت انسانی دارد؟ آیا هرگز کسی توانسته بهتر از شاه لیر از هم پاشیدن توهمات انسانی را تصویر کند؟ نه از هم پاشیدن تعبیر چندان مناسبی نیست چون بحرانی عظیم و یکباره را القا میکند حال آنکه آنچه در واقع بر سر توهمات انسانی میآید این است که کم کم فرو میریزند و بر باد میروند. فرآیندی فرساینده و طولانی در کار است مثل دندان دردی که به عمق جان آدم نفوذ می‌کند.دندان درد را می‌شود کشید و از شرش خلاص شد،اما توهمات،حتی پس از مرگشان،درون ما فاسد و متعفن می‌شوند.خلاصی از بو و مزه‌ی آن‌ها ممکن نیست.ما تمام مدت آن‌ها را با خود همه‌جا می‌کشیم.برای او که اینطور بود.چطور می‌تواند عاشق شکسپیر نبود؟هرچه باشد،شکسپیر عاشق موسیقی است.نمایشنامه‌هایش،حتی تراژدی هایش،پر از موسیقی‌اند.لحطه‌ای که لیر،با صدای موسیقی،از خواب جنون بیدار می‌شود...یا آن‌جا که در تاجر ونیزی،شکسپیر می‌گوید آن که موسیقی را دوست ندارد شایسته‌ی اعتماد نیست و به هر پلشتی حتی خیانت و جنایت تواناست.پس طبیعتا مستبدان،هرقدر هم مصرانه وانمود کنند عاشق موسیقی‌اند،از آن نفرت دارند.گرچه از شعر بیش‌تر بدشان می‌آید.آرزو می‌کرد کاش در آن جلسه‌ی شعر خوانیِ شاعران لنینگراد حاضر بود،در لحظه‌ای که آخماتوا روی صحنه رفت و همه‌ی حاضران ناخوداگاه برای تشویقش از جا بلند شدند.این حرکت خشم استالین را بر انگیخت.با خشمی آتشین پرسید:«چه کسی از جا بلند شدن حاضران را سازماندهی کرده؟»اما مستبدان از تئاتر حتی بیش از شعر نفرت داشتند.شکسپیر آینه‌ای در برابر طبیعت می‌گرفت و کیست که تحمل دیدن بازتاب خود را داشته باشد.از این رو هملت مدت‌ها ممنوع بود.استالین از هملت تقریبا به اندازه‌ی مکبث بیزار بود.اما شکسپیر به رغم این همه،به رغم بی بدیل بودنش در تصویر کردن مستبدانِ تا زانو در خون فرو رفته،کمی ساده لوح بود،چون هیولاهایش دچار شک و عذاب وجدان و احساس گناه می‌شدند و خواب‌های آشفته می‌دیدند.روح مقتولانشان پیش چشمشان ظاهرمی‌شد.اما در زندگی واقعی،زیر سیطره‌ی وحشت واقعی،وجدان معذب کجا بود؟ خواب آشفته کجا بود؟ این‌ها همه احساساتی گری و خوشبینی کاذب است،امیدی است به این که دنیا آن‌طور باشد که ما دلمان می‌خواهد،نه آن‌طور که واقعا هست.آن‌هایی که پشت میز های کارشان در عمارت بزرگ بلوموری می‌کشیدند،آن‌هایی که پای حکم‌ها را امضا می‌کردند،تلفنی فرمان را می‌دادند و پوشه را_و همراه آن زندگی کسی را_می‌بستند،باری،چند تا از آن‌ها خواب‌های بد می‌دیدند؟ روح مردگان برابر چندتا از آن‌ها ظاهر می‌شد تا شماتتشان کند؟Julian Barnes/The Noise of Time
857694396	"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,To the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!" i have no idea how to even begin to review this absolute masterpiece. definitely my favourite of shakespeare's, although that may change when i read hamlet, we shall see (i've seen it performed but not read it) as i said in my updates, i've always thought the presence of the witches and the cadence of the dialogue give macbeth the aura of a nightmare fairy tale, like a fairy tale of the unseelie court. the winter's tale seems to be its rectification, a play that ends in tragedy but ends with (mostly) happiness, with faint allusions to the supernatural woven in (not nearly so much as macbeth, possibly because "unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles" and the winter's tale ends on the resolution of troubles rather than their culmination.) this is turning into a mini, rather incoherent ramble about how much i love shakespeare and the possible interlinking of plays so i'd better conclude it now before veer too much off topic, lol.
