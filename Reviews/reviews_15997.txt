124385524	There's all this debate over why Satan is so appealing in Paradise Lost. Did Milton screw up? Is he being cynical, or a double-secret atheist? And why is God such a dick?But no one asks whether, say, Shakespeare screwed up in making Iago so much fun; they just give him credit for writing an awesome villain. And that's all Milton's doing. Satan is tempting for us because Satan is tempting for us. That's the point of Satan! If Milton didn't make him as appealing as possible, he'd be doing Satan a disservice. And Eve, for that matter.Similarly, God's a dick because God's a dick. You've read the Old Testament. He's not exactly all flowers and hugs there either. Again, Milton's just being true to his characters, and writing a great story while he's at it. There’s slightly more to it than that, yeah. For example: it's hinted a little that God sets Satan up to fall. He gives a stern warning that anyone who disobeys him or his son will be cast out of Heaven. But since there's no sin or evil at the time of his speech, why give the warning? Isn't that like saying "Don't touch these cookies while I'm gone" to a kid who didn't realize there were cookies until you pointed them out?Here’s my advice to people considering reading Paradise Lost: read the first two books. It starts with a bang, and it’s pretty amazing for a while. It slows down a bit in books III - VII, so if you’re not totally sold in the first two books (I was), you can either quit altogether with a fair idea of what Milton sounds like, or skip to books IX and X. IX is the actual temptation and fall (especially fun if you’re a misogynist), and X is an astonishing sequence where Adam and Eve contemplate suicide:"Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out To deathless pain? How gladly would I meetMortality my sentence...his dreadful voice no moreWould thunder in my ears." (Adam, X.774 - 780)“We’ve totally mucked this up, and our kids are gonna justifiably hate us because we got kicked out of Paradise, and maybe we should just quit while we’re behind.”But really, the whole thing is worth it. Took me a while – it’s intense stuff, so I found that I had to read a book and then chew on it for a while to process it before moving to the next one – but it’s cool.In book VIII, if you’re cosmologically minded, Milton lays out the whole universe. Like Giordano Bruno, he understands that our earth is a tiny speck in the universe, and he gets that all the stars are suns like ours, and therefore could have planets like ours around them. He also thinks they might be inhabited; our species might not be God's only experiment. Elsewhere, other Adams and Eves may have faced the same test of the Tree of Knowledge - and they might have passed it. Isn't that an amazing thought?In books XI and XII, Michael tells Adam sortof all the rest of the stories in the Old Testament, which of course boil down to:“So shall the world go on,To good malignant, to bad men benign,Under her own weight groaning.” (XII 537 – 539)That’s your fault there, Adam. Nice work.He rushes through them though, and it makes me wonder whether Milton had originally intended to retell the entire Old Testament but got bored or intimidated or something. That would’ve been remarkable. Certainly Paradise Lost is better literature than the Old Testament is, and significantly more coherent.It's also better literature than almost everything else. Second-best poem by a blind guy ever.
2231107	in middle school i had seen this book lying around the house and for some reason it struck me as very impressive. i didn't ever want to read it but i wanted to give off the impression that i was the type of person who would read it. i did this with a few other books too (catcher in the rye, on the road, ect.) i carried it to school so that teachers would see it in my possession and prominently displayed it on my bedside table to let friends and family know. after actually reading the book for a brit-lit class i realized how wrong my thirteen-year-old self was with the image i assumed i was portraying. most likely people realized that i was desperate for attention and for some strange reason was using john milton to get it, but on the off chance they did believe i was 'into' paradise lost, i must have seemed like a total psycho. the book is about a war waged in hell after satan's fall into the underworld. all of the descriptions are completely graphic and grotesque. i think i blocked a lot out but i do remember a female demon who is repeatedly raped by her sons immediately after giving birth to them. yuck. thank god i realized later that the best way to get attention is through cigarettes and promiscuity not literature.
4379303015	Has a book ever gently nudged its way onto your path? Or maybe incessantly kept knocking on the door of your life?My favorite author kept saying how Paradise Lost by John Milton had such a profound impact on his life. Yeah yeah yeah. Then, when I came into The Archive bookstore, I saw a gorgeous copy of Paradise Lost from 1855 sitting on the shelf. A beautiful red book with the most intricate and breath-taking gold inlay, of a quality that no longer exists. The only problem--a chunk of the spine was dangling by a thread. So I didn't buy it. For years, I kept my eye on this book. It called to me every time I was in the shop. Until one day, The Archive bookstore announced its closing. Everything was 50% off, and it was now or never. I couldn't leave my friend on the shelf any longer.Of course, as if by magic, I just so happened to know of a library who has a person skilled at repairing books, and I asked if it wouldn't be too much trouble if he could glue the spine back together. After 169 years, this book is back in its former state of glory, in the adoring hands of a book lover.

2200255916	Paradise Lost is the quintessential epic poem and its protagonist, Satan, is the quintessential anti-hero. “Better to reign in Hell, than to serve in Heaven.” It’s almost impossible to read this without, in some way, sympathising with him. Although he is vain, full of pride and evil, he is still a fallen angel. And that’s kind of important. In the early cantos he is powerful, persuasive and godly though he, ultimately, becomes corrupted by his own selfish desires and ruins himself. He is blinded by ambition and God’s glory. He is jealous and power hungry and reals over what he will never have. He deteriorates and festers, becoming more evil as his pain increases. The hell he feels at his separation from God is projected outwards and he looses himself in maelstrom of emotions that inflict his soul. He lives in denial and becomes demented that much so he is reduced to the form of a snake. The once magnificent angel, tall and proud, now slithers on the floor with the beasts. Satan is fearless. Eternal damnation did not make him baulk. As a form of petty revenge for his perpetual banishment from heaven, Satan determines to corrupt mankind and prove that God’s creation is fallible, weak and debased. He creates Sin and Death, his children, the means of entering Earth through hell. Through temptation he has his victory, Eve eats the apple in the garden of eden because of his coercion. God punishes Adam and Eve, banishing them to Earth. Satan has achieved his goal, though his fate remains unchanged and his once noble intentions have become so distorted that he becomes the very personification of evil. “Abashed the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is and saw Virtue in her shape how lovely: and pined his loss” The poem interprets the idea of salvation and redemption present in the bible. Despite his crimes, Satan never attempts a reconciliation. Humanity, on the other hand, toils on earth, worships god, and seeks forgiveness. It displays the idea that obedience to God is the creed in which one should live by and that all hierarchies exist for a reason, to break them is to break the rule of God. As such, some critics see political arguments within the text, arguing that Satan represents Oliver Cromwell, the usurper, and that God represent Charles I, the lord and king of the lands. It’s an interesting reading, for sure. Like all great poetry, Paradise Lost can be read in many different ways. The religious allegory and imagery is excellent. There’s so much to say about this poem, and it has influenced so many other writers in the centuries after its original publication. I wonder how much so though. I can think of numerous examples in modern literature that would not have existed if not for the influence and pertinence of the ideas presented here. Putting aside the beauty of the poetry, and the allegories, it's a fantastic story that has permeated so many others: it's legacy endures. It’s a powerful piece, and the tragic story of Satan will always remain the most endearing aspect of it for me.Blog | Twitter | Facebook | Insta | Academia
781961	Portions of this book were assigned for my Brit Lit class. I read about half of the assigned portions. I was distracted at the time by various events in life and wasn't yet a very good student. My professor had done his PhD work on Milton and taught with a contagious passion. So much passion that I decided, after the discussion was over, to buy the whole book. During our five day Fall break in my sophomore year I sat on the front lawn of my college and read Paradise Lost. Nonstop, getting up for meals and other important breaks but otherwise spending that whole break reading Milton. Hardly anyone else remained on campus. The weather was cool and breezy and beautiful. I sat under a tree and read lengthy portions out loud, which helped me get into the rhythm. Once in the rhythm of reading I tasted heaven itself. This book was an awakening for me, a trigger that opened up my soul and allowed me to understand a small portion of eternity. It was an epiphany weekend for me, one which transformed my soul, and remains in many ways an anchor for my faith. During the dark times of my soul I remembered those days and knew, knew, knew there was something to still hope for. This is a hard read and one that likely requires a lot of space, quiet and time. It takes a while to get into his rhythm and finally dance with his words, but if you can, if you can get away from this world for a while and devote yourself to Milton's work you'll find a new reality opening up. The man saw heaven. The man knew God. His writing is genius and extraordinary, far beyond anything else I've ever read. This book, literally, changed my soul and my life.
1186891033	EDIT 26/12/2018: I'm not answering comments on this review anymore because I find that I have to constantly repeat myself. If you feel the need to point out Paradise Lost is a classic and was written during an era when women had few rights, please refer to the comment section. I'm fucking done. The 50-word review that launched a thousand trolls:Fuck your misogyny. Fuck your scorning Greek gods as false gods, then using its mythology left and right as metaphors. Fuck your punishing the serpent when You knew it was possessed by Satan. Fuck—Ah, forget it.
308631144	Milton wrote this while blind, and claimed it was the result of divine inspiration which visited him nightly. There are few texts that could reasonably be added into the Bible, and this is certainly one of them (the Divine Comedy is another). Paradise Lost outlines portions of the Bible which, thanks to its haphazard combination of mythic stories, are never fully explored. In fact, most of Paradise Lost has become tacitly accepted into the Christian mythos, even if most Christians do not recognize it as a source. It also updated not only the epic, but the heroic form, and its questioning of the devil is a great philosophical exploration, even if it may ultimately prove a failure, as I shall try to explain.The question remains: even if the Vatican did not explicitly include it, why are there not smaller sects which so often spring up around such and inspiring and daring work? The answer is that one need not explicitly include something that has been included implicitly. Many readers accept Milton's view of events as accurate and that it was wholly derived from the Bible, when in fact, it is largely an original work.Under Constantine, Hell and the Devil were re-conceptualized. The representation of Hell in the Bible is often metaphorical, and does not include 'fire and brimstone'. Hell is defined as 'absence from God' and nothing more. This is supposed to be a painful and unfulfilling experience, but not literal physical torture. Much of the modern conceptualization of Hell is based upon Hellenic mythological influences and verses from Revelation taken out of context. The place of 'fire and brimstone' is where the Devil and the Antichrist are put after the apocalypse, and is never stated as being related to human afterlife.Likewise, the Devil is most commonly depicted as a greedy idiot chasing after farts. The only tempting he ever does Biblically is during Job, where he must first ask God if he is permitted to interfere. The concept of the Devil as a charming, rebellious trickster and genius is entirely Milton.He portrays him this way to align Satan with the heroic figures of Epic Poetry. This is not because he thinks of the Devil as a hero, but rather so he can show that our heroes should not be rebellious murderers as they were in ancient stories, but humble, pious, simple men.He gives the Devil philosophical and political motivations for rebelling, but has him fail to notice that God cannot be questioned or defeated. However, this requires that one absolutely believe this assertion without ever testing it. Anyone who accepts it unquestioningly (such as C.S. Lewis) is bound to believe that the Devil is foolish to question the natural order.However, Milton himself states that the Devil had no choice but to doubt, and due to our own rational minds, man cannot help doubting either. In this case, we might fall in with Blake, and suggest that Milton was the Devil's man, not because he wanted to be, but because he carried biblical rhetoric to its rational conclusion.This is illustrated in a rather shocking way in the creation of Eve: finding herself, utterly new to the world, she sees her own reflection in a puddle and, finding it beautiful, leans down naively and tries to kiss it. This amusing retelling of the myth of Narcissus indicates that God made women naturally autoerotic and bisexual.Sadly, this never made it into modern Christianity, for some reason, but it does show the strength of Paradise Lost: Milton provides rhetorical support for every idea he explores, even those he did not side with. It is a great book of questions, and a book which demands the reader think and try to understand.We are supposed to sympathize with the Devil because he is heroic and dangerous, but we also know he is the Devil. We know that to sympathize with him is wrong, and that he is supposed to be wrong. Milton here invented the concept of the Devil we cannot help but sympathize with, and who we must fight daily to overcome.He defined sin as doubt, but without realizing that doubt will always deconstruct an old answer and suggest a new one. The fact remains that metaphysically, doubt can only injure us in a realm we cannot know exists. As the enemy of any tyranny--of men, of ideas--doubt is the helpmeet of all who struggle. The Devil is the father of doubt, and the final outcome of doubt is always accepting that we are fundamentally ignorant: either in our believing, or in our not believing.He also uses the English language in an entirely idiomatic and masterful way, his is one of the few unique voices of English. Reading him sometimes proves a challenge for those without a background in Latin, since his sentence structure and particularly his verb use are stripped-down and multipurpose, taking the form of metaphysical poets to its logical conclusion.He is also one of the most knowledgeable and allusive of writers, especially when it comes to the longer form. His encyclopedic exploration of myths, reinvention of scenes, and adoption of ideas make this work one of the most wide-reaching and interconnected in English.This can make his work somewhat daunting for readers, who are often unwilling to read the books he references in preparation for tackling him, which I find rather ironic, since no one complains about having to read ten-thousand pages of Harry Potter before tackling the last book.

1749575604	Book Review 3.5 out of 5 stars for Paradise Lost, the first of a two-book series, written in 1667 by John Milton. I've only read the first book in this series, but would like to read the second piece at some point. These are epic poems telling of the battle between Satan and God for control over the human soul. It's truly an introspective piece, as I believe Milton threw so much of himself, as well as people in general, into this work. It's captured the attention of so many people, and not just readers. It's the foundation of several films and television adaptions. Some argue it loses focus on the religious aspects; others praise it for being very open to different experiences. It's the kind of literature that pushes you to think about voice and characters. About different sides to a story and alternative opinions. How does it feel to agree with Satan? Do you accept being disappointed in something God says because it's something you thought was OK to do? So much in the words, but also the message is even more powerful. It's a lot to digest, but if you haven't read it, look up a few passages to see if the lyrical tone is something you can absorb while reading the words. It may help give you some perspective on different aspects of life and death. About Me For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

570499943	Next to Shakespeare, Milton's Paradise Lost is probably one of the best and most enduring of the English Classics.That's surprising, really, because, let's face it: not to many people in the modern crowd reads poetry these days. Or they don't try because they assume it's going to be too difficult.Of course, they're probably not trying Milton. It's not only easy to read and gorgeously crafted, but it's also FULL of action, full of thrills, and it just plain kicks ass. Don't let the topic fool you. It may have to do with the fall of Satan and then the fall of Adam and Eve, but Milton is a rockstar of the literature world. We jump right into the thick of the fall of all the rebellious angels right after an epic war in heaven.Not only is Milton courageous enough to make Satan sympathetic and he's never once referred to as "evil", but he makes Satan even persuade ME. Make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven, indeed. We get the epic battle in heaven. We get all the dark and disturbing reasons for the rebellion. We get the jealousy, the sense of injustice, and we get it again when the same kind of predestined plot hits humanity.So many of the darkest questions are explored. And this isn't a simple epic poem. It's not all flowery language, but it IS that at its best moments. It's intense and it's fantastically rich with mythology and history and scholarship -- as you might expect -- but more than that, it's just plain GOOD.It's classic in the sense that it will never go out of style. It's good in a way that when we read it now, it is like the best of our modern fiction. Great stylistic and plot devices, fantastic characterization, and depth. Of course, when I first read this, I was in college and we were required to read the bible to get all the great references and compare the differences, and I DO recommend that if only for comparative analysis in literature, but it's not necessary.This is an action movie. :)
2050343305	I still have my old grad school copy of this work, earnestly annotated with references to Ovid and Homer and (once) Terminator 2. But through all that Milton's words shine forth, depicting the struggle between good and evil, which is a struggle precisely because Satan is so alluring and interesting (by far the most interesting character here, which of course didn't escape the notice of later Romantic writers who were themselves drawn to the anti-hero). But the struggle isn't just between mythic forces, but within the human heart itself, which is what gives the work its under-girding of tender sadness--like the outcry of the "Portress of Hell Gate," who laments in Book II: "Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem / Now in thine eye so foul, once deemed so fair / In Heav'n...." It's a tale of loss (obviously) and jealousy and narcissism (cue the Ovid references) and it's really quite unexpectedly heart-breaking at times, though I'll admit the poetry can be dense and difficult and full of allusions, which is perhaps why it didn't become a "classic" until a few decades after publication when someone produced an annotated version. Still, this is a work that can be enjoyed on its own terms--a self-consciously grand epic.

443841570	In poetic genius, Milton is the only English poet who could seriously rival Shakespeare. As they both were from around the same time period, they use similar language; but in style and substance, the two are worlds apart. Shakespeare has his feet firmly planted in human affairs—he can find the whole universe in a conversation on a lazy afternoon. Milton is epic in scale, taking the reader from the pit of Hell, through unformed Chaos, past Earth, all the way up to Heaven. Shakespeare’s mind travels through the world like a phantom, imbuing it with his own spirit, becoming everything at once but remaining himself nonetheless. Milton, by contrast, gathers the world into himself, melts it down, and reforges it anew.This is one of the few books that repelled me on my first attempt. I was simply unprepared for the style of English, and I had too little reading experience to properly understand the many classical and Biblical references. On my second attempt, I did manage to finish the poem, though it was quite a slog. Nonetheless, many sections made a lasting impression on me, and I often found myself reminiscing about the poem.I have just completed my second journey through this book. Every time I go over a line in this epic, it yields more fruit. The poem is simply beautiful. When attempting to articulate exactly why I love it so much, my words fail me, and I am left with that over-used cliché, "beautiful," but so it goes. I usually abhor re-reading books, but I anticipate reading Paradise Lost many times during my lifetime. Part of why the poem is so compelling is Milton's portrayal of Lucifer. For those who wish to experience perhaps the best tragic character ever conceived—rivaling Oedipus, Faust, Hamlet, Captain Ahab, and King Lear—read this book. Unlike Dante, whose Satan is a dumb, savage brute, Milton's Satan is exquisitely human. The universe of Paradise Lost is not carved up into unambiguous Good vs. unambiguous Evil; it is, instead, a far more subtle, psychological realm of sin, disobedience, rebellion, lust, ambition, and folly. Satan is not evil, but ambitious to the point of insanity. And who could not identify with that?But be warned: this book is difficult. Milton is one of the most educated writers of all time; his learning was vast and deep. The language, dense; the allusions, many; the journey, nigh endless. But it is one that you will remember fondly. In Milton's own words: “Long is the way, and hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.” And, when it is over, you will perhaps find that the journey was a paradise.And when you put the book down, you may mourn that your happy journey through Milton's epic has come to an end. But be not sad. For the poem will live on within the chambers of your mind, and "Thou shalt possess a Paradise within thee, happier far."

13462880	I hope no fan of Milton ever reads this review. And if you are a fan of Milton, go find one of many other reviews that will be a little better to your liking.Had I read this book with the perspective of a student, or perhaps even as a potential instructor, I suspect my view of the twelve-book poem would have been far more favorable. As it was, I did not. Rather I read it as myself, a person who is rather sarcastic and critical of most things, but especially continuity errors.I found myself stumbling not on the poetry, but on such things as the lengthy description of the pantheon of pandemonium being made with mined gold, wrought with comments on greed and how all those who look for such riches are doomed. This is impressed rather heavily, to be followed by the sun being made with gold and precious gems, heaven being full of similar wealth, and even Christ's chariot of 'sparkles dire' is studded with precious stones and capped with a sapphire throne (book six, line 750 starts you off on the description of the chariot).Were I reading this as a student, I could probably make excuses for the different standards of wealth. I could probably even attempt to justify why Adam and Eve seem to gain absolutely nothing from eating the fruit of knowledge. Adam says often beforehand how working in the garden is good. They are told of Satan's presence in the garden and recognize this as being something to fear. Thus, they know of good and evil. After the fruit, the only alteration is a lustful interlude, to be followed by argument over it. Another angelic intervention where they are told everything to come, and they wander away in sorrowful hope. The Angels are thus the ones who are conveyors of knowledge, not the fruit of knowledge. And so, with Milton, it might as well be the Fruit of Lust and Damnation.As it stands, and as I have read it, Paradise Lost was not what I would call an enjoyable work. I find no great epiphanies in it, or divine inspiration. I find a great deal of misogyny and even more references to classical myths that, if I didn't know it was perfectly fine in Milton's time to interweave Christianity and Greco-Roman myth, I would find a bit off. In total, it read like a rather bad biblical fanfiction with heavy crossover.That being said, Paradise Lost is still a good work to read. For even if it strains my patience and sarcasm, it also gives an excellent perspective on quite a few quotes and characterizations that were to come after. In a way, the book is less important than what people have done with it over the years.
7726084448	Once again, I finally charge an imposing redoubt of the English canon; once again, I’m somehow surprised to find it’s not a chore! Why would it be? The first two books of Paradise Lost are grand, strange, and effortlessly beautiful, and although the poem doesn’t scale those heights again, it didn’t lose my interest for a moment. It’s an uncanny experience, reading Christianity cast as myth. It clarified something, for me, about the relationship between myth and religion in general—although I’m having trouble putting my finger on what, exactly. Something about how story and belief and cosmology worked together, before modernity, to make the universe comprehensible, not by reference to what could be seen, proven, understood, tested—but precisely by reference to what could not. The reality and unreality of Milton’s Jesus makes sense, for me, somehow, of the reality and unreality of antiquity’s Jove.The metaphysical world of Milton’s poem is an uncanny marriage of Biblical history, pagan subtext, 17th-century English cultural norms, and sheer invention. For Milton, the patriarchal order of the English household finds its first and purest expression in the Garden of Eden. Which means that Milton’s Eve must be demure and submissive even before, supposedly, shame enters the world. That this makes no sense is its saving grace. That it is so hopelessly far from universal.
207425622	Milton's epic tale of the fall and redemption of humanity18 September 2011 With the exception of Shakespeare this, I believe, is the greatest work of English Literature. Paradise Lost tells the story, in epic poetic form, of the fall of mankind as outlined in Genesis 1-3. While the story is constricted to the opening chapters of the Bible, the scope of the story itself is much wider and encompasses all of human history (at least up until the death and resurrection of Christ). In fact, it is the death and resurrection of Christ that forms the pivotal turning point of the poem, though it is the fall of humanity that is reason for the redemption that is the poem's focus. A friend of mine once said that Satan that was the main character in the poem and our sympathies were to lie with him. This I cannot disagree with more. Milton was a puritan and it was not his intention to create Satan as a sympathetic character. He wanted to create a poem with a scope that was equivalent to the Odyssey, and while Satan does appear often in the poem, it is very clear that he is the villain of the piece. The central character is Christ, though he does appear to sit in the background a lot, but despite this we are always brought back to him and to his redeeming work. Like the Odyssey, Paradise Lost does not begin at the beginning, but rather after Satan's fall and his plans on wrecking God's creation. At the beginning, Earth has already been created and humanity already exists. However, like the Odyssey, the events that occur before, and after, this part of the play are narrated to us by the archangel Michael (as he tells Adam the past and the future). It is the fall of humanity upon which the play turns, and this can be seen where there is a sexual liaison between Adam and Eve both before and after this event. Like Homer, when Milton wrote the play he was blind and it is said that he narrated the play to his daughter. This raises the question as to whether it really is an epic or not. Some have said that it is a written epic, however Milton himself did not write the poem (just as the Odyssey was originally an oral tale that was written down, many believed by Homer). So, it can be argued that the poem is truly an epic for this one point. However, the poem itself was crafted by Milton, and there was not a period prior to him when the poem was recited orally. It is clear from the play that Milton was a Christian in that his focus is on the grace of God. When humanity falls, God does not want to destroy them, but knows that because he is just,punishment must be dealt. However, Christ steps in and says that he will take the punishment in their place. As such, grace is a major theme that runs throughout the poem and we are reminded that it is through grace that Christ offers himself up on the cross. As such this is not a play that is intended to exonerate and makes us sympathetic towards Satan but to remind us of where we have come from and what Christ's death really means. I must admit, though, the poetic form, and the language used, makes the play very hard to follow, though I wonder if it could be converted into dramatic form. Maybe it is possible, maybe it is not, however I have not encountered anything as such yet. Milton did write a sequel, Paradise Regained, however this poem does not need a sequel as everything that the poem needs to say, of the fall and the redemption, is within the poem itself.
3668992540	I’d been meaning to read this epic for a very long time, and I am not surprised that I head over heels loved it. I admit that I struggled at first – there are two editions of this novel you can get. (Well, more than two.) But you can get the one which has been edited to include modern day punctuation, or you can get the original text. I had the original text (which has since been replaced with the Penguin classic), which means there were no speech marks and I had to pay rapt attention to know who was speaking when. But once I got used to the way it was written, I really liked it. I loved the wording and the beautiful language. It’s a tale I am familiar with, but Milton chose some interesting perspectives. In this epic he humanises the familiar story of the fall a particular angel and the Adam and Eve story. We get to see parts of the story which aren’t shown in the Bible but are assumed to have had happen from the arc of the original.Milton also uses symbols, juxtaposition of scenes and other literary tools when crafting this Christian epic. I loved it all. I know it’s not going to be a good read for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it. My only critique would be that the last two ‘books’ were unnecessary. A little research later I discovered they were tacked on by Milton. He definitely did not need to do that, but I guess it is what it is.
2529784002	In Book VIII of Paradise Lost the Angel Raphael is sent by God to converse with Adam concerning creation, celestial motion and Man’s place in God’s Creation.Adam uses this opportunity given by God to learn about the Human Condition and the future of mankind to ask Raphael about his sex life, thus becoming the world’s first tabloid reporter: Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;Love not the Heav’nly Spirits, and how their loveExpress they, by looks only, or do they mixIrradiance, virtual or immediate touch?To whom the angel with a smile that glowedCelestial rosy red, love’s proper hue, Answered. Let it suffice thee that thou know’stUs happy, and without love no happiness,Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy’st(And pure thou wert created) we enjoyIn eminence, and obstacle find noneOf membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;Easier than air with air. If Spirits embrace,Total they mix, union of pure with pureDesiring; nor restrained conveyance needAs flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul. A poor start to Man’s life after the Fall I feel:‘How do Angels Have Sex? Exclusive kiss-and-tell on Racy Raphael’s outdoor love storms. On page 3, ‘Cores! look at the Apples on that!’And the rest is history.
5161010503	A genuinely brilliant selection of poetry. I never understood before this the degree to which Satan could be a heroic and compelling character. One of my favorite of Milton's takes is his depiction of Eve as the smarter of the Adam and Eve pair. Eve's submissiveness, though appealing to Adam, is on some level a deception. In reality, Eve does not wish to stay as his twin, as she fears becoming only his rib: “Was I to have never parted from thy side / As good have grown there still a lifeless rib” (Milton 9.1153-9.1154). Eve is chosen by the Serpent for her desire for power. Though Milton's text eventually wraps into a space that I think would be hard to characterize as anything but misogynistic, I think the character of this is deeply interesting; Adam and Eve’s punishment for the transgression of gender roles comes in a shift to gender roles. Eve is punished with first pain in childbirth and then submission: “To thy husband’s will / Thine shall submit, he over thee shall rule” (10.195-10.196). So though gender roles are the desired outcome, they're also used as a punishment. And specifically a punishment for the transgression of gender roles, too - the Son of God says to Adam: “Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey / Before his voice, or was she made thy guide / Superior, or but equal, that to her / Thou didst resign thy manhood” (Milton 10.145-10.148). Great poetry, fascinating gender politics. Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |
37198383	I can imagine folks reading this and enjoying it. But not me.The story lying at the heart of Paradise Lost was one I really wanted to read. I’ve heard many times that Satan is portrayed as the sympathetic figure, that he’s honest about the absurdity of rebellion against the ultimate power of God yet still so resentful at being created as a servant that he is steadfast to his doom.Some of the subplots here have become recurrent and mythic elements in literature ever since. I knew, for example, that Sin was Death’s mother, but didn’t know the details of the bizarre incestuous origins (that Satan was Sin’s father and Death’s father and grandfather).The names of the fallen angels are resonant, too. Who is Satan’s second-in-command? Beelzebub, it seems.Unfortunately, the book is a chore and a bore. The whole thing is written in blank verse, which puts a stranglehold on composition. Shakespeare was smarter: he only used meter when he thought it made things better, but Milton has to shove words around and play games counting syllables even when it hurts readability. Frankly I might have been able to slog through this if I’d been able to read it in translation; say in French or German where some later writer had moderated Milton’s poetic compulsion.But that isn’t the only flaw. Milton wants to cram more erudition into this absurdly long poem than it really needs. So he tosses in references to stuff that have nothing to do with the story. Reading along, and suddenly there’s an unknown word: some place Satan flew over, or maybe an animal whose fur is a color that makes a nice comparison to the color of an angel’s robe. But you’ve got to check, in case that unknown word actually is important. The bottom of each page is full of footnotes explaining what these words mean, and almost all of them are worse than useless, since they distract from the flow of the text (which, recall, is already burdened by that meter). But every now and again one of the footnotes is actually relevant, so it’s hard to just skip ‘em all.And there’s just so much dross! The early portions that deal with Satan were barely tolerable, but as soon as Milton moves on to God and Jesus it gets really, really dull. Every word either one of these says has to be applauded by the angelic choir, who apparently have nothing better to do than to tell God how brilliant he is. Milton can’t leave it there, of course; he has to tell us what the angels are wearing at absurd length.Why couldn’t he just tell the darn story? The commentary was more interesting than the book itself.Did anyone ever do a graphic novel version of this? That would be a perfect version. Here’s the comic book version of the angels falling over themselves to suck it up: Frank Miller, where are you?­

22710957	WOW! I had never read Milton until I was forced to in my Chaucer/Shakespeare/Milton class and I was blown away! I absolutely loved this epic poem! Milton was the best educated man in England at this time. He spoke or read every European language and even dabbled in Algonquin. He was part of the Cromwell government and wrote a lot of political tracts that contain the roots of much of the political philosophy that is the foundation of our country. In a scathing political pamphlet called The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, Milton wrote, “all men naturally were born free, being the image and resemblance of God himself…and they lived so until from the root of Adam’s transgression, falling among themselves to doe wrong and violence…they agreed by common league to bind each other from mutual injury." Milton believed very strongly that governments were necessary to protect men from their own vices, but that the “power of the Kings…is nothing else, but what is onely derivative, transferred and committed to them in trust from the people, to the common good of them all, in whom the power yet remains fundamentally." While this concept of executive power is widely accepted in western society today, it was far from the mainstream for seventeenth century England; where the prevailing philosophy was that the king’s right to rule came from God alone. One of the many purposes of Paradise Lost was a medium through which Milton could present his radical political views. In it he argues that men should ideally rule themselves in small familial groups, but because of men’s vices, they must set up stronger governmental systems. He uses Satan, whom he associates with Charles II, as the model of power unrighteously wielded, and sets up Christ as the model of proper authority. In book four, Milton describes Adam and Eve’s character before the fall, “Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure / Severe, but in true filial freedom placed / Whence true authority in men." Eve is submissive to Adam (at first) and, because Adam is submissive to God, he rules gently and correctly over Eve. In this state, men are in a state of freedom. A natural hierarchy exists in the patriarchal order of the family. It is the “true authority of men” because it mirrors man’s relationship with God. Later, in book twelve, Milton makes this point clearer as Michael shows to Adam the decedents of Noah who “Shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell / Long time in peace by families and tribes / Under paternal rule." Milton sees this natural paternal order as the idyllic form of governing mankind, and the one that allows the most freedom and peace for the individual. Of course this peaceful set up cannot last, and in the very next sentence Nimrod “arrogates dominion undeserved” to himself and becomes the first King. This new form of authority is a rebellion from the natural power structure of family rule. It makes the many people on the bottom of the hierarchy slaves to the few on top. While this argument could be brought against most rulers throughout history, Milton implicates Charles II specifically in this description of Nimrod by saying, “from rebellion shall derive his name / Though of rebellion others he accuse." This refers to the restoration of Charles to the throne after the Commonwealth collapsed, after which many of the leaders of Cromwell’s government were hanged as traitorous rebels. Throughout Paradise Lost, Milton makes clear that he is not just critiquing monarchy, but Charles II in particular. He goes so far as to associate Charles with Satan himself. For example, in book one, Milton describes Charles’ heady lifestyle in connection with Satan's brood, “In courts and palaces he also reigns / And in luxurious cities where the noise / Of riot ascends above their loftiest tow’rs…witness the streets of Sodom." Although Milton surely disapproved of this sort of heady living, it is not the main reason that he condemned Charles’ authority. It is Charles’ claim to divine right that so irks Milton, and he uses Satan to show how spurious this claim is, “Me though just right and the fixed laws of Heav’n / Did first create your leader." Later, Adam counters this assertion with Milton’s sentiments, “But man over men / He made not lord, such title to himself / Reserving” (XII.69-71).Book five shows that Satan assembled his crew of demons with the intent that they would help him get what he wanted. In fact, he assembled his leadership together under the false story that they were going to have a council on how best to “receive our King / The great Messiah. He has no thought of the wellbeing of those who follow him, but instead beguiles them with “counterfeited truth” to fight so that Satan can become as God. Satan does not serve them, they serve him; and follow him to their eternal damnation. For Milton, the real evil in monarchy is that inevitably the king will stop seeing himself as the servant of the people, and begin seeing the people as his servants. Compare this to the approach that The Son takes.Christ willingly accepts the role as savior to mankind; knowing that it will mean his death as God’s sacrificial lamb. It is only after this acceptance to be the servant of men that God gives Christ his divine authority: “Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt / With Thee thy manhood also to this throne…All power I give thee." According to this model, an executive should have as his motivation the welfare of the people over whom he lords. It is only through his service to the people that he receives and maintains authority. This is the model that Milton would have earthly governments follow; and if the executive of the nation, whatever title he may bear, does not serve the good of the people, they have the right to select one who will. Though the Commonwealth for which Milton argued so strongly eventually failed, he, like Christ, found a greater victory in defeat. Milton’s political views espoused in Paradise Lost eventually won over England and most of western society. Thomas Paine used very similar verbiage in his extremely influential political tract Common Sense “Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections, the latter negatively by restraining our vices.” And then later he says. “Here then is the rise and origin of government; namely, a mode rendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world.” This is the philosophical bedrock of the concept of a limited government. The idea that powers of government ought to be limited to only that which the people cannot do themselves, and to let people govern themselves as much as possible, is one of the foundational philosophies of the Republican Party today. One can even read Milton in our Declaration of Independence, “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed—That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.” The reach of his work has far surpassed the “fit…though few” audience he envisioned for it. It is a part of our everyday lives. I can’t say whether this idea originated with Milton, but his inclusion of it in Paradise Lost, with its widespread sway in England and here in the US, gave it great influence; which we still feel today. Beyond his political views I was astounded at his theology. I agreed with the vast majority of his doctrinal positions including a trinity of seperate indivduals; God the Father, Jesus Christ and The Holy Ghost (whom he invokes as the muse in good epic fasion). Jesus and several archangels make the earth under the direction of the Father. Satan rebels because of pride and attempts to usurp the Father's athourity, taking a third of the angels of heaven with him. Christ was chosen as the savior in a council in heaven. Men can only be forgiven through the stonement of Christ and through personal repentance...I could go on. He was so ahead of his time in this arena as well. The last thing I wanted to mention was his use of Satan playing the classical hero. Satatn displays the atributes of a classical hero along the lines of Odysseus, and Achiles. Milton does this so that he can show what true heroism is; as modeled by Christ. For Milton the true hero was humble, a servant of the people (which was his ideal for a governmental executive), and found his stregnth in obedience to god's will. He shows throughout the book how the new Christian heroic model is superior to the old classical model of physical prowess, cunning deception, and courtly lover. (for more on this subject I recommend Steadman's Milton and the Renaissance Hero.) It's to bad that Milton is no longer read today as much as it was from the time he wrote it to the twentieth century. It is a true classic, and contains so much that is foundational to our culture still today. If you need help on all of the allusions and classical references in Pardise Lost I recommend this website sponsored by Dartmouth College http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/read... It was very helpful with some of the obscure references.
1585713038	Paradise, before the Fall, was a place where Adam and Eve actually had to do some work for a living! Even though the work was easy – a little bit of pruning and trimming of the verdure in the Garden of Eden – it was still work. John Milton, with his Puritan sensibilities, seems anxious to assure his readers that prelapsarian Adam and Eve weren’t just sitting around like lazy gadabouts, doing nothing. It is in such ways that Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667) not only works as an important epic poem, but also provides a telling look into the English Puritan mind of the 17th century.Milton, of course, wanted to tell the story of the Fall of Man from the first chapters of Genesis using the format of the epic poem, the same way that Homer in the Iliad and the Odyssey, and Virgil in the Aeneid, had explored the mythological beginnings of Greece and Rome respectively. He succeeds in that aim, even if modern readers may tend to take issue with Milton for a number of reasons.In his Introduction, along with a Homeric or Virgilian (but Christianized) invocation of the Muse, Milton announces his intention of achieving “Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme”, along with his hope that he may “justify the ways of God to man” (p. 3). Different readers may feel more or less justified to varying degrees, depending on the degree of their identification with Milton’s Puritan beliefs and ideology; I know that I responded to much of Paradise Lost with a great deal of skepticism. Throughout my reading of the poem, I found myself thinking of my fellow Marylander, H.L. Mencken, and his definition of Puritanism: “The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy.” Puritans thought (and think) a great deal about Hell, and therefore it should be no surprise that one of the beauties of Paradise Lost is the poem’s intricate and vibrant depiction of Hell and its environs: a “dungeon horrible” whose flames offer “No light, but rather darkness visible” (p. 4). Satan, the main character of the early passages of the poem, recalls how he led a third of the angels away from God, fought “In dubious battle on the plains of Heav’n,/And shook [God’s] throne” (p. 5). Satan and the fallen angels who served him suffer in their hellish confinement, but Satan, with his overweening pride, is unrepentant: “To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:/Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav’n” (p. 9).At Satan’s palace of Pandaemonium, the gathering place of all the demons (hence its name), we hear from and learn about the various fallen angels who chose Satan’s side and were damned with him. I was not surprised to see, listed among the demons, the names of various pagan deities of Old Testament times: Moloch, Astarte, Dagon, Osiris, Isis, Belial. I understand Milton’s logic: there is the one true God; all others are false gods, and therefore demonic beings in service to Satan. But I was a bit offended to see that the Olympians too are included among Milton’s demons; it turns out that the architect of Pandaemonium is Hephaestus, who rebelled with Satan and “was headlong sent/With his industrious crew to build in Hell” (p. 22). Really, John? When you owe your poem’s structure – indeed, the entire idea for your poem – to classical sources? It may be theologically consistent, but it seems like base ingratitude nonetheless.Milton’s Satan, who has generated a great deal of critical ink down the centuries, is a compelling character. I was impressed at the psychological acumen that Milton displayed in portraying the character, as when his Satan, temporarily escaped from Hell to try to bring about the fall of humankind, remarks in Book IV that “Which way I fly is Hell: myself am Hell” (p. 75). Similarly, the poem's narrator informs us that Satan can never escape “The Hell within him, for within him Hell/He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell/One step no more than from himself can fly” (p. 74).Even freed for a time from the physical torments of Hell, Satan carries his own personal Hell within him because of his own choices, and can never free himself from it, even if he wants to (and at some deep level, he doesn’t). Who among us has not known a person like that? How many of us have been a person like that? It is in that spirit of absolute, unreasoning pride that Milton’s Satan declares, “Evil, be thou my good” (p. 76), rather than even consider acknowledging, and submitting to, a power higher than himself.I think that Milton’s Satan may have been intended in part to express the poet’s dislike for the spreading Enlightenment rationalism of his time. Satan, reconnoitering Eden in search of ways to traduce this new creation of God, reflects on how God has forbidden Adam and Eve to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge, and asks himself, “[K]nowledge forbidd’n?/Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord/Envy them that? Can it be sin to know,/Can it be death? And do they only stand/By ignorance, is that their happy state,/The proof of their obedience and their faith?” (p. 87) Troubling questions – and meant to be, I think. Indeed, many a modern reader of Paradise Lost might feel just that way.Yet I believe that Milton is using his Satan to demonstrate what he would view as the limitations of rationality. Later in the poem, the angel Raphael, speaking no doubt on God’s behalf, states that “knowledge is as food, and needs no less/Her temperance over appetite, to know/In measure what the mind may well contain,/Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns/Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind” (p. 153). For Milton, the fact that God has imposed a limit is enough; it is for our own good. God knows best. Humankind exists to serve God, and should accept without question the limits that God imposes. God said it, John Milton believes it, and that settles it.Much of the central part of Paradise Lost consists of the kind of extended flashback characteristic of epic, as the angel Raphael recounts to Adam the story of how Satan rebelled against God and started the “war in Heaven” referred to in the Book of Revelation. In Raphael’s retelling, the great battle lasted for a Biblically appropriate three days. The demons’ deployment on the second day of new gunpowder-fueled machines of war, “deep-throated engines” (p. 140), gave them a temporary bit of ascendancy (an anti-technology critique, perhaps?). But the Son of God intervened on the third day and gave the forces of God the final victory. Raphael concludes by sternly instructing Adam and Eve to heed God’s command and stay away from the Tree of Knowledge. Spoiler alert: the first two human beings do not end up heeding the words of the angel. The process by which Satan infiltrates Eden, possesses the serpent, and tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit is set forth at sufficient length that the reader may be forgiven for wishing that humankind would hurry up and fall. Yet it is a deeply sad and powerful moment when Eve, separated from Adam, succumbs to Satan’s temptation: “[H]er rash hand in evil hour/Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she ate:/Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat/Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe,/That all was lost” (p. 205). What may surprise a first-time reader of Paradise Lost is how Adam responds to the news. He deplores what Eve has done, to be sure; but knowing that Eve is now doomed to die (even though neither of them is really sure what death is), he chooses to eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge, to die with Eve – because he loves her so much that he feels he cannot live without her:”Should God create another Eve, and I/Another rib afford, yet loss of thee/Would never from my heart; no no, I feel/The link of nature draw me: flesh of flesh,/Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state/Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.” (p. 209)It is a heroic moment – one that makes me think of that question that gets asked on every sophomore-year Milton midterm in every English department at every college in North America: “Is Satan the hero of Paradise Lost?” The short answer: No. Satan does display a form of courage, to be sure, to launch himself forth across the abyss of Chaos in his determination to find Eden and ruin God's new creation. And indeed, as commentator John Leonard of the University of Western Ontario points out, courage is the only virtue that the demons recognize or appreciate. Yet what courage Satan displays is strictly for evil ends; and he knows that he will live forever, albeit in torment. Adam, by contrast, engages the fearful unknown of death for the sake of the woman he loves. Yet it is still a sin; and Milton shows how the first couple’s sin changes their character, bringing about the first marital quarrel. Eve asks Adam why he didn’t positively forbid her from going off on her own, provoking human history’s first I-told-you-so, from Adam: “I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold/The danger, and the lurking Enemy/That lay in wait” (p. 215).God pronounces Adam and Eve’s doom, and, in what seems an arbitrary act, curses the serpent even though He knows the serpent was just a reptile possessed by the devil – “To judgement he proceeded on th’ accused/Serpent though brute, unable to transfer/The guilt on him who made him instrument of mischief” (p. 222). Really? An omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent God cannot differentiate, in terms of degrees of moral guilt, between a supreme spirit of evil and a dumb animal? While Milton falls all over himself assuring his readers that it’s all in accordance with mystical divine justice that we humans can’t possibly understand, one senses here the tension between Milton’s wish to stay thoroughly orthodox on the one hand, and on the other hand his sense that the Christian story he so thoroughly reveres may contain some internal contradictions.Meanwhile, back in Pandaemonium, Satan boasts to the demons of his success, calling attention to the fact that the new name that he received when he fell from Heaven means “enemy” or “adversary” – “for I glory in the name,/Antagonist of Heav’n’s Almighty King” (pp. 227-28). But Adam’s despair at having brought the burden of original sin upon all his descendants is relieved by a visit from the archangel Michael, who provides a look forward toward the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament Redemption, and assures Adam that by henceforth obeying the dictates of God, Adam, though compelled “to leave this Paradise”, can “possess/A paradise within thee, happier far” (p. 286). On that note of cautious optimism, Paradise Lost ends, as Michael leads Adam and Eve out of Paradise, and into their brave new world.As commentator Leonard helpfully explains, Milton wrote Paradise Lost under difficult circumstances; the Restoration of King Charles II had put an end to Oliver Cromwell’s Commonwealth, and forever destroyed Milton’s dreams of a Puritan English republic of endlessly prayerful and industrious citizens. Friends of Milton were being hanged, drawn, and quartered in those days for their support of the execution of King Charles I decades earlier, and Milton himself faced the threat of execution for a time. Happily, he survived, and Paradise Lost stands as a poetic testament to the depth and sincerity of his conviction. I can and do admire the greatness of his poetry, even as I disagree with his Puritan beliefs.
4133894669	¿Puede un argumento conocido y repetido hasta la saciedad resultar atractivo? Solo si alcanza los niveles de lirismo y belleza presentes en El Paraíso Perdido. El título es bastante sugerente, por no decir obvio, así que ya sabemos de que va: ángeles caídos que infructuosamente se rebelan, seres humanos tentados desacatan labrando su trágico destino y una envidiada legión de ángeles leales acompañan al todopoderoso.El mito bíblico es la excusa para abordar temas fundamentales como la libertad y la existencia. No pasa mucho antes de que notemos que hay un subtexto que habla más allá de lo enunciado y que los espacios descritos aluden a estados humanos y a condiciones internas. Los seres de la creación se acercan a la noción de cielo en la medida de que su estado interior se nutre de armonía y bienestar, y se acercan a la idea de infierno cuando el sufrimiento y la desesperación los acompañan. Es el cotidiano ejercicio de la libertad el que nos mantiene en un lugar-estado o en otro. Milton encuentra maneras de que experimentemos esos estados internos y de hacernos imaginarlos como lugares, abandona la rima y con una prosa lírica rica en descripciones potentes, busca generar en el lector una imagen clara y sentida de la desolación de los seres malignos y de la placidez de los seres divinos. Logra que cielo e infierno, especialmente este último, sean experimentados con tal viveza que sería envidiada por los mismos autores bíblicos. Dejando a un lado el componente herético del libro, las imágenes logradas desde la riqueza expresiva impactan de tal manera que el creyente reafirma su fe y el ateo duda de sus convicciones.
1064872261	An epic poem deserves an epic review - I can't promise to deliver on that. But at least it's heartfelt.This poem is what made John Milton one of THE names in literature. And yes, it's a poem as long as a book. In fact, it has over 10 thousand lines of verse and consists of 12 books. I think the number of books, or chapters if you will, was different at first and the version with 12 chapters/books was a later revision and done because of Virgil's Aeneid. Milton used blank verses which is to say the poem doesn't rhyme. He used several different stylistic features such as starting the poem in medias res: somewhere in the midst of the story, the background story being told in retrospect. There are also a few acrostics, my favourite of which was in book IX where a verse describing the serpent tempting Eve to eat the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden spells out "SATAN". *snickers*Yes, the title is a dead giveaway, it's the story of how mankind was banned from paradise so me recounting it with a few comments isn't actually going to spoiler anyone. There are two narratives in the poem: that of Lucifer (Satan) and that of Adam and Eve. In the beginning (see what I did there ;P), Lucifer and the other rebelling angels have been defeated and subsequently banished to Hell (aka Tartarus). Satan resides in Pandæmonium, the capital city of Hell, and rules thanks to his ... persuasiveness (he's good with words and, well, tempting). He thus recruits more followers from among the residents of Hell. When God has a new and favourite creation, mankind and Earth, Satan volunteers to corrupt both. How he gets to the Garden of Eden actually reminded me of some Greek myths (I shan't spoiler which).Meanwhile, the reader is taken back to the actual battle for Heaven and boy, what a truly epic war that was despite it only lasting 3 days ((view spoiler)[I was surprised that God's son (the spirit that later will enter the body of Jesus Christ) was the one to single-handedly defeat Lucifer and the other rebelling angels ... I mean, then why fight it out for 3 days?! Seems like a waste? (hide spoiler)])!Back to Adam and Eve, freshly created after the end of the war (ironic that I've finished this book on the anniversary of D-Day): they have been given the Garden of Eden where they are to live entirely free and as rulers of all creation (yes, the entire planet Earth is the Garden of Eden apparently), except for one rule: do not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death! We all know how that ends but I can tell you that Milton changed the story of the temptation and subsequent fall in quite a satisfying way ((view spoiler)[Eve is tempted through her vanity but Adam, after the two having been in a sin-free but still romantic relationship, willingly and knowingly commits the same sin because he's a romantic and a hero and if she has to die, so will he * (hide spoiler)]). Nevertheless, spoiler alert, the two have sex after eating the apples and then we get all the negative emotions a Catholic Priest would be so proud to recount (I shan't, because it pisses me off *).Satan, meanwhile, goes home to brag and ... Well, the two kids finally find their courage and admit to God what they have done, appealing for his mercy. It's not really a spoiler that they are not, in fact, killed. "Only" cast out. But not before a vision of the future and some lecture from the Archangel Michael (I never liked the guy). * (view spoiler)[The only problem I had with the more "romantic" presentation of the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve was the noble guy sacrificing himself, from his point of view, for the woman he loves. The woman, of course, being simply vain and therefore easy enough to tempt. However, Milton apparently tried to even out the scales by pointing out that Adam was more of a sinner than Eve, technically, since he had been aware while Eve had been corrupted. What really never was to my liking is the stupid notion of love being a sin when it's "consumated" - fucking Catholics (yes, I'm allowed to say that as I was born one)! (hide spoiler)]The problem I always had with the story is that I'm on Lucifer's side. And no, not since the popular show. Way before that. Because his desire to rebel against his creator stems from his unwillingness to be subjugated by God and his Son and I completely understand that. The whole subjugation trope in Catholicism and many other religions rubs me the wrong way.Apart from my stance towards any form of religion, however, this is a work of art. Pure (or not so much) and simple (also not really). Milton himself was very eloquent, obviously, and made quite a great case in favour of Satan (he never actually says that the plan is wicked, which was even more scandalous back in the day). Some will, of course, dispute that, but it's how I indeed see it. I also like that he made marriage a central theme as that combines the "mundane" with the "epic" and made Adam and Eve more approachable instead of these weird child-like creatures that are suddenly corrupted. After all, it IS a story of mankind and how we got to this point, after a fashion. It might be "weird" for some people to read any story in verse form but all I can say is that it's totally worth it. No, this wasn't my first, but I also don't read epic poems too frequently. For those worrying, I was actually surprised how easily the verses flowed here. Admittedly, I sometimes picked up my paperback copy to read a few verses in print, but not because I wasn't able to follow - reading with my own eyes is a different process for me and I enjoy it very much so I wanted to read certain passages twice just for the hell of it (ha! another one!). I do recommend Simon Vance's audio version though as that emphasizes the beauty of the language.(No, that is not God. Hell is much more neat and organized than I expected. *lol*)["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
2754371450	"Mi voz has oído tú frecuentementey nunca te ha causado susto alguno,más bien te ha alegrado; ¿qué sucedeque ahora se ha vuelto tan espantosa?¿Y quién te ha dicho a ti que vas desnudo?¿Has comido del árbol prohibido?"John Milton compuso su trabajo más emblemático "The Lost paradise" en 1667, se dice que ya ciego dictó los versos a sus hijas que le ayudaron en esta labor. Debo decir que luego de haber leído casi 20 épicas creo ser justo al ponerle 3 estrellas, aunque seguro también hay mucho de mi experiencia y opinión personal para darle tal calificativo.Este poema épico desde luego trata de uno de los temas más importantes de la religión católica que es el pecado original y la expulsión del Edén de los primeros humanos creados por Dios. Sin embargo, el poema también focaliza en Satanás (Satán también es llamado), que sin ser el personaje principal de la obra tiene un protagonismo interesante y que desde luego atrae una parte del poema. De alguna manera el poeta nos trata de sentir cierto grado de comprensión por él, quizás por eso el relato empieza mostrándonos a Satán encerrado en el Infierno y sufriendo junto con los demás las penurias de la derrota y del destierro. Coincido con algunos críticos en no considerar a Satán el personaje principal dentro de toda la estructura del poema. Algunos lo han querido ver así sobre todo por la tendencia del romanticismo (¡del siglo XIX!) de colocar héroes oscuros o con conflictos profundos en la poesía romántica. Aquí Milton ha querido sobre todo poner el tema del pecado original y de las consecuencias desastrosas de no obedecer a Dios y la ligereza en llevarse de ciertas pasiones en contra de la virtud. Pero es cierto, Satán se nos pinta como una especie de antihéroe, donde se describe sus grandes virtudes o apariencia majestuosa pero también su maldad y sus vicios. No tan duros a mi parecer como debió haber sido la caracterización. Sin embargo, también lo vemos por momentos en el sufrimiento, en la perdición y en la desesperación. No es la maldad absolutamente encarnada, sino por momentos nos lo pintan como un héroe de yelmo, espada y escudo que busca ascender o entronizarse."Pocos saben lo que me cuesta aquellavana jactancia y bajo qué interiorestormentos gimo; mientras levantadome adoran en el trono del Infierno,ostentando la diadema y el cetro,tanto más hondo caigo, sólo soysupremo en la desgracia"El poema está dividido en 12 cantos como la Eneida, se cuenta a través de recursos temporales la revolución y lucha de Satán y sus huestes contra Dios y sus ángeles y arcángeles. Esto vendría a ser una historia pasada de mucho antes. Desde luego después se trata del tema principal cuando se refiere a la pérdida del paraíso por Adán y Eva. Nuevamente se usan recursos para contarnos la creación del mundo con todo lo que ya sabemos del génesis y luego saber la visión de Adán y cómo fue creada Eva. El desenlace final viene a ser lo que da el título a la obra. Hay parte de la sociedad de Milton, conocimientos teóricos y prácticos, crítica al anglicanismo y al catolicismo, pero no son tan palpables.La técnica y los recursos tiene mucho de Homero o Virgilio. Suele ser repetitivo en muchos pasajes.La estructura es bastante simple, incluso no tiene rima (algo que me sorprendió mucho y considero que le debió haber dado más libertad). Comparándolo con Dante (¡quien escribió 300 años antes!) hace ver a este poema muy por debajo en mi opinión.Hablando un poco de "lo malo", siendo sincero y hay que decirlo claramente el tema es muy limitado para que cualquier autor pueda explotarlo demasiado, pues todo lo que se cuenta ya se sabe y Milton no podía salirse demasiado del canon del cristianismo. Incluso el lugar donde se desarrollan los hechos es bastante corto y no se puede hacer gran cosa con respecto a eso. Satán, como mencioné, no es el antihéroe que pensé que sería. Es mencionado y bien trabajado pero en un momento dado se esfuma y no se da más explicaciones ni seguimiento. Otro problema para mí fue que aparte del hecho de que uno como cristiano ya sabe dónde va a terminar todo incluso Dios es omnisciente (obviamente), lo sabe todo y ni siquiera se oculta eso en el poema. Sabe lo que Satán hará, cómo lo hará, cuándo lo hará, sabe si fallará o no, Etc lo que le quita suspenso. Hablo todo esto como lo que yo pienso o valoro de un "Poema épico". Por otro lado, resulta muy extraño ver a los ángeles guerreando entre ellos y a Jesús enfurecido como si fuera un Hércules. Trasladar al Cielo todo el rigor bélico, las frases amenazadoras, los duelos y las burlas, parece un poco duro de masticar. Por supuesto, entiendo el objetivo y no deja de ser acertado la adaptación pero me resultó extraña. También hay declaraciones fuertes contra la mujer y anacrónicas que sin embargo no consideré en absoluto para ponerle la nota. "Estas ruedas que viste de mujerestan hermosas que diosas parecían,tan joviales, lisonjeras y ufanas,están vacías de las cualidadesen que se basa el honor de una mujery constituye su principal elogio;pues han sido criadas y educadaspara el goce del lascivo apetito,cantar, bailar, vestirse, y mantenerla lengua activa y mover los ojos"El poema tiene para mí muchas cosas que me gustaron: la razón de la molestia de Satan me pareció muy buena (aunque nuevamente la situación resulta extraña) así como su rebeldía por ser desplazado. A medida que avanza el poema te preguntas por qué el Cielo es así con eso de las jerarquías o las violencias. Lo que más me gustó fue cuando Satán tienta a Eva con su belleza (sus palabras y sus artificios incluso su estupor inicial al ver la belleza de Eva) y luego cuando Adán es revelado de los acontecimientos muchos que pasarán después que permite a Milton (quizás recién) poder hacer comparaciones, reflexiones acerca de la maldad del hombre. También me gustó que mencionen a los dioses falsos como Moloc, Baal o Camos (osea de otras religiones) como ángeles malignos e incluso a Belcebú. Todos ellos están en el ejército de Satán. Me acompañé durante la lectura de este poema de los fabulosos dibujos de Doré que tenía en otra edición. Debo decir en verdad que estoy muy feliz de haber por fin leído este gran clásico.
3555081484	Paradise Lost is a unique piece of poetry from many, many centuries ago. It's the retelling of the classic bible story of creation, God, Satan, Adam and Eve. I had to read a select few of the stories for a British Literature class, so I had the opportunity to delve into this book.This is definitely one of the greatest narrative poetry collections. John Milton's writing has a unique perspective the Bible, and it was really cool to read it. It's definitely a hard read and I recommend listening (or reading!) some professional takes on this work. It makes the poems SO much cooler. It'll take weeks to read through this collection and to understand it, it may take a bit longer. Even though it's a challenge, it's worth it. It's a unique and interesting set of poems that is so beautifully written. It's a beautiful piece of art.I really liked Paradise Lost Book 9 - Adam and Eve's story. I had the opportunity to spend weeks analyzing this piece, so it sits warmly in my heart. Is Milton blaming Adam? Eve? Satan? God? You decide, but I think he blames God. If God has a plan for everything, why did he plan for the two to be split up and Satan suddenly arrive? Why didn't anyone remind Adam and Eve not to talk to scary, talking snakes? Where did Gabriel run away to?! There's so many questions, and the beauty of the writing and take on the story is just magnificent. Four out of five stars.

500807813	Paradise Lost builds upon a tradition of epic poetry begun with the work of Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey. I have held back from fully reviewing this work for a while but I feel that I can at least provide a decent review at this stage.I first read Paradise Lost when one of my teachers recommended it during a devotional session at school. I knew nothing about the work prior to this mention, but being the dedicated reader that I am I knew any book recommended by a teacher as being for me would likely be academic or literary. Part of me was interested in the book because of the connotation and the status of reading a complex work of fiction. Part of me was intrigued by the idea of a classic reinterpretation of the tale of The Garden of Eden.So I read Paradise Lost and I will admit that I found it trickier than any text I had tried before. I found it trickier than the translations of Homer I recently read as though it was written in English it has a level of complexity and density to the poetry which is unique and brilliant. When I first read the poem I was blown away by the use of metaphor and other symbolism. I was stunned by the language itself, beautifully archaic and yet still relevant for modern readers. In my eyes Paradise Lost is one of the great works of all time that should be read by any serious reader. The fact that the author composed it while blind adds a little to the legend surrounding the poem but it is the poem itself which has survived across time and it is the poem which is magnificent.I recommend reading Paradise Lost because of its status as a literary monument. Many, many texts reference it, including from memory Frankenstein. I recommend reading it for the beautiful language and the story, the themes of which are universally fascinating. I recommend reading it because you like the idea of reading it. Whatever reason you can devise for reading it I encourage you to find some time and read it.
3972338913	Efsane, yıllarca beklediğimiz, meraktan çatladığımız bir kitap Milton'ın Paradise Lost'u. Beklentilerim büyüktü ama İlyada üzerine (okuma sayımı hatırlamıyorum) tez yapmış bir yüksek arkeolog olarak daha ilk sayfalarda ele geçirdi beni. Bu bir destan! Tanrısal var oluşun hikayesini bir kahramanlık metni, destanı olarak okumak müthiş bir lezzet. Sanki hiç İlyada okumayıp ilk defa okuyormuş heyecanına kapıldım, büyük keyif aldım. Özellikle destansı, şiirsel anlatı seviyorsanız muhakkak edinin. Çok beğendim!
2115954711	A running joke at the English department from which I undergraduated was that Christianity has in fact three Testaments: Old, New, and Paradise Lost. It's funny because it's (almost) true: Milton's influence on popular imagination is hard to overstate. He was inordinately successful at synthesizing, narrativizing, and propagating "extra-Biblical" European Medieval tradition.But he would not have been so successful if his art were anything less than excellent. It takes the modern eye and inner ear a little while to acclimate to Milton's style and use of language - some research may be required for full appreciation - but his poetry rewards effort. I have found myself returning regularly to reread certain passages, especially Lucifer's soliloquy in Book IV. Paradise Lost is as packed with genius as the palace of Pandaemonium is packed with Heaven's rebels; and if Christians have responded to that wealth by deriving doctrine where Milton meant "merely" to give pleasure, it is not the poet who should be blamed.
4595632615	Milton visse in un periodo di fermento e instabilità durante l'interregno repubblicano di Cromwell. Credeva nel potere educativo dei libri e delle parole. Il Paradiso Perduto rappresenta la perdita di una condizione di innocenza per sete di conoscenza e libertà che invariabilmente comporta anche il doversi confrontare con il male in senso lato. Il testo inglese musicale e fiorito, simile a quello usato da Shalespeare, trasmette sia le concezioni radicali che tradizionaliste dell'Autore, le sue battaglie per maggiore equità e libertà di scelta - era un fautore del divorzio a quei tempi - il senso di un rapporto privato, individuale con Dio per salvare la propria anima. Ma soprattutto, preso atto della perdita di una condizione "paradisiaca", l'umanità affondata nel nascere può trovare i mezzi per riscattarsi... "They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, through Eden took their solitary way." Unica nota di demerito, considerando l'importanza di questo libro nella letteratura e nel pensiero inglese, la colpevolizzazione di Eva - alla base del peccato originale - che Adamo non è riuscito a tenere a bada e sottomettere in Paradiso. In Terra, i ruoli saranno ben definiti ed Eva accetterà suo malgrado la condizione di inferiorità per espiare il suo senso di colpa. "Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey before his voice? or was she made thy guide superiour, or but equal, that to her thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place wherein God set thee above her made of thee, and for thee, whose perfection far excelled hers in all real dignity?"
303834106	You're so vain, you probably don't know this poem's about you!I didn't expect to see such a varied portrayal of vanity in this epic poem; but vanity is everywhere! Everyone is vain! Shout it from Mount Sinai! Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. I've always been a firm believer that there are not seven deadly sins, but rather one, with (at least) seven (but probably infinite) permutations. That said, I'm not a religious man, so this has always been sort of theoretical/aesthetic musing which I have done between sins (like intellectual "Hail Mary"s - thinking about sin sometimes to mentally atone for it). And that sin is PRIDE, or VANITY. It's everywhere, and I'm tempted to think even the humblest people are just better than most of us at window-dressing their vanities (OK, maybe I'm a bit cynical). So the relevance of this diatribe against vanity and Paradise Lost? It's so central to the story, to each character, that its as inescapable as the blatant misogyny (which is probably equal parts Christianity and Milton). Paradise Lost reminded me of a line from the same speach as previously quoted from Ecclesiastes: "Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us." Paradise Lost affirms my belief that vanity is older than time, older than man.So "All is vain" is a rather high statement, I think Milton's portrayals of Gabriel, Michael, God, and Messiah are somewhat beyond reproach of vanity, but as a result I found them extremely bland. Cut-paper puppets posing as angels (hand-in-hand like those cut-outs you learn in kindergarten). It's no wonder that we readers relate so well to Milton's satan - he seems more human than anyone else (moreso even than Adam and Eve, which at best are each only a half of the Human). He seemed to me a kind of bastard-child of Hamlet and Iago (a frightening thought!), both very self-aware and introspective, and also a trickster and fraud. Maybe the most poignant moment in the poem for the reader's perception of Satan is when he comes to Earth, and is taken away with it's beauty, that he doubts his own convictions to his yet-to-be committed crimes on humanity: And like a devilish engine back recoilsUpon himself; horror and doubt distractHis troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stirThe Hell within him; for within him HellHe brings, and round about him, nor from HellOne step, no more than from himself, can flyBy change of place: Now conscience wakes despair,That slumbered; wakes the bitter memoryOf what he was, what is, and what must beWorse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. Satan feels some remorse at his break with Heaven - he sees even in the terrestrial Paradise of Eden the perfect bliss that he gave up. But he can't escape Hell, it is his punishment. While earlier in the epic he contends that "The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven" it is evident that that is not the case, that no matter what he pushes his mind to believe of his condition, he is burdened forever with the Hell within. As a modern reader, and maybe I have this in common with Milton's contemporaries, I feel very much a contention between optimism and cynicism, which I saw personified in Satan. In Book I especially, his optimism and enthusiasm seem unrestrained, he hasn't resigned himself to his tartaric suffering, but rather optimistic that it is a matter of perspective: "better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven" - his motto. But by Book IV, he is pained by what he has lost and knows that he can never regain - Heaven is unattainable, and his mind's rationalized illusion of heaven can never be anything but a pale ghost of Paradise. We can also relate to Satan's vanity, or what is his jealousy of being passed over by God's nepotism. When God creates his Son, and holds him in favor over the other angels, Satan feels slighted, he feels that he has earned through merit the highest rank, but is forever denied it (note that Milton refers to him as the "prince of darkness" - even in Hell he is denied kingship). The parallels with Othello are obvious, though it would be dangerous to take them too far. Cassio is not a Jesus, even less so is Othello a God (Othello being perhaps the most vainglorious of Shakespeare's creations, obsessed with his own mythos as war-god). However, it gets at the root of evil, as offered by Milton, which is that even the best of us (angels) can be affected by pride, and pride leads us to do monstrous things.Our "original Father and Mother," Adam and Eve are the center of the latter half of the epic. They feel very incomplete, which is perhaps the result of Eve's literal half-ness (being the product of Adam's "rib" or "side" - which as a result leaves only one full half to Adam as well). We see vanity first in Eve, when she describes her first day on Earth. She awakes in the shade, and seeing a river follows it to its source (searching perhaps for her own origins, as she wakes up in confusion); when she reaches a pool she sees her reflection and is enamored with it. God tells her that she is looking at her own image, and to seek Adam - but when she finds him, her vanity for an instant remains: yet methought less fair,Less winning soft, less amiably mild,Than that smooth watery image: Back I turned Eve is certainly vain upon creation, though her growing adoration for Adam seems sincere. Even so, Satan immediately notices her vanity as weakness, and targets her alone, believing her easier to seduce (perhaps because she is easily seduced by her own image). Adam is farther removed from vanity, though he lacks the perfect completeness attributable to God. I believe, and maybe I am alone, that there is something vain in love. One loves to be loved. When Adam discovers Eve's transgression, he is not convinced by her that to eat the knowing fruit is a good idea, he doesn't put value in the story of the serpent. But, he puts value in his love of Eve, over his devotion to God. He thinks to himself that he would rather die and be punished with Eve than to outlive her, and thus outlive her love.
1953694995	It's tricky to review this book - a decision needs to be made as to whether you are reviewing Milton's epic poem or Fowler's huge set of notes that go with it.I started trying to read Fowler's notes but soon gave up. They are probably of fantastic assistance to the academic, but for the casual reader like me it just destroyed the flow of reading. So in the end I stuck with just Milton and apart from looking up odd references I simply slowly read it end to end.It's a surprisingly approachable read for something written in 1667. Milton may have been a master of weaving in a million and one allusions to the bible and other literature - but mostly you can follow the poem, even if you probably don't appreciate its full richness, without knowing these.It's taken me a long time to finish, dipping in and out over weeks and perhaps a speedier more consistent reading pattern may have improved my enjoyment.Footnote: for anyone confused about my reference to Fowler's notes, I actually read the Routledge edition, not the penguin one in the picture. But when I used that ISBN it brought me to this one. The Penguin and Routledge editions are substantially different - not in the actual poem but in the addition of Fowler's large amount of additional information. However, I suspect of interest to the academic or very serious reader only.
4586779791	Una de la obras más relevantes del siglo XVII y de la literatura en general. Un poema épico que rescata la tradición judeocristiana y aborda, desde una nueva perspectiva, la pérdida de Adán y Eva del Jardín del Edén tras las retorcidas manipulaciones de un resentido pero astuto Satanás.Con una estructura de doce cantos y verso blanco (carente de rima), la epopeya de Milton nos adentra en los conflictos entre Dios y su ángel caído, un Satanás que pecó de soberbia, se sublevó ante su creador y que acabó a forma de castigo enviado a los infiernos junto al resto de sus ángeles rebeldes. La obra no describe los orígenes de este conflicto sino que da inicio durante éste y pasa a centrarse más en la venganza del ángel herido a través de la nueva creación divina.A nivel literario la obra tiene un valor incalculable, su lenguaje es irreprochable. En términos de contenido es interesante por su retrato de un Satanás complejo, un Dios perfecto y distante y un hombre y una mujer dotados de una ferviente humanidad incluso antes de perder el paraíso y ser castigados con los males que atraviesan y definen la experiencia humana.No es una lectura ligera en absoluto. Lleva su tiempo, demanda atención y puede incluso ser pesada por partes pero es un imprescindible.
4404934306	A lush, gorgeous classic filled with love and drama. Almost nothing compares to the language Milton uses; it is so rich, so resonating, so meaningful. Each time I have read this I have found something new.
5363710488	Let me save you some time: The Devil gets all the best lines. God talking to the angels (yawn). But Beelzebub conniving with his demons, that is a lark! "Tis better to rule in hell than serve in heaven". That is the motto of every rebel who ever lived. Milton's follow-up, PARADISE REGAINED flopped big-time. I wonder why.

3186350008	More than a little hubris to "review" Paradise Lost. I am glad I listened to it while I followed along reading it ... that kept me going with forward progress and not get bogged down in the details. It would be so easy to want to follow every allusion, seek out every footnote, but for a first reading, just reading was exactly what I needed. Now I can dip in and out and seek out more and why Milton wrote the things he wrote. I do have concerns with "fictionalizing" scripture and things hid from or not elaborated in scripture. At times, I was a little put off/taken aback by his portrayal of Eve, it felt ... condescending and patronizing.Overall, though, I enjoyed reading this. I really liked reading it alongside Lewis' Space Trilogy. I feel like the end of Perelandra took many cues from Paradise Lost. There were so many connections I made as I read.I enjoyed the Simon Vance audio from Audible. I haven't yet read Paradise Regained as it wasn't on the audiobook.
4721793075	This book is written for almost all communities not only Christian. A good writer has no specific community, I believe that and obeyed. The epical idea is almost the same as heaven, hell, God and demons.During studying in primary school, I heard this author's name, and then I searched about this book's ambition and depths.The nicest line of this book which you may concentrate on,...."Thither let us tendFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves;"
3528390009	I'm really surprised that I liked this one as much as I did because when I read it, I wasn't really looking for something as difficult and heavy and poetic as this. But I found myself fascinated with the story and I'm ultimately glad that I took the time to wade through it. I read this along with my son, who had to read and study a portion of it for school. The language makes it really difficult, but if you use a modern English translation alongside the author's intended language, it is much more accessible.
2813926547	Adem ile Havva’nın cennetten kovuluş öyküsünü Homeros ve Virgil gibi destansı şiirle okuyucuya sunan "Kayıp Cennet / Lost Paradise", epik olay örgüsüyle edebiyat tarihinin en kıymetli eserlerinden biri. John Milton’ın kör olmasına rağmen olayları mitolojik bir şekilde anlatması öyküyü fazlasıyla ilgi çekici kılıyor. "Gılgamış Destanı"nda anlatılanın üzerine koyarak karakterleri mitolojik birer kahraman dönüştüren "Kayıp Cennet", kovuluş kısmına kadar okuyucuya eğlenceli ve sürükleyici bir fantastik örnek sunuyor. Buna rağmen, hikayesi ve dinin temeli gereği finaliyle oldukça cinsiyetçi bir yaklaşıma bürünen kitapta cennetten kovuluşun sebebinin Pandora gibi Havva’ya yıkılması ve kadınları tasvir etme biçimi günümüze pek de uygun değil ve rahatsız edici. Yine de destansı diliyle adeta fantastik edebiyatın temellerini bir üst seviyeye taşıyan Milton’ın şaheseri her şeye rağmen kesinlikle okunmayı hak ediyor.

4873594301	The way I enjoy "Paradise Lost" is by viewing and experiencing it as a work of fantasy fiction/mythology, much the way I do with a Greek tragedy or Norse myth. What I appreciate about it is the majesty and power of its poetry and the epic, vast imaginative terrain it describes. The whiff of misogyny is off-putting, of course, and so are many traditional Christian assumptions here, but I read "Paradise" from as non-judgemental a place as possible, allowing it to work as fiction and poem and epic. I love anything with intense emotion and pathos. And beauty of execution. I liked that Satan is a sympathetic character, and that Adam and Eve act as flawed characters who turn on themselves under pressure - that kind of thing. I don't look to "Paradise" for spiritual truth, or illumination. Rather, for me, the poem has the emotionally moving essence of powerful tales, of tragedy of Shakespearean ilk and Greek and Norse mythology. There is symbolism in it, but you don't read "Beowulf" or the "Odyssey" for spiritual instruction, for example; if you did, you'd certainly find something offensive or misleading. "Paradise" belongs in that category for me.
41517819	Surely one of the greatest books of all time! It's worth reading at least once a year. This year (2008) was Milton's 400th. Now it's 2011. I've read it every year for the past four years.It's 2012 now, and I am reading it again, this time to compare Milton to Dante.The biggest difference I have come away with this time is one of temperature: Dante is all heat and emotion, whereas Milton is a man of cool logic. Which do I like better? Both.2014. Did I really miss reading this last year? I read a few lines yesterday and couldn't resist another trip.I especially enjoyed the beauty of the Creation narrative this time and saw why it so inspired Haydn.2016. In beautiful language, Milton justifies the ways of God to man from eternity to eternity. 2018. My plan for this year is to read it the first twelve days of each month, one book per day. I want to let the words sink in.2020. Milton has so much to say to the characters in the other books I’m reading.2022. No longer a chore to read, it is now pure pleasure.
2549070658	Figes’ Tree sent me back into this wormhole for the third time. Perfection, nary an ill word anywhere found. Reminder that once a decade or more is not enough. Bonus: if you’re a Male Rights Activist then forthwith you to thou bookseller with haste. EVERYTHING that’s wrong with the world is a single chick’s fault. Boom. End of THAT debate. It’s all their fault. Ribs! Anyone else feel Eve should be lauded for having the desire for knowledge and the chutzpah to go for it? The worst slander against Woman is that She was insatiate with walking around the same garden and blissfully, knowingly vacant so action she a-took? I call that courage, I call that laudable. Plus, God imbued both w free will (which Geddy Lee chooses), so blame not the forked tongue of a polter-serp and give Eve credit where it’s due. Thank you for the expulsion, first mother; all the fucking ambrosia was starting to affect my allergies. (Award for Most Charismatic Satan in Literary History, to boot.)

385517072	By reading “Paradise Lost” I at last solved a problem for myself, but created a new one.THE PROBLEM SOLVEDOn a few previous occasions I’ve begun the poem, only to give up at best, after a couple of the twelve books. The reason being that I’d get to the end of a page of wonderful sound and rhythms, think “What have I just read?”, only to realise that while I’d read the words, I’d not taken any meaning from them. Reading it was like taking a mental slide across a sheet of ice. First time it happened when I was in my late teens, so I could dismiss panic about suffering early onset short-term memory problems. I’d try again, really concentrating very hard indeed with clenched teeth and buttocks. Progress this way was so slow and painful that I lost the will to read it, if not to live. So one of greatest poems in the English language (so I was assured by reliable sources) remained unread - for years.But this time I cracked it. Hurrah! First, I started taking a little pocket edition of Milton’s poems for an early morning walk in the local nature reserve and reading as I walked. Each time I got home from reading the pocket edition, I could then enjoy Blake’s illustrations in the large edition. Reading while walking is an old habit - and I’ve never yet crashed into a thing. A friend once commented that he’d watched me passing by his house, book in hand and heading straight for a post box. He confessed to being most disappointed when I’d stepped round it at the last moment, without stopping reading (So sorry to have disappointed him). Second, I read it aloud as I walked along. This may have disturbed local wild life, and had other early morning walkers on the brink of ringing for assistance, but at least the content came alive. Third, I ignored the fact that it was supposed to be “one of greatest poems in the English language” and read it simply as a story, and wow what a brilliantly told story.THE NEW PROBLEMI’ve now let myself in for yet a new diversion away from other intended reading. First, the poem was so good that I’ve only scratched the surface this time round (But that’s far better than sliding over the surface and making no mark on it) and need now to go back to enjoy the detail. This will probably now wait for a little while. Second, I unread on my Inklings bookshelf for years has been C. S. Lewis’ “Preface to Paradise Lost”. I’ve skimmed and dipped into parts of it because I like his writing, but I believe that introductions and prefaces should always be read after the book they are about, not before. That now means that it just has to come off the shelf – and immediately – to be enjoyed at last. Next time round with “Paradise Lost”, I might actually get round to commenting on the poem.
