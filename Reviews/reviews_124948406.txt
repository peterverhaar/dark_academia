7248251391	3.5 ⭐️ The definition of supporting women’s rights & women’s wrongsNot very thrilling, but it was the epitome of female rage - if you like books about women’s revenge & them being the serial killer, you should try this 🫡
3774877396	I think people who enjoyed the movie Promising Young Woman would also enjoy this book. I can see how the story would be cathartic for those looking to read about a woman killing a bunch of dudes who deserve it. I hate men as much as the next gal, but I personally need more depth from radical feminist stories other than “let’s kill men cuz they suck go girl power!” Vigilante justice can be fun, but I would have liked more nuance with discussing gender dynamics, rape culture, and seen the main character challenged more for a rewarding and thoughtful story.
3584251131	Holy shit I loved this. This book screams 'I Did Something Bad' by Taylor Swift, I've never read a book that gives off the same exact vibes of that song until I read this book. The writing is absolutely captivating and I loved the characters too.I think it's best to go into this book knowing little to nothing, as I did but if you need to know more, here's a general description of what this book is about: we follow a woman named Scarlett, who is an English professor at a college, and she's also a serial killer. She tracks down bad men who have done awful things and makes them pay. Meanwhile, we also follow Carly who is a freshman at the same college and she's slowly developing feelings for her roommate Allison. There was such a good plot twist halfway through the book that shocked me so much, I didn't see it coming at all. To make this book even better, there are many queer characters in this book as well, and I absolutely love seeing that representation in this genre. I absolutely loved Scarlett and Carly as characters, and I just had the best time reading this book. I've seen some people comparing this book to the show Killing Eve, which I can definitely see. I don't know if this would be considered dark academia or not but it all takes place on a college campus and has the best dark/sinister vibes, so I would say yes? I really loved this one, even more than I expected to. Scarlett is the baddest bitch and I LOVED reading about her.Btw, I pictured Katie Siegel from Haunting of Hill House as Scarlett while I was reading this and that made my experience a thousand times better.
4252225208	3 stars We get it. It’s a radical feminist with a revenge plot meets American Psycho - take on psychological thrillers, if the author screamed it in my face it would have been less obvious. The book had so much potential but ended up being an average read. Cliché really, and so on the nose with the men are trash rhetoric. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love feminist, bad bitch, confident intelligent women and their stories (the whole murder side of things notwithstanding) but I also like finesse and subtlety and the elegance that comes from introducing those two things into any piece of writing. The way this was written really dispelled any sense of trepidation or the suspense I would have expected in such a book. I didn’t feel the tense and ominous vibes which were to be expected from this. There wasn’t at least one decent male character apart from the gay couple, because of course being gay automatically excludes you from being a misogynist. (That’s the kind of logic that goes hand in hand with - I have a POC neighbour, so I can’t be racist) Also, the only healthy relationship a woman or man can find is again with a another woman or respectively man. I get that this book is very much about gender, but playing on stereotypes and overused TikTok sound bites really isn’t the way to go. I’m not really complaining about there not being at least one decent man in the story, I mean that was kinda the whole point - to show that there isn’t just one type of predator, every man can be one because of how they grew to think about and relate to women. Seeking validation by taking advantage (Alex), straight up taking without disguise (Tyler and Bash) or feeling entitled to us just because (Wes) - that being said, I think this absolute take didn’t do the book any favours. Scarlett’s character didn’t have as much depth as we were led to think it did. I would have wanted to explore her dark urges more. I found it an inconsistency the way she was portrayed to have “snapped” and that’s what led to her discovering she had a taste for “tit for tat” murderous justice. I felt like the author couldn’t decide if she was a woman who snapped or if she was a serial killer who needed the kill and her vigilante justice was a two for one deal - get rid of the bad guys and take care of the bloodlust. The parts of Scarlett thinking she really craved the murder was confusing because that’s straight up psychopath and has nothing to do with men per se. I knew the ending was gonna play out similarly to how it actually did, and that’s because if I were to explain it in movie terms - this wasn’t exactly an arthouse indie film but a new Netflix adaption (the title of the book provides its own tag line already) because Netflix knows how to capitalise on trends and social movements with commentary that is skin deep only - and such is the case with this book. It is a cliche and I wouldn’t have faulted it that much if it was tense, suspenseful and had me in knots turning the pages. The good: It had a few twists I didn’t predict. The feminist approach and commentary (even if my whole review was spent complaining about it and was about as subtle as a rocket take off) was timely and it did make a few really good points. The writing was ok, nothing to praise or complain about. That’s about it I guess.
3266355349	Well, this is How to Get Away with murder meets Unbelievable waltz with a little “13 reasons why” and we have kickass punisher/vigilante/ #metoo movement follower English professor Scarlett Clark: reminds us of Black Widow (she didn’t get married but the men should beware! Because she is ready to bring justice to the bullies, rapists, stalkers, weirdos!), a good kind of serial-punisher! Don’t worry, she doesn’t choose students to commit murders for her like Annalise Keating had done and help them to get away with it. She works alone and she chooses the real scumbags, the worst predators at her list. She’s committing these cold blooded murders for years and she really knows how not to get any attention and how to misguide the law officers: Never leaves a trace, DNA any clue, distorting the crime scenes and deceives the officers the nature of murders. Now she is working at the Gorman University and she already punished a rapist student by poisoning him and made the entire people think he killed himself. Now she is focused on her big prize: Professor Alex Kinnear, his pretentious nemesis, womanizer, cheater, stealing his colleagues’ longtime works and getting credit from them. But she’s in trouble because Dr. Mina Pierce, ex-wife of Alex starts her own investigation because she finds the suicide patterns at the campus so suspicious and she works on a list consisted of Scarlett’s most of the victims. Could she find any clue directly point at her? In the meantime, we’re introduced the second narrator: Carly Schiller, 18 years old, introvert, quirky, having problems with her dysfunctional family, hating her cheater dad, trying to keep her head above the water throughout her freshman year. She also attends Alex’s classes who encourages her creative writing and shows her friendly attention. Carly’s decision to lay low and live in the shadows changes when she find out her roommate Allison she had a long time crush was sexually assaulted at the party. Now it’s time for her sharpen her nails, clenching her fists and seeing red. She wants justice. Could the silent and shy girl turn into a mean avenger to help her roommate? In the middle of the book, there is a twist I saw it at the beginning but it is still good one. The way of the narrators’ stories’ interception is also well written, smart and satisfying. This book is about brave women who deserve better life and who fight for taking the control of her their destiny. Even though most of the characters seem like vicious, violent and having sociopathic tendencies, you find yourself chant for their cause because it could happen to you! It could happen to your best friend, your own child and any other woman whose lives were ruined by the lack of evidence and common hypocrisy at the justice system.Overall: Even though all the women characters at the book were a little terrifying and the method of their justice was a little argumentative, it was fast pacing, smart, entertaining , thought provoking reading with lovely queer representation. I’m giving my 4 brave, moving, riveting stars and looking forward to read more works of Layne Fargo! I couldn’t put this book down all night long!Special thanks to NetGalley and Gallery/Scout Press for sharing this unputdownable ARC with me in exchange my honest review.
3771495517	Promising Young Woman + Dexter with a little Killing Eve vibes
4354861643	This is my favorite book of the year so far.Reread Feb 2024. Loved it just as much if not more.
3946682735	this book went by so incredibly fast - i feel like it ended just minutes after i started. i read it one sitting as its the kind of story that glues your eyes to the page. every single character in this has something seriously wrong with them. theyre like a total car wreck - terrible, but you just cant look away from what they are doing, fascinated in horror. youre sympathetic to their situations, even. and it makes the story that much more compelling.with super fast pacing, devourable writing, messed up characters, and a dark academia setting that fits the tone perfectly, this is definitely one to pick up.↠ 4.5 stars
3430821887	“He wasn’t afraid of me…That was his first mistake.”They Never Learn is a dark and devious psychological thriller about a female professor who murders men who have committed unspeakable acts of abuse against women. Two women at Gorman University, one a student, the other a professor, are united in bringing down the perpetrators of sexual assault. Carly is a shy and awkward, college freshman. She is scared to open up and let people know the real her. Struggling to fit in, while at the same time trying to navigate the dynamics of a new friendship, she finds herself in the dangerous and unsettling territory.Scarlett is well-respected in her field, confident, and extremely intelligent. While others on campus remain silent about sexual assault and misconduct amongst students and faculty, Scarlett takes action and murders the men who are guilty of such crimes. Killing for her is an intense ritual that empowers, compels, and drives her. When someone starts to take a closer look at campus “suicides,” she begins to fear her crimes will be exposed. Scarlett and Carly’s stories are very different, and it is not obvious how they relate until about halfway into the book. At a certain moment, their stories converge and all becomes clear. Chapters alternate between Scarlett's and Carly's perspectives. The reader knows early on who Scarlett is and what she does, but we don’t know what motivates her. Her story reveals what led her to this point. Carly is a mess, and her story feels messy. But all comes together in the end. They Never Learn is a sharp, intense, and refreshing read. I loved Scarlett’s character. She is a killer, but it is easy to root for her. Her cold and calculating demeanor had me on edge. Watching how she usurps the power of those who have brutally taken the power of their victims was exhilarating. One should be horrified by Scarlett’s crimes, but given the acts her victims committed, watching them die was beyond satisfying. “Killing a man is so much more satisfying than fucking a man could ever be.”I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Gallery Books in exchange for an honest review.
3253449990	Hear ye, hear ye! This is my second novel by Layne Fargo and I think I've found a literary soul mate in her. It's so refreshing to find an author who isn't afraid to "go there", if you know what I mean. The premise behind They Never Learn is a modern classic; feminist serial killing told in a thrilling manner. The beauty of this story is that we know who is doing the killing at the beginning of the book, but we don't truly know what led her to it until the plot unravels in the second half. I think this move was BRILLIANT on Fargo's part; we still get all the chills and thrills associated with a creepy mystery, but the book isn't an automatic let down if you figure out the killer's identity early, because that factor is taken out of the equation. I don't want to say too much, but it takes awhile for us to figure out how Scarlett and Carly's paths are mingled together, and I loved seeing how everything unfolded. If you're looking for a novel that will have you wondering whether you relating to a serial killer makes you a psychopath as well, you've come to the right place. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.
3301554753	I knew by the 10% point that this would be a 5 star book for me!So, let's set the mood, so you can settle in for this "unputdownable" read!First, pour yourself a glass of ruby colored wine...🍷Then, get on YouTube and listen to the Karen Kamon song "Manhunt" from the classic 1983 film "Flashdance"-particularly the chorus...(if you don't already have the words memorized, as I do....)😳" I'm goin on a manhunt, turn it aroundWomen have been hunted, now they're huntin' aroundManhunt, we all got the needThe one that's been waitin' has taken the leadI'm goin' on a manhunt-I'm out for a kill! "Now, open your book, and meet Scarlett Clark, an exceptional English professor, with flaming red hair and an even more fiery temper! Every year she selects the WORST man on Gorman campus and meticulously plans his demise. Too bad, "They Never Learn" and keep repeating their mistakes!This song could've been written for Scarlett-and, I loved her!❤️But, she isn't the only one at Gorman who has had enough of the male species there. When Carly Schiller's roommate, Allison is sexually assaulted at a party, she too, becomes obsessed with making someone pay. Although Scarlett's chapters were definitely my favorite, Carly's are engaging too.The narratives alternate, the pace is fast, and the humor is snarky! (my favorite kind!)But one woman, may have just gotten sloppy, putting her secret life at risk of exposure..If you miss the HBO show-Dexter, or enjoyed "My Lovely Wife", Jane Doe (#1), Best Day Ever, or "The Other Mrs. Miller”- then this one is for you!! A big Thank You to the publisher, Gallery/Scout Press for the digital ARC!It was a pleasure to post a candid review! AVAILABLE TUESDAY!! OCT.13th, 2020HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY!!❤️
3428247062	A dark and twisted psychological thriller, about two women who enjoy giving bad men what they deserve...Scarlett is an English professor at Gormon University. She is also a serial killer, a vigilante doling out punishment to the rapists and the abusers of the world. Her life is fine, until the university starts looking into the er..large body count on campus! Anxious and enraged, she loses control with her latest victim and puts everything at risk.Carly, a first year student at Gormon, begins an intense friendship with her enigmatic and confident roommate, Allison. When Allison is assaulted at a party, Carly wants the attacker to pay.Wow, holy shit, I was rivetted to this book, and stayed up way too late to finish it! So much drama! So much fun! This was the feminist serial killer story, that I didn't know I needed!Obviously there are trigger warnings for sexual assault in here, and all kinds of violence! So take care!A fast paced book, with a dual POV, which worked really well, They Never Learn was brutal, shocking and gripping, but also had elements of snarky humour thrown in too! It was entertaining, clever and so well written. I could feel the rage radiating off the page, and raged myself at the injustices of young women being dismissed, victimised and failed by the system! Even though the murdering of men was obviously horrifying, and totally wrong, it was also quite satisfying to read about because those men were truly awful! I'm not going to lie, Scarlett was a cold blooded sociopath, and she terrified me! I would not want to meet her in person AT ALL! Buuuut... I kinda liked her as a fictional character, and totally wanted her to get away with it! Some of the characters in TNL were very violent, vindictive and vicious, but I couldn't help rooting for them. In their own way, they were fighting for justice, for women who were assaulted and abused. Strong, and yet dangerous, I was half captivated, half horrified by them! There were also characters who I hated with every fibre of my being, may they rot in hell!I half suspected the twist, but then was thrown off by some red herrings! When the twist happened I was like arrghh, I was right the first time, before you tricked me Layne Fargo!! Thrown off the scent, after being spot on, it didn't deter me from the story, as there were so many more twists to come!There was also some great on page bisexual and gay representation!Towards the end of They Never Learn, the plot and the characters got even more disturbing and unhinged, but I kind of went with the crazy, and then ultimately the ending felt satisfying for me!I definitely need to get my hands on Layne Fargo's debut,Temper, and will be looking out for her next book with eager, grabby little hands! I would definitely recommend this for a wild, entertaining, and vengeful story, if you're in the mood for something disturbing, and yet exhilarating! 🔪☠️🔥☠️🔪 (4.5 Stars)Available 13th October 2020!Many thanks to Edelweiss and to Simon and Schuster for my DRC, in exchange for an honest review!------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well I just stayed up to almost midnight to finish this book, I'll be tired tomorrow, but I have no regrets!

From there on, the plot just kept surprising me. In a good way. It’s not exactly what it seems it might be at first.Although I don’t agree with revenge seeking these days (😉), this is just the right mix of campy social commentary and revenge violence to work for me. I was able to view it as a cautionary tale of what could happen if we don’t start working to solve the academia culture that breeds violence against women. There are certain moments when the tide could have been turned if someone, anyone, had listened to the violated women. To me, this is what the takeaway from the book really is supposed to be.For me, the queer content was delightful. There are multiple bisexual women characters. There are even multiple coming out stories present in the book.I read this in audiobook format, and the narration of both voices was well done. It was easy to tell them apart but also not jarring to switch back and forth. I also thought both actresses did a solid job with accents.A quick content warning that sexual assault, violence and murder are all described on-screen in this book.Overall, the plot compelled and surprised me, and the characters were engaging with multiple different bisexual women present. A delightful addition to the thriller genre.
3639766884	“Killing a man is so much more satisfying than fucking a man could ever be.” Why. You clearly haven’t been properly f*cked. I don’t know if I should pity you for that or applaud you for your proclivity to kill.A feminist serial killer story?Hmm, more like strike the feminist and replace it with misandrist. 👀 Granted my knowledge on these two concepts, terms, ideology or whatever is very limited, so it could be that I took this book the wrong way and was missing the point. But Idk . . .I did not vibe with this book. Scarlett is an English professor. She’s also a part time serial killer. Unfortunately, she might have to take a break or retire from that career path because the school (where she teaches, hunts, and kills) starts getting suspicious of the growing body count found on campus and opens up an investigation.Then there’s Carly, who’s an awfully shy freshman student of the same university. She roomates with this cool chick Allison and overtime develops feelings for her. So when Allison is sexually assaulted at a party, Carly makes it her mission to be . . . obsessed with (the idea of) making the offender pay.How do you think their stories will connect?✤ Women feeling empowered by bringing (bad) men down.(view spoiler)[I guess this is okay if the men really do have it coming. However, the fact that there isn’t a single decent male character in this book is a bit much. I get that the book is trying to show that, be it a stranger or someone whom you trust and think is your friend, you have to be careful (still) because predators could be anyone. But makin’ them all predators? That’s just . . . tragic and makes me feel hopeless. Why can’t we at least have one who’s an ALLY? It seems like the book is overgeneralizing. (hide spoiler)]✤ The mystery is that this book doesn’t have one.Am I the only one who thinks that plot twist is not a plot twist at all? Cause like, well, duh! That’s so obvious.✤ Romanticized ending (??)(view spoiler)[I feel like the ending fits more in a romance book. How come we glorified this serial killer as some sort of savior or superhero? I don’t want her representating us ladies or me specifically. How can you adore someone who kills? Also, like how bad is the offense should be until you decide that person deserves the kill? How is killing those perverts solve the problem?I’m all for women empowerment, but not at the expanse of someone else. I may not need a man, but that doesn’t mean I wish them going extinct or anything. 😂 Honestly, girl, stay on your lane and mind your own business! If you want to help, I don’t think being the judge, jury, executioner is the answer. Why am I so riled up about this?! LOL. Anyway, I’d rather get an ambiguous ending than this . . . happily ever after. (hide spoiler)]✤ The writing, or whatever’s making the tension and thrill nonexistent.When you’re listening to a thriller book on audio and still be able to multitask without feeling distracted by one or the other, that’s not a good sign. At least not in my case. This book went by me quickly and didn’t make me feel. I don’t think Scarlett was a badass. She didn’t make me want to understand and try to justify her behavior and root for her.Bottom line,That’s my impression on this book. Kinda icky. Didn’t dislike it but also not 100% sold.

4469861867	Actual rating: 3,5They Never Learn was on my tbr for some time now and with all honesty, my expectations were high as skyscraper.I loved the book at first, really enjoyed the main character(s) and the writing style that was so easy to follow and that read fast.The book is written in first person so connecting with Scarlet or Carly was no problem, and, to me, the length of the chapters was plain perfect.However, as the story was coming closer to the end, I started to disconnect from the characters and to me, the writer was too extreme with her feminism propaganda.I get that there are awful men out there. Damn, I know it from first hand.I get that the book is written from MC's POV, and her view on men is the one we get but still, not every single breathing man is the rapist, chauvinist, career stealer...The author ruined one particular character for shock value, the other got punished because of main character's fear of men (and hatred for them), and I don't appreciate it.As I said to my reading friends (this book was our book club pick for January), nothing good comes from too extreme points of view. The ending was like the one from the cheap tv movie that aires on Monday afternoon, disappointing and cringey.This novel had potential to be a 4 stars read for me, but the last three chapters + epilogue ruined it for me.Especially the epilogue with boss babes that are so cool and very hypocritical. I mean, if a man did all those things Scarlett did, her love interest would run away as fast as she could.Sorry, not sorry for my honesty. If you don't agree with me that is okay, we are all different here. I am open for discussions but rude comments that question my intelligence, or similar to those, will be deleted.
3321588150	4-LETTER WORD + ING AWESOME!A female vigilante serial killer. One who makes her own final justice on behalf of women that have been abused, assaulted and raped. She's gotten away with killing bad men for over a decade! Until now, as she makes a rash decision and comes as close as she's ever been to being caught.Absolutely loved this revenge filled story with a strong confident female lead. It was compelling, intelligent and well written. The story telling was excellent and used 2 alternating POVs, which helped the author deliver a fabulous job of character development. 4.5 stars! *Thank you to Simon & Schuster via Edelweiss+ for providing a digital review copy!
3265814064	HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!!If men could learn the error of their ways, I wouldn’t have to teach so many of them a lesson.in the wake of the #metoo movement, the bookmarket has been flooded by nonfiction accounts written by survivors of sexual assault and empowerment fiction about girls fighting back against predatory men, with or without supernatural assistance. inevitably, with trend-surges like these, some of ‘em are great, some are trite, and some get lost or overlooked in the crowd because of reader-fatigue (on a not unrelated note: the literary community needs to come to terms with the fact that WWII has been amply covered and give it a rest for at least five years). sobutanyway, what i’m saying is don’t overlook this one, because it’s a blast. sure, the message is unhealthy AF, with its ‘kill all the bad boys’ revenge attitude, but as a sink-into-it book about a sociopathic murderess on a mission, it’s fantastic—fast-flowing and gripping, full of intrigue and flawed characters. bonus: i did not at all anticipate the seam where its two stories met, and it was delicious. it was a rare-for-me-these-days single-day read, and i liked it even more than her debut, Temper. the two books share the same kind of pleasantly unexpected and somewhat unhinged endings, but in nearly every other way, they are complete opposites, particularly in matters of the sisterhood, and that’s all i can say about that here. fargo’s on a roll, and i’m here with my grabby little hands for whatever she’s cooking up next.come to my blog!

I put my trust in others and ended up enjoying this book that I never would have picked up on my own. What I liked most about They Never Learn - besides the clever title and twist that totally surprised me - was the stellar character arcs. Especially Carly. That girl needed a literal chill pill, she had so much angst and anxiety. But watching her grow and change through the book was awesome and so well written. I will say this though - I 𝙙𝙤 𝙣𝙤𝙩 agree with the ending. I thought and hoped things would turn out differently.

3282851034	HAPPY PUPLICATION DAY to one of my favorite thrillers of the year!“A smile spreads across my lips, even colder than the snow. You’re next, motherf***er.”I couldn’t help but hoot as I read this line in the EXCELLENT, unputdownable murder thriller THEY NEVER LEARN. Scarlett is a college professor who kills men at the University she teaches at...men who, in her mind, deserve it for doing terrible things to women. Everything is fine until her latest kill spins wildly out of control and causes more people to probe into the deaths at the college. In alternating chapters, Carly is a freshman at the university who quickly becomes friendly with her roommate, Allison, her total opposite. Allison likes to go out, drink, flirt, and generally have a good time. After Allison is sexually assaulted at a party, Carly can’t stop her dark thoughts of making the attacker pay for what he’s done. This book is bloody, violent, somewhat disturbing, and extremely entertaining. I was blown away by author Layne Fargo’s ability to etch out the characters so well and keep me intrigued at every chapter. There’s plenty of unsuspecting twists that tie everything together, and you will not want to stop reading as you get deeper and deeper into this dark story. This surpasses Fargo’s debut novel, TEMPER, by far. Thank you to Gallery/Scout Press, Layne Fargo, and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

3538142026	*Many thanks to Edelweiss, Gallery/Scout, and Layne Fargo for a DRC in exchange for an honest review! Now available as of 10.13.20, also now in paperback!* Devious, sinister, and COMPLETELY breathtaking!Scarlett Clark is not simply your average fiery-haired, sharp-witted English professor. Coupled with this persona, Scarlett's true passion is dispensing justice to the men who truly 'deserve it'. And how does she accomplish this vigilante justice? She meticulously plots, plans, and commits their murders, of course! And Scarlett's fiendish plans all have a common goal: to rid the world of men who just won't listen, and who just can't say no. Beginning with her small campus community, Scarlett finds example after nauseating example of men who can't respect the word 'no'...or who just can't respect the power of a woman, period. When she sets her sights on a fellow professor, however, can she keep her murderous exploits under wraps, while still saving her fellow females from the men brimming with toxic masculinity?Meanwhile, we are introduced to awkward freshman Carly, new at Gorman and aching to find a place for herself in a new community, far from the drama between her parents at home. She is immediately enchanted by her lovely roommate Allison, who imbues her with the confidence to begin to explore her sexuality. The two form a deepening connection and after Allison reveals to Carly that she is bisexual, Carly's feelings begin to blossom. However, her jealousy flares as she realizes that Allison's eyes are focused on the wrong sort of guy--which comes to fruition at a party where Allison is the unwitting victim of sexual assault. Carly is enraged and desperate to make the perpetrator pay...but how will she find a way to not just ask for, but DEMAND the justice she craves?I went into this book with incredibly high expectations...and they were blown to ABSOLUTE smithereens! Scarlett was a captivating and deliciously dangerous narrator from page one. I felt her rage coursing through my veins and was as eager for her to commit the murders as she was to get away with them! Which completely speaks to Fargo's ability to throw you into the mind of a psychopath and to make their train of thought seem not only plausible, but actually practical! This is the sort of stunning page-turner I wish every thriller was---explosive and still quiet, and just BEYOND clever. The first twist hits at about 40% and it is shocking, surprising, and so intelligently done I was still reeling, pages later. While I was still frantically reading, I kept coming back to execution (of the story in this case) mentally and I just could not get over how beautifully Fargo pulled off the twist...and that is only the FIRST twist! From that point on, particularly, I was completely hooked, utterly, engrossed, and fighting for every last second of free time I could squeeze out of my day so I could just get through one more chapter! Trust me when I say this would be the PERFECT book for a cold autumn night, a glass (or maybe a bottle) of fantastic wine, and perhaps a sinister fire crackling in the hearth for atmosphere. You won't need these added elements, because this book is that much of an atmospheric experience in and of itself, but will only make it better. This is one of those books I wish I could unread just so I could experience it again for the first time. I would give this book 10 stars if I could, and considering we are now far more than halfway through the year, that this book will undoubtedly be on the top ten of my list for 2020's best thrillers. Fargo is beyond brilliant, and has hit it out of the park with this one! 5 ⭐️
3584809892	Well, well, well, what do we have here?????Scarlett Clark is an English Professor by day and a woman who murders men who she feels deserve it by night. Just when she is preparing for her biggest kill yet, the college begins to investigate the growing number of "suicides" on campus.Carly Schiller is trying to survive freshman year. She wants to dive into her studies but her roommate who enjoys breaking the rules has other plans. As the roommates becomes closer, Carly becomes obsessed with making the young man who sexually assaulted her roommate at a party pay for his actions.Grab a seat, buckle yourself in and enjoy this dark twisted ride! This was a fast, fun and captivating read. We are not supposed to root for the killer, are we? That would be so wrong, but it feels so right. So how do these two storylines relate? Will they merge? Did you see the connection coming? My hand is waving in the air, I figured that little bit out, but it did not affect my enjoyment of this book at all. This was bloody good. A real killer of a book! A riveting not-to-be-missed book!Thank you to Gallery/Scout Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.

3595139318	tw: rape, physical and sexual assault, victim blaming "They never see the murder in my eyes." Basically, the story is told into two perspectives (again, duh.), Dr. Scarlett Clarke and Carly Schiller. Scarlett seems like this Anne Hathaway's Catwoman; appears to be this your ordinary English professor at Gorman University but in reality she is a serial killer. She is insatiable in killing men, both faculty and student, who are to be believed as rapists, wife beaters, etc etc. For 16 years, she has gotten away from murder until something happened. On the other hand, we have Carly Schiller, the shy awkward freshman in the said university. Everything is fun and light to her as she embraces her college life until something happened... "No way. Only someone with serious mental problems could write something like that.""Yeah?" My fist closes around the pages. "Well, only someone with massive daddy issues could write the shit you do, Mallory." Her mouth snaps shut, eyes already filling with tears. Three books comes into mind when I started reading this: Samantha Downing's My Lovely Wife, Megan Goldin's The Night Swim and Rainbow Rowell's Fangirl. Man, I was so excited to read this and then it turned out to be an 'okay' read for me. The downside, as for me, would be the alternating point of views of Scarlett and Carly. Usually, I don't really mind reading a story with multiple perspectives but for some reason I did mind in this one. I wasn't really full blown drawn into any of them despite their own tragedies that they carry. Also, there was this clear imbalance between them with respect to thrill, suspense and mystery. For the earlier half I was leaning more into Scarlett and how her mind works, but hers just feels so tiring and repetitive. And then the romance kicked in and I was like 'Eh. Do we really need this? In the middle of all of these?' For Carly's, there was indeed a struggle in the beginning. Her earlier chapters felt more YA-ish to me. I only got invested in it when something sinister happened. "It's exhausting, being in my head. I wish I could stop thinking. I wish I could be like everyone else." There was this one twist I wish and hope the author handled differently. I'm not mad about it because it made me gasp I just knew and I liked to be proven right. My concern is that after learning it, everything seems to clicked in already. Everything made sense. All the pieces of the puzzle started to put themselves together in my head. It eliminated this good potential plot twist that would make me more invested in the story. "You're a psychotic bitch!"My mouth curves up in a smile. "Yes, I am." On a positive note, Layne Fargo's writing style was very easy to fly through. Very direct and no words over describing things. As a reader you could just feel the emotions, the anger and the hopelessness of our characters. Some parts of this novel made my skin crawl and I'm not talking about the killings. Overall again this is an okay read for me. It was interesting all through out. My mind was reeling on how all of these will turn out in the end. I think I would love this more only maybe if there's a little bit heart into it and not just this repetitive cycle of vengeance. As of Scarlett's motives of course, you can never extinguish a fire with another fire but the satisfaction in my lips were very hard to remove.
4451093199	Rating ⭐⭐⭐.5~ Quick Summary ~Scarlett (female Dexter) is a professor and in her spare time kills men who get away with their crime. Carly, a shy and introverted student adjusts to her new life on campus away from her abusive father. She witnessed her best friend’s sexual assult and wants nothing more than revenge. ~ Pick this up if you enjoy/don’t mind the following ~📕 Quick and easy to read chapters🏃 Medium pace but not much tension 👩 Morally grey protagonist but lacks depth🎓 University Setting🧑‍🤝‍🧑 2 POV, a professor and a student which was slightly YA~ What I Enjoyed ~- There are 2 very different POVs, a professor and a student and I was surprised how they converged. - The chapters were short and easy to read. - I liked the idea of Scarlett because I love morally grey characters! ~ What I didn’t Enjoy ~- The message I got loud and clear with a speaker phone to my ear is that all men are dirtbags. Maybe except for gay men. Seriously, the majority of the men were sleazebags which was overkill!!! (view spoiler)[The final straw was when Wes turned about to be a bad one, I just thought it was a joke (hide spoiler)]. - The characters didn’t have as much depth or complexity as I would have liked. I wish there was more around Scarlett’s dark thoughts/urges and Carly’s troubles. I feel like it wasn’t fleshed out much. We know that their character/personality stems from certain issues and events but I feel like I was just told what happened and then had to simply accept that this is the way they are now. - Although this was an entertaining read, at the same time I didn’t feel much tension and was never at the edge of my seat. - The ending was incredibly cliche, something I would expect out of a romance novel. - This wasn’t as dark as I would have liked.

3332201723	"He wasn't afraid of me. That was his first mistake"First of many, I would say...As I sat here reflecting about "They never learn" to write this review, empathizing once again with a sociopath, I couldn't help but wonder: am I a socipath myself?Either because of my (alledged) sociopathic tendencies or because of this current trend with stories with very well written socio characters, I enjoyed this one a lot. Yes, I know, murder and violence are not the answer, but it was so satisfaying seeing these pricks get their comeuppance.Meet Scarlett Clark. A Gorman University English proffesor by day, murderer extraordinaire by night. But she only kills men who well deserve it so, YOU GO, GIRL! As Annalise Keating, she's been getting away with murder for 16 years but, as she gets too personal in her latest killing, her secret life is at risk of exposure.Carly Schiller, a freshman at Gorman University, is trying to survive her first year, forming a very intense friendship with her new roommate Allison, but when she is sexually assaulted, Carly takes upon herself to make her friend's attacker pay.In the author's bio it is said that Layne Fargo writes thrillers about angry women. I wouldn't say they're angry but fed up of dealing with despicable guys who think they can do whatever they want to them without any repercusions so, after not getting any help from the institutions and those in a position of power that are suppose to provide justice for them, they decide to take matter in their own hands. With several enraging scenes I think the one that really made my blood boil was the one in the dean's office. So disgusting!Halfway through there was a twist that, even though I called it despite the red-herrings thrown around, it served to tie both characters lines perfectly.Dark and twisted tale of revenge, cleverly written, with some dark humor thrown around, that will make you root for a killer cause, even though you know it's wrong, it feels so right.If you like your books with strong female characters taking no nonsense, this is the one for you.
3513460801	I'm impressed the author managed to come up with a dark and disturbing story but one that also was fun to read. You almost feel guilty for eagerly wanting to see everything unfold. Highly recommend this book for fans of Dexter.Scarlett Clark is an English professor at Gorman University. She also is a murderer. If a man commits sexual assault but gets away with it, Scarlett makes sure he pays... with his life. But she has a bit of a problem on her hands as now a formal investigation is underway into all those mysterious campus deaths. Carly Schiller is a freshman at Gorman. Growing up in an emotionally abusive household might be part of the reason she is a bit of a loner. Her roommate Allison encourages Carly to go out more and the two strike up a friendship.What I loved most about this book is it had a good "why didn't I see that coming?" type of moment. Kudos to the author as I always enjoy being caught off guard. I also liked how the chapters alternated between Scarlett and Carly as it led to a nice pace for the story.I do have some mixed feelings about the ending. While it was better than what many authors might have come up with, it also felt convenient. There's a ton of action in those final chapters but yet it didn't really wow me. And because I was feeling a bit disappointed, the climatic scenes didn't pack much of a punch. Not a bad ending, but not awesome either.Overall though this is a story worth checking out if you like the genre. I'm definitely interested in reading other books by this author.I won a free copy of this book in a Goodreads giveaway. All thoughts expressed are my honest opinion.
3365147905	Heck yes, Fargo!!! That is how you write a thriller! You have completely redeemed yourself in my book, after I very much so disliked your debut novel, Temper. This read was like night and day for me from Temper - I struggled through it, and eventually gave up and DNF'd it at about 90% complete, while I was completely absorbed in this novel, and couldn't get enough of it. I ate this up like my favorite dessert in the world, tiramisu, and I wanted seconds - I need to know how this story continues, as it was left very open-ended, almost as though it might even have a sequel, kind of like Caroline Kepnes's You & Hidden Bodies. Who doesn't enjoy an evil, yet likable narrator? I know I do, and most likely always will. Fargo executes this trope in excellent fashion, jumping from past back to the present. There was a decent twist about half-way through this tale that I should have seen, yet found shocking, and the rest of the story was told in such a fast pace I could barely recover before it was over! This second novel is proof to me that you cannot judge an author completely on their debut, and it's worth investing a couple reads into an author before giving them a pass, or in this case, becoming a HUGE fan! I cannot wait to see what kind of delectable tail Fargo will publish next!

3787500779	I hate saying something is overrated because I don't want to insult how anyone feels about what they read; to each their own. But this book is overrated till the cows come home. I don't know what's up with the thriller genre, but—it's like I've read so many it's hard to find a good one anymore. Or perhaps I'm more critical now than I was in the past. Anyway, the book reads like a simplistic young adult novel; even the adult characters felt YA. I felt zero connection to them. The only bonus was the short chapters. I finished in no time at all.

5504254351	Scarlett Clark, a much loved English professor at Gorman University, has had a side gig in murder for years. One by one, she tracks down men she deems guilty of unspeakable crimes and makes them pay the ultimate price. So far, she’s gotten away with every death cleanly by making them all appear to be either suicides or accidents. But as she turns her attention to her most challenging target yet, she fears that this time may be her undoing.It seems that the unprecedented number of suicides have finally caught the eye of university officials and an investigation has been initiated. Hoping to control what they uncover, Scarlett works her way onto the task force looking into the deaths and squarely into the sights of psych professor Dr. Mina Pierce who is heading it up. A woman who seems to be far more canny than the bumbling town police. Should Scarlett be worried? Or can she manipulate her as well?Meanwhile, Carly Schiller is a freshman at Gorman University, finally out of her emotionally abusive father’s home. Used to being the kind of girl easily overlooked and ignored, she is delighted when her stunning and outgoing roommate, Allison, takes her under her wing. Overnight, Carly finds herself with a new best friend that others flock to be around.One night at a party, Carly walks in to find her newfound friend being sexually assaulted. Determined to make him pay, she insists on helping Allison through the tricky landscape. But when she sees nothing happening, her frustration turns to anger. Day after day, she watches her friend suffering while the perpetrator gets off scot-free. Surely, she of all people can find a way to balance the scales. One way or the other.If you’re looking for your next favorite novel that centers deliciously around a feminist serial killer, They Never Learn is the book for you! Fast-paced, addictive, and outright riveting, it’s the perfect kind of story to give you the ride of your life. Heck, it would even beat a reading slump!Right off the bat, my favorite aspect of this delicious tale was Scarlett Clark herself. A thoroughly evil character that I couldn’t help but root for, her cold, calculating ways were oddly endearing. After all, she knew who she was and embraced it wholeheartedly, turning her life over to avenging bad men who get away with vile acts. What self-respecting woman wouldn’t cheer her on? At least in the guise of a fictional book. Wink wink.Following up a close second were the absolutely mind-blowing, breathtaking twists that literally made me gasp out loud. While one truly turned the whole story on its head, those that followed also didn’t disappoint in the least. And none of them were even remotely predictable to this armchair sleuth. So bravo, Ms. Fargo!Last but certainly not least was the truly brilliant storyline which was told in two alternating POVs. Well-written and beautifully organized, the twists were concealed perfectly which could not have been easy. And, while the climax got a little hairy for a while with ever more disturbing characters, it led to an altogether satisfying ending that made me close the book with a smile on my face.All said and done, I had an absolute blast riding shotgun with these two women out for blood against men behaving badly. Dark and chilling but equally filled with snarky humor, I flew through this book in just under a day. Now I can’t wait to grab a copy of Fargo’s debut novel Temper ASAP. I just loving finding new top-notch authors, don’t you? Rating of 5+ stars.Trigger warning: being roofied, attempted rape, grooming, mention of: stalking, infidelity, emotional abuse
4571889273	Rated 2.5/5 stars
6098884014	You know what. I really liked this. I’m not going to lie, the first half I was having a good time but I wasn’t sure what I felt about our main character, Scarlett Clark. I mean- sure… she’s eliminating men who are disgusting, vile, evil men… but I wanted to love her as a character… and I struggled with that in the beginning because she was pretty unlikeable… UNTIL…. The second half… when the story really reveals itself. I’m on board Dr Clark… I get it. This was a fun revenge story, with short chapters and a propelling plot. Lots of fun. Great first read of 2024!
6057513381	i love female serial killers who get their revenge and get away with it. thats all. 100000/10
4407768248	3.25 stars But little do they know: killing a man is so much more satisfying than fucking a man could ever be. Fast pacing, major “good for her” vibes, and a vigilant twisted heroine. An interesting read for sure, but it just didn’t completely do it for me. My main complains are that Scarlet’s character just lacked depth. I wanted to know more about her, to understand her motives and all of that. Also, the twists weren’t really there. I easily figured them all out from the beginning. This wasn’t a bad book at all, it was definitely interesting and fast to read, it just didn’t keep me hooked and at some point I kinda stopped caring.
4351009356	Absolutely loved this thriller. Rtc once I’ve had my book club meeting lol. Highly recommend it!
3588101931	3.5.There's a serial killer loose on an East Coast campus!Her name is Scarlett Clark. She's an English Professor at Gorman University, and she's been killing men for years, and no one is any the wiser. The men she targets are guilty of crimes against women – voyeurism, sexual harassment, domestic violence, rape – but they have never been held accountable for their crimes, so it falls on Scarlett to punish the guilty. Because, in her eyes, men like that don't deserve to live.Carly Schiller is an introverted, shy Freshman at Gorman. That is, until she makes friends with her dorm roommate, Allison, and starts to come out of her shell. But when Allison is drugged and assaulted at a Fraternity Party, Carly is desperate to help her friend seek justice. And, Scarlett is just the women for the job.They Never Learn was fun escapism but not as good as I thought it was going to be. I expected that it was going to be far-fetched because ‘revenge’ stories of this type normally are, but the last half progressively became just too ridiculous and unbelievable for my taste. I admit black comedy is a bit ‘hit’ or ‘miss' for me though. I'm a huge fan of Dexter and Samantha Downing’s and John Marrs’ brand of twisted, but They Never Learn wasn't on the same level. Aside from the mind-blowing opening chapter (the first line sent shivers down my spine), nothing much happened during the first 150 odd pages.The other unfortunate thing was that I figured out the biggest twist. It was a good one, but because I've read two books that did the same thing, I saw where this one was going. Although, I admit the author was fantastic at misdirection and I did start to doubt myself a couple of times. Maybe I've just read too many psychological thrillers? I hope not, because I do love them.An enjoyable read, but I wish (like many others) I had of loved it more.PS: I just noticed the original title was intended to be ‘Learn Her Wrath'. Glad they changed it, as ‘They Never Learn' is brilliant.
3587906116	Easily one of the most binge worthy books of 2020. I was hesitant to pick up Layne Fargo's They Never Learn because her debut and I didn't end on a good note, but this is literally proof that you should always read a book that catches your eye, regardless of prior experience with the author. I could not put this book down at all and read it in two sittings. The story is everything that I would want in a female Dexter spin off—a feminist, queer, protagonist; coming for the throats of terrible, abusive men. With a story alternating between two storylines, we are introduced to Scarlett Clark, professor by day, man murdering machine by night. I really want you to go in without knowing anything else in the story, because I actually think that the story develops in such a profound way and reading the synopsis could spoil it for you. Perfect for Halloween, perfect for thriller fans, and perfect for all those who are ready to make a jump into the thriller genre. While not unnecessarily gory, the story does dive into topics such as rape, murder, and violent crime; so go into the novel knowing that.Layne Fargo, I cannot wait to see what you come up with for your next book because I am a fan!
3441996612	I am immensely grateful to the bookish community (Jayme, I’m looking at you in particular) for sending this book recommendation my way, because this was exactly the type of book I love: a story about a kick-ass, unscrupulous woman character seeking her own kind of justice – or revenge? Borderline sociopathic, fearless, intelligent and driven, this type of character will steer you through the rough seas of a wonderfully twisted tale, and it delivered all that and more.If you love twisted, kick-ass women characters like Lily out of THE KIND WORTH KILLING, Jane from JANE DOE or Zoey out of THE RED HUNTER, then you will feel immediately drawn to Scarlett Clark, an English professor with a deep dark secret she isn’t afraid to share with her readers. Just make sure you buckle up for the ride she is about to take you on! I am hoping that it says more about Fargo’s skill as a writer than my own suppressed psychopathic tendencies that I was on Scarlett’s side the whole time and was hoping she would get away with the special brand of justice she is doling out. Does it take a certain lack of moral fibre to root for such an obviously disturbed character? Or is it the exact opposite, that the kind of tale Scarlett tells awakens our inner craving for justice? Justice, or revenge? This would make for a great debate with a reading group! But let’s not get too deep here. THEY NEVER LEARN was a compulsive dark tale from beginning to end and had me totally in its grip. It’s cleverly constructed, rolling out in two seemingly unrelated narratives that seamlessly come together somewhere near the middle of the book, at which point you may sigh, as I did: “Ah, yes, I can see it now!”I appreciated the way the author fearlessly presents her twisted main character, unapologetic for the rising body count, and quickly gets her readers on her side. Scarlett is the type of successful, intelligent woman many of us may aspire to be, except for – oops – she is also a serial killer. And not ashamed to admit it. But does that make her any less likeable – no, Sir! And, Sir, you may do well to stay on her good side! Was I scared of her? Hell, yes! But if you have ever witnessed the slow grindings of the justice system, especially for vulnerable women, then you may also feel a small satisfactory glow at her own brand of justice.My only small quibble was that Carly’s story could have been trimmed a little bit in parts to make the otherwise fast paced story flow a bit better. I admit that at times I was much more invested in Scarlett’s story than Carly’s, especially after the cliffhangers in Scarlett’s later chapters that had me reading the whole book in one massive sitting. Will Scarlett get away with her latest murder? Did I want her to – yes, yes, yes I did! Don’t judge me too harshly though, because once in Scarlett’s world, you may feel exactly the same.All in all, THEY NEVER LEARN was the type of compulsive, twisted, entertaining tale that doesn’t come around very often. Fast paced and led by a strong female lead, it gripped me after the first page and didn’t let up until I had finished it. With its atmospheric boarding college setting and characters that all elicited a strong emotional response, I was totally swept away on one heck of a journey. Thank you to Edelweiss and Gallery / Scout Press for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog* *facebook* *instagram*
4712039870	They Never Learn was a damn good novel! WOW! Here’s a quote that perfectly depicts the vibe of this book: “Killing a man is so much more satisfying than fucking a man could ever be.”
3310729900	Happy Publication Day to one of my favorite thrillers this year! Available now.Wow, this was an awesome read. In the beginning I thought this was gonna be a solid, four star type read. I am definitely here for a Professor Lady Dexter who brings rapists to justice. (Not a spoiler - this is how the book STARTS!) Then there was also a female antagonist (who would normally be the protagonist, were I inclined to want our friend the professor caught), a male lover who might have a little more going on than meets the eye, and an alternate narrator who is a nice girl just trying to get through her first year of college.But then came the first of many awesome twists which made this book way more special than I was expecting from this genre thriller. The book has some legitimately shocking surprises and twists that are so well-executed and surprising without being unfair to the reader. This book has a little something to say about sexual harassment but it does it in a really entertaining, scary and gripping way. Most of all though this book is entertaining as hell. Tons of twists, but none are wrong for the story or forced. I could not have predicted the ending and I LOVED it. A perfect feminist suspense novel and revenge thrill ride for the #MeToo era. Also, Fargo is adapting this for TV. So get onboard and read the book because soon this is gonna be an even better “You” with an even more interesting narrator. (Apologies to Joe. Still love ya, Joe, but Scarlett would take you DOWN.)Thanks to NetGalley, Layne Fargo and Simon and Schuster for the early copy of this awesome book, one of my favorite thrillers of the year. I also really enjoyed Temper, but I think this one is going to be Fargo’s breakthrough hit.
3303869605	A dark and twisted tale, They Never Learn by Layne Fargo is just brilliant. It’s a raw psychological/crime thriller that will keep readers up at night as they devour a story about two women who give bad men exactly what they deserve.Meet Scarlett Clarke, English professor at Gorman University. For 16 years she has kept a very dark secret. She is a killer. But not just any killer. Scarlett, in the vein of Dexter, kills bad men. She finds men who think they can get away with treating women badly. And once she identifies her next target, she stalks them, she gets to know their schedule better than they do, and she plans their murder down to the smallest detail. And she has never been caught.This is also the story of Carly Schiller, a first-year student at the same university. She’s a shy, bookish girl who struggles to fit in and make friends. Now that she’s away from home, she can put her emotionally abusive father in the rear-view mirror and focus on her studies. Except that her new roommate isn’t on the same page. Still, university life is an eye opener for Carly, and will change her life forever.How these two characters of Scarlett and Carly intertwine becomes clear about halfway through. Two very different women with strong feelings.They Never Learn is very twisted in all the right ways, just as it’s funny and it’s completely addictive. Crime lovers will fly through this book just like I did. Easily all the stars and one of the best books I’ve read in 2020. I am off to get myself a copy of Layne’s first book, Temper now.Thanks so much to Gallery/Scout Press and NetGalley for my copy of this book to read. All opinions are my own and are in no way biased.Review first published Murder and Suspense https://www.mysteryandsuspense.com/re...
4363921489	It takes a lot for a thriller to get five stars from me, but this book fully earns it. I'm fairly certain that unless I have an exceptionally stellar rest of the year, this book will be making it into my top ten books of the year, maybe even my top five. I have made nearly all of my IRL friends read it, so now I want everyone who I have only met virtually to read it, too. It gave me joy. I do not know how many cis men it will give joy, but I'd like to think they can spot a good thing when they see it. For anyone who isn't a cis man, you especially might like this.It's about a woman, a professor, who kills men who do bad things (especially to women) in order to curb her murderous urges. The book opens with her executing the very well-planned out murder of a frat-boy she'd previously had in one of her classes, and who was getting away with being a serial rapist. It just gets more wild and satisfying from there.The other main character is an undergrad at the same university who finds herself away from her emotionally neglectful home for the first time, living with a roommate that she may have a crush on, and who something terrible happens to.How the storylines of the two characters came together really surprised me, which is hard to do! But it helps that this isn't a thriller that was written just to shock or titillate. It's got bones to it, and while the twists and turns are extremely fun and surprising, what sticks with you is the simplicity of the premise and the arc of the main characters.For all of you bi- and pansexuals out there, you will like this one as well.All in all, one of my favorite books of the year. I finished my library copy and immediately purchased a brand new hardcover of my own to keep forever and ever.
3297697679	If you like crazy, dark and twisted, then this is the book for you. Usually I am not one of those fans. UNTIL NOW! What a book!Scarlett is a professor at Gorman College, but also has a unique side job. She is a serial killer with the sole purpose to rid the world of awful men. Let's just say she has definitely honed her craft. Carly is an incoming freshman, an extremely bright girl who has lived a sheltered life. Until she meets her beautiful confident roommate Allison. With Allison by her side, her world expands more than she could have ever imagined. This book flies, with short chapters alternating between Scarlett and CarlyThe two separate storylines leaves the reader wondering how they will interact. There are moments in this book that left we dumbstruck, mouth agape and in awe of the expert execution. This is one wild ride. The writing is excellent.

4219772680	chappell roan please i'll give you two bucks and a grilled cheese to turn this into a music video “who’s smiling now, motherfucker?” scarlett is an exceptional english professor. she's even better at getting away with murder, though. her hit list? only the slimiest men at gormon university. but when she loses control with her latest victim, it threatens to drag up everything—and everyone—she’s worked her whole life to bury.meanwhile, carly's just trying to blend in. finally free of her emotionally abusive father, she finds herself sucked into her roommate allison's orbit, the two quickly forming an intense friendship. so when allison gets sexually assaulted at a party, carly gets a little obsessed with revenge. they say looks can kill and she might try.[you did some bad things, but i’m the worst of them.]this one goes out to all my bitches who visibly had a big gay crisis watching taylor swift perform vigilante shit at the eras tour.let’s get this out of the way first. yeah, whatever, murder is bad and living a life in pursuit of revenge is unhealthy but consider this: hot murderous bisexuals 🫶they never learn was such a thrill. easily the most gratifying book i’ve read all year. i’d hit play on my audiobook, then suddenly five hours would have passed and i'd accomplished zero work? (if you’re my boss, you do not see this.) the plot was so compelling it was actually becoming inconvenient with real life.it’s full of vindictive women being unleashed, calloused and cruel and fucking starving and goddamn did i want them to get everything their bloodthirsty hearts desired.you look down at all carefully woven systems of abuse, inherently uneven power dynamics, rape culture, and male entitlement, then watch these women get angry and take back control, unspooling these threads of rage with sharpened teeth and claws. as someone who stood beneath a hot shower and scrubbed their skin raw after a day of grad school far too many times, it was catharsis like no other. “all the cutest girls are bi, didn’t you get the memo?”
4270005331	3.5 starsThe hype for this book is real and...the hype got to me. This one really isn't that thrillery to me and the twists were pretty obvious from the start. I enjoyed following Scarlett and seeing her kill men she feels deserves to die. Watching her slowly lose control was so interesting and I was hooked so that I could see if everything was going to catch up to her or not. I love books about serial killer and found her character so interesting. As a thriller, though, nothing was shocking or scary at all. To me, this actually wasn't that much different from reading a romance novel about a serial killer. There was some suspense and I really loved what this novel was trying to do, and I loved the short chapters that made the book go by even faster, but I was underwhelmed with the "twists" throughout.
3335996103	If Dexter was a woman it would definitely be Professor Scarlett Clark. She has a way of giving men what they deserve after they have slipped through the cracks and escaped justice. Carly is a student with her own demons. The way their stories collide is completely unexpected and was just one of the many shocking elements that combined to create a memorable and original thriller that had me cheering the morally challenged protagonists. The last line uttered by Carly also had me maniacally cheering. Gripping, enthralling and totally entertaining!
3528946209	Well… at least this is a fast read.341 pages75 chapters92k wordsUnfortunately I did not like the storyline.A story of a female vigilante, who is really a serial killer, did not work for me.The writing is not bad, but I wasn’t really impressed or engaged or thrilled.I found this book too hollow.PS edited from my original post. I had to correct “75 pages” to “75 chapters”. That’s right, 75 chapters!
3422209536	Who doesn’t love a sweet little revenge/vigilante thriller? This was so deliciously enjoyable it ought to come with a warning! We follow the story of 30 something Dr. Scarlett Clark, a professor of English literature at Gorman University. While she enjoys her teaching work, she also indulges in a spot of murder. But she only kills nasty men who abuse or mistreat women.We also follow Carly Schiller, an 18 year old student at Gorman. She is modest, shy, socially awkward and struggles to fit into the somewhat free wheeling university life. Poor Carly, she can hardly say “boo” to anyone but when her roommate and friend is treated badly, drugged and abused by an entitled jock she finds her voice, and her strength.I loved both characters and the large supporting cast but Scarlett was the star. She was so smart, sassy, confident and snarky - she was a joy to imagine. But in the way of these stories Scarlett’s ahem, extracurricular activities are at risk of coming to and abrupt halt as things go sideways in her latest venture. I don’t want to say more and spoil it for anyone, but I I do highly recommend this captivating story - 4.5 stars. Many thanks to Edelweiss, the publisher and Layne Fargo for providing me with a copy for review.
6181678958	OH. MY. GAH. This is one of the best thrillers I've read in a long time!! It's a super satisfying ending and just overall a page-turner. Not at all what I expected in the best way. It's quickly going down as one of my favorites!!I don't want to give anything away, so I'm just going to say nothing - but if you loved the spin of The Silent Patient - you'll love this one!! Reading this thriller entirely for me. Because the premise looks deliciously good. I love any time feminine rage bursts out of a woman who's just had *enough*.

5714402604	This book follows two storylines - Scarlet and Carly. And while Scarlet's was interesting, deadly, and fun, Carly's was predictable and cliché. I kept wishing for Carly's POV to hurry up and be done so I could get back to Scarlet. 5 stars for Scarlet. 2 stars for Carly. I guess we'll meet in the middle with a 3.5 :)
4430700673	this is what pretty little liars should have been like, but alas. i would have given this five stars had i not guessed the ~twist~ literally before the halfway mark, which is unfortunate, but it's still a really solid read. layne fargo and i are besties
3603703670	5 STARS.⁣Thank you so much to Scout Press for the gifted copy! Hello thriller perfection! I loved this book SO much + it’s an absolute must read for fall 🙌🏼⁣⁣This book had the best first chapter I think I have ever read in my life. It was so dark, fun, + hooked me from the very first sentence. I absolutely loved the premise of a female protagonist that hunts + kills abusive men. I have never read a book like this before, but this feminist queer thriller was everything that I needed in my life. I also really loved how this book does a fantastic job at keeping you entertained the entire time. Not only was it so much fun going back + forth between two POVs, but there was ALWAYS something happening in the story. I always love when there is never a dull moment in a thriller + that’s exactly how this book was.⁣⁣One of my favorite things about this book was how the story was set up. I love that it’s not your typical thriller in the sense that in most cases you don’t know who the killer is until the very ending. I thoroughly enjoyed how in this book we know the killer right from the beginning + it was so much fun trying to figure out the ‘why’. Although this does take out the extreme shock-factor, I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. I will say that I saw the main plot twist coming from a mile away, but it happened so early on that it didn’t really bother me. This book was truly everything that I was hoping for in the end + it was just overall incredible. If you’re a thriller lover or a fan of the show Dexter, I urge you to pick this one up ASAP 🔪⁣⁣CW: rape, sexual assault, victim blaming, domestic abuse, mentions of suicide, ⁣
6777461710	Wow. Never thought I’d enjoy this as much as I did.Truly, some men are gross, perverted, and utterly clueless—preying on the innocence of young women, feeding on their weakness and vulnerability. Scarlet is a very interesting character. She has a lot of layers—she’s not just a vigilante seeking justice, stalking and killing her targets; she’s probably also a sociopath. Haha. Well, I liked her. She’s smart, deadly, and someone I’d want as a friend.And the twist? Wow! That caught me off guard. I was not expecting that. And after it was revealed, everything made sense.This is a dark, twisted, and edgy read. Brilliant.
5910524096	I love supporting women’s wrongs 💕 CW: murder, violence, blood, sexual assault + rape, victim blaming, recurring references to sexual abuse, drugging, stalking, sexually predatory authority figures, brief references to domestic violence/abuse, infidelity, brief sexual content
4005756978	"He wasn't afraid of me, I write. That was his first mistake."They Never Learnby Layne FargoI just.....I loved it.As you can see from the reviews and ratings on here, this is very highly rated. I can see why. I really liked it. I cannot even put into words how impressed with the writing I was. In a world where thrillers no longer surprise-this one surprised.However, to properly review this book, I need to first admit I can understand the feelings of the people who did NOT like it.And also I feel a bit of a hypocrite for liking it. Will explain a bit later.But first-there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to do this AT ALL without spoilers. No way. So if you want to read this book-and I hope you do-please skip my review. Because I am going to be using spoilers all over the place.SPOILERS:Now. I said I understand the negative feedback. I do. Because, in many other books, I have written the same.I cannot even count how many books I have rated on the low side, because the sociopath never gets what's coming to them. I mean-I do that all the time. It is a pet peeve of mine.So for the people complaining that this book glorifies a serial killer-I hear you. This is why it does not get a five from me. I was disturbed. But for the first time I had to give it a high rating anyway.The writer made me care. She made me sympathize with this woman. Now admittedly it was Carly I was sympathizing through much of the book and this is before the big reveal. But it was painful. That girl was so unloved and thrown away. The rage building within her was heartbreaking to watch. I wanted to reach into the book and scream "someone do something! Someone save this girl!"Nobody did obviously.Then when the big reveal hits about halfway in, I gasped out loud.I have not done that in years. It's been years since I FELT the twist. I have become numb to twists because almost all mysteries have them so I just do not feel much when they occur.I FELT this. Was NOT expecting it and I screamed: OMG-They are the same fucking person!!"This book deserves a high rating just for that.The murders? Here is how I see it. Although I loved the book, I could not take Scarlet's half as seriously, mainly because of the end. It did get a bit crazy and I started having to suspend disbelief. Also in real life, this could never happen because Scarlett is-or in real life would be- a sociopath and they cannot fall in love or even sympathize with others. So, what I am trying to say is yes, I kind of felt contradictory toward Scarlett but I also knew I was reading a book-LOL. So, I was able to distinguish between the fact that no way would I feel anything for her in reality but this was indeed a book where sociopaths can fall in love and make new and exciting lives for themselves. Anything's possible in fiction! One of my all time favorite books is Daughters of Eve which is so different then this but also shows how quickly wanting justice can go to wanting vengeance. I recommend that book as well.As for "They never learn" I really wish the author had at least made Scarlettt stop killing at the end. It would have been nice to think her soul had been healed, she'd found love and she did not need to do this anymore.I remain utterly wowed by the strength of the twist.Carly's story obviously deeply affected me. I almost wish the whole story had been hers alone but also wish she had not become who she eventually did. This brings up the whole "nature versus nurture" theory. Would Carly have beena different person if someone had helped her? What would have happened if Allison had never been assaulted? Or if her assault had been taken seriously by University? Or if her mother had damn well LOVED her?Would she still have wound up evil?I guess we will never know. But this book will stay with me for quite awhile. It wasn't perfect but it was both poignant and fun. It was touching yet wacky. It was deeply thought provoking and surprising. A strong four stars from me for a very unique book.
3591307000	It didn't start out strong. The action was there from the jump, but the characters irritated me. One was too weak, the other too aggressive. I almost gave up on it, but ultimately stuck it through. The second half was far better. The two characters grew in a way that they complimented one another enough to make them both likeable in their own way. I marked it as 4 star, but I'm really leaning more towards a 3.5. It isn't one that I'm going to recommend to my friends as must read, but I wouldn't try to actively try to steer anyone away from this book.
5405482410	damn that was fucking nuts. I loved it.
4742798332	A heartwarming, feel-good read told from two female characters' points of view about women supporting women through life's trials. Ok, are the cis-het men gone?Good. I thought I'd do something fun and a little different with this review because I am SO. ENRAGED. about the loss of civil rights I recently experienced. And since I'm not nearly as clever as Scarlett or Mina, I'm gonna have to go with destroying some man's book review instead of actually murdering someone. When I went to download this book from Audible, I happened to look at the first review posted. It was written by some idiot who can't see the forest for the trees. Let's call him "Don." I'm going to take his fairly negative review apart point by point, because I crave violence but can't have it. So. Don began his review by stating he had been "looking forward to this one for awhile." One would think, Don, that if you were looking forward to a book, you would perhaps know what it was about? At least in general terms? Because the rest of your review seems to indicate that you weren't expecting things like murder, especially not female-on-male murder, which leads me to believe that you have selective reading ability. Every synopsis of this book that I can find when I google the title mentions that the book is about a woman who selectively kills men. Don goes on to say, "I would have appreciated a little advanced warning" (IT'S CALLED GOOGLE, DON), and "you'll like this if the following are your cup of tea." Let's move on to the components Don took issue with. "All men are awful, apparently, and will assault you. Even the nice ones," was Don's first point. Don, you sweet summer child, which of the men who died in this novel did you think was "nice"? Was it the predatory professor who attempted not only to seduce students but also to steal the intellectual property and hard work of his female colleagues and pass it off as his own? Was it the graduate student who threatened violence and coerced and manipulated women to get his way? Was it the undergrad who was the walking epitome of the "nice guy" trope? Don, I urge you, google some of the shit "nice guys" have said and done when they realized their "niceness" didn't automatically qualify them for sexual favors from their female "friends." And yeah, Don, the reality for most women is that we can't be sure which of the men we encounter will attempt to assault or harm us. Check out the news every once in awhile. Even just the crime section. "A surprising number of people are cool with someone killing people and want to do it themselves." Without giving away spoilers, the number of killers in this book is QUITE low. And if you had ever been assaulted, you'd probably want revenge too. Don's next point is my favorite: "Women seem to all be lesbians." Dude. This is bi- and pan-erasure! And the female characters IN QUESTION (not even all of them) in this book explicitly state that they are bisexual. Is three bisexual characters really that surprising to you? I assure you, we're around. Everywhere. You probably know some of us (but I'm not surprised that no one you know would feel comfortable disclosing their identity to you). Next sentence, Don claims, "Not an issue, just wasn't expecting it or that it happen [sic] that many times." Wow Don, you are SO COOL for "not having an issue" with the false assertion in your previous sentence that this book makes it appear that all women are lesbians. SO. COOL. (Wait, didn't you say earlier that you needed "advanced warning" for the items on your list in this review? You needed advanced warning for lesbian relationships? I thought you "didn't have an issue" with it? Further, I would like to add, what decade is this??)Lastly, Don states, "There are absolutely no likeable [sic] characters except for Drew and his partner. Definitely not a light read or a heartwarming, uplifting tale." Well, Don, I do have to agree that Drew and RAFAEL (he has a name, Don. Let's move away from defining people based on their relationships to others) are lovely. But I found Scarlett to be QUITE likable. She's very intelligent, and she's strong as hell, and she's built herself up from the ground to be the hero she needed when she was younger. What's not to love about a character like that? I guess I could see how that would intimidate you, actually. Go back to reading Jack Reacher, it might be tame enough for you.While my tagline at the top was meant to be a little tongue-in-cheek, I stand by it. This book DID warm my heart and it IS about women supporting women. In short, this book rocks, and you'll love it too if you're at all interested in a highly intelligent female serial killer who only targets horrible men.
4138706585	4.5 out of 5 stars.I LOVED THIS.
3663783782	scarlett: i respect men's rights......men's rights of dying!!also ps.: scarlett doesn't go searching for the worst man, they are all over universities' campuses so...her serial killer isn't difficult.but that was an amazing book and scarlett is an amazing character, i also loved how the points of views worked and the end was definitely what we -readers- needed.
3254416894	4.5 Stars — THEY NEVER LEARN is a twisted and engrossing tale of vigilante justice, a female serial killer targeting toxic predatory men. All those "your body, my choice" bros out there made it easy to root for the psychopath. (Or sociopath? I can't tell.) The writing was smart and addictive, and I liked the dark humor that was woven into this unsetting story. Enjoyed! Recommended to fans of fast-paced, edgy revenge thrillers. Many thanks to the publisher and Edelweiss for providing a digital copy of this book. Opinions are my own.
3254438002	They Never Learn was the most fun I've had with a book in ages. It's far from perfect (it notably leans into an obsession with the glam femme fatale in a way that wouldn't have been out of place with mid-2000s feminist media), but I'm just going to leave that criticism at the door because I had such a damn good time reading this.It follows Scarlett, a professor-turned-vigilante serial killer who spends her evenings tracking down and murdering men who have abused women. We also follow a student at her university, Carly, a shy 18-year-old who becomes infatuated with her roommate. Their chapters alternate, each a short, 3-5 page segment that confidently leaps from one perspective to the next, daring the reader to keep up. This book is a page-turner, first and foremost, and it does a spectacular job at cohering into something that you can devour in a single sitting if you're so inclined. This book is so clever, so unexpected, so deliciously indulgent. Scarlett is a brilliant creation, and Carly's chapters work to ground the novel and develop a character whose quotidian anxieties you can sympathize with, while Scarlett's chapters amp up the stakes. Highly recommended to all thriller fans, with the caveat of there being a significant trigger warning for sexual assault.I won an advanced copy of this book in a Goodreads giveaway; thanks Gallery Scout Press. All thoughts are my own.
3419411765	A serial killer is on the loose at Gorman University. No one would suspect that professor Scarlett Clark is behind all of the murders, until the last kill goes awry. Will her secret finally be exposed?Carly is a Freshman at Gorman University, where she is an English major. When she meets her roommate, Allison, she is enamored by her. Allison is sexually assaulted at a Halloween party and Carly vows to do everything she can to protect her new friend. I decided to read this book because of all of the rave reviews. That being said, I find myself in the minority, as I had a really difficult time getting through it. The thing that bothered me the most is the misandry. All men are not evil rapists, abusers, pedophiles etc. as they are portrayed in this book. I mean every male character is AWFUL. Also, I find it very difficult to believe that the police would not suspect Scarlett when half of Gorman’s male population is turning up DEAD. I enjoyed the short chapters, but this was more of a slow burn thriller with very few thrills. There was one twist that took way too long to be revealed and by that time, it didn’t really intrigue me into wanting to find out how it ended. It also felt like the author was trying to promote feminism and female collaboration in a very strange and dangerous way. Unfortunately, this book was just not for me.2.5/5 stars
5728310455	4,5 ✨✨✨(Audiobook)Scarlett is like a baby Lana Myers, from The Mindf*ck series. 🔥💀💜Slay, girlfriend!💪🏻🗡️🎯😎
4216295781	Me at the beginning: *begging for a double sapphic story* The book halfway through: I liked the story overall, but it is more plot than character focused, and as a character driven reader, it was not enough for me to give it 4 stars.
