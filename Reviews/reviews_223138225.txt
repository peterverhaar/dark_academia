7649200671	King delivers once again! I just love academic settings and vibes, and this definitely has them. The book picked up right where the first left off and we were able to learn more about the characters to build on their development. I absolutely love the mystery puzzle nature of the way it is written. It kept me interested the entire time. I was never bored. So well done!
8013291703	I'm a little late with this one (life). I had to reread bits and pieces of the first one to get on track with this one.It was worth it! This book covered a lot of the questions I had in the first one. Our main female character came into magic without realizing she had any magic abilities at all. Book two helped build on this with (SURPRISE) more plot twist. It was engaging and kept me interested. I appreciate Ever King for letting me ARC both the first in the series and this book. I'm really glad I signed on for this series.

7517537804	my rating: ★★★★.5aesthetic: 🦋🌸🗝️🍃💀🥀💫📓🏛️🎀Lessons in Loyalty is a powerful, immersive sequel that not only builds on the magical chaos of book one, but deepens it with emotional intensity, layered storytelling, and standout mythological integration.What truly sets this installment apart is the intricate weaving of Greek mythology retellings. The lore is handled with both reverence and creative freedom, reimagining familiar gods, legends, and curses in ways that feel fresh and unpredictable. Every myth felt intentional, thematically relevant, and rich with symbolism—especially as it parallels the characters’ internal struggles and choices.The characters from the first book return with even more weight and complexity. It was incredible to see how their past decisions ripple through this story, particularly as alliances are tested and loyalties questioned. Their growth is tangible—you feel the ache of their mistakes and the strength of their evolution. The emotional impact of their arcs in this book hits deeper than expected, leaving lasting impressions long after the final chapter.Romance, betrayal, power struggles, and a healthy dose of magical academia—all of it blends perfectly in a world that feels darkly enchanting and morally grey. This sequel strikes a strong balance between high-stakes action and emotional vulnerability, keeping readers hooked from beginning to end.If book one cracked open the door to this world, Lessons in Loyalty flings it wide open and dares you to walk through. Ever King continues to prove that this isn’t just a dark academia fantasy—it’s a myth-soaked journey of identity, redemption, and what it truly means to be loyalThank you so much to Ever King for the opportunity to read an advanced reader copy of this book
7763945310	I thought I loved book one? Book two is EVEN BETTER. This was another great read and I absolutely love the way that myth and lore are weaved into these books. Bastian is the embodiment is embodiment of an arrogant, broody morally dark man and I am HERE FOR IT. Lyla proves that strength can still be found in soft femininity, and that can you can still be fierce and change lives. I am obsessed with this series, the magic system, and the way the lore is all rolled together into a fun and captivating read. You don’t want to miss out on this unique (and spicy 👀) retelling of Adonis and Aphrodite!
7605711147	ARC Review 5⭐️ Read I’m obsessed with this world! Lessons in Royalty made this series even better!! I didn’t think that was impossible after the first book Academy of Villains but Miss Ever King did that! The author has a way of making everything connected whether it’s with big or small details from the story and characters, she does it in a way that’s very entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lyla Stark is someone you’ll quickly love she’s a fun character with strong independent vibes. Whether it’s her attitude or smart remarks, she’s going to find a place in your heart very quickly.Bastian Lightcroft what’s not to love about him He has mysterious dark vibes and secretive which a lot of us love in our book's characters. It’s the 2nd book in the series but you still get to see familiar faces in this one. Lessons in Royalty is its own story with two different characters. That will find its way into your hearts but once you hear the names of the other characters again you’ll feel like you’re getting to see old friends again. The world-building is easy to follow. The magic system is unique and fun with a twist. I absolutely love the world-building and the magic system. What I enjoyed the most about this is the fact that you get a different point of view from this world with different characters and you get to experience a different mystery, a different darkness, a different love story And most of all character development and growth. The found family in this continues to grow and turn into something that you can’t get enough of. It’s like once this book ends and you turn the last page you say to yourself I wanna read that again to go back to experience it all over again. What to expect with this book. 💛secrets 💛mystery 💛Found family 💛Romance 💛Light spice 💛Protective love interest 💛Magic and spells And so much more. This is one series I think all fantasy readers should give a try. Whether you’re into Greek mythology retelling or not and just love fantasy give this series a try it’s easy to follow and the characters are amazing. The author Ever King does a fantastic job of tying up her stories in a way where it makes you excited for one book to end and another book to start if that makes sense.
7387029454	I have not been able to stop thinking about this book since I finished it last night! Ever King is a master of world building and lore, and we got so much more of both in Book 2 of the Academy of Villains series. I ate up every second of this book!The relationships in Lessons in Loyalty were probably my favorite, and not just the romantic ones! I love a strong girl gang, and Lyla definitely found hers in this book. Watching Lyla’s relationship with both Kiara and Octavia strengthen throughout the book was inspiring, and I can’t wait to see where they all go from here! The Heartstrings struck again, and this time we got to watch Lyla and Bastian’s relationship bloom! The banter between these 2 was delightful, and I could not get enough of their snarky back and forth. Bastian was such a softie only where Lyla was concerned, and those are always my favorite MMCs. I loved how much he wanted to protect her, but more importantly I loved that he wanted to ensure she was capable of protecting herself. Lyla may have been slightly unsure of her ability to do just that at the start of the book, but she was the main badass of this book by the end of it! We got to learn so much more about the troubles the Kingdom of Ithaka has been facing, and Bastian’s unwilling part he had to play in all of that was absolutely heartbreaking. I’m so glad he has Lyla to help him move forward from here! I am dying for Book 3, and I cannot wait to see who our next couple will be! I definitely have a few ideas. 😏 thank you so much to Ever King for the opportunity to read this as an ARC! 💛🏛️✨
7152011294	4,5✨Lessons in Loyalty brought what the first part of the series did - it was exciting, romantic, dark, yet hopeful. It had everything you need for a good fantasy story. I found this book a bit clichéd (much like the first book) in one or two places, but in the best possible way, so it didn't take away from the reading experience at all.With each new book, I become more invested in this series. I liked that this book was written from different POVs than Academy of Villains, so I was able to learn new things about the world of the series from the perspective of new characters. This book had a very complex world-building, which I love so much! I learned more about the historical background and how the magic system works, and that was exciting for me.Bastian and Lyla were much more exciting to me than Kiara and Lucian in the first book, and I especially enjoyed reading about them. Bastian grew on me in Academy of Villains, and I liked him even more in this book, and I hope he will play an important role in the rest of the series. Lyla was also likable, and I found her character very interesting. And their love story was incredible. I loved every moment of it; they were so compatible, it was a joy to read about them! Thank you so much for the opportunity to read this book. I am looking forward to the next in the series (I beg Tobias to be the next main character, I love that man).
7698398417	I can’t decide whose story I loved more.. Lucian and Kiara or Lyla and Bastian!? 🫣🥺 I vibes so much with Lyla! I loved her perseverance and willingness to explore what she was first uncomfortable with. She turned into such a badass with Kiara, Octavia and Lyla being a team!🎀💪🏼Ever King does their stories well! Both books started with a bang and you immediately get to dive into the characters. There’s no dilly dallying and Ever keeps the reader intrigued and thinking!Do I need book 3 right now!? Absolutely! Will I be in a hangover until then? More than likely!
7816383543	I am absolutely here for Academy of Villains: Lessons in Loyalty, because wow! This book brings the drama, the excitement, and all the right vibes! Here's what you can expect:Villain gets the girlGrumpy x SunshineRivals to LoversFound FamilySecret SocietiesDark AcademiaGreek Mythology RetellingI wasn't all that sold on Bastian in book one (sorry, not sorry), so when I found out he was the MMC in book two, I was honestly skeptical. I even told the author I looked forward to her trying to change my mind about him.I love a good redemption arc, and Bastian’s story totally delivered. He’s haunted by his past and keeps everyone at arm’s length, terrified the truth about what he’s done will come out. So of course, he pushes Lyla away, even as their chemistry sizzles.And Lyla is a fantastic FMC. After being tormented at the academy, she’s done playing the victim. She steps up, takes charge, and shows off her kind, clever, and quietly fierce spirit. If anyone could crack Bastian’s icy exterior, it’s definitely her.Their relationship is the definition of slow burn; every stolen glance and heated argument had me grinning and rooting for them. Add in their training sessions and the looming threat of the king (still possessed by Moros), and you’ve got a plot that keeps you hooked.I love that Kiara and Lucian are still a part of the action, and we get way more time with the Ravens. Learning about the guys, especially Tobias, who remains a top-tier favourite, was such a treat. I can’t wait to see what’s next for him and Octavia!All the best parts of Dark Academia are still here: the aesthetics, the fun, the intrigue. And Ever isn’t afraid to go a little darker and deeper, which just makes the story even richer. Seriously, if you want a series that’s equally electric and mysterious, Academy of Villains is where it’s at. I highly recommend!
7200574967	Lessons in Loyalty is book two of Ever King's Academy of Villains series. Each book in the series will feature a couple inspired by Greek Mythology with this book focusing on Adonis and Aphrodite.If you haven't read Academy of Villains, what are you doing!? Go add it to your TBR now and come back after to read this review. ♡This story focuses on Lyla and Bastian with the occasional POV from Kiara and Lucian. Lyla is a forestmage attending the Academy of Magic. She lives in the greenhouse tending to the plants. Bastian is a member of the raven society, an alchemist, and a weapon of the corrupt king. He is given a task by the Beast of Thorns to steal a golden apple for the king. Along with the secrets Bastian holds close, Lyla uncovers truths that were meant to stay hidden that will reshape everything she has believed in. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.I loved this book so much. The world-building is perfection. We get just enough detail about the world of Ithaka without any confusion about the places or creatures. The academy is the main setting, however, we begin discovering just enough of Ithaka to get fully immersed: the village of Sablewick, Pandora, Fatewood Forest, and the River Lethe. I can see these places and the scenes clearly in my mind when I think back to them. We were introduced to new creatures. My favorite was the barkling which was a tiny wooden creature that lived in the greenhouse and was protective of Lyla. The magic system is expanding. Not only do we see the use of the mage's grimoires, but also charm cards, runes, and ancient uncontrollable magic. We are also discovering other magical beings, witches and nymphs.I loved Lyla and Bastian's characters. Their first main encounter in Lyla's bedroom has me smiling like a fool the entire scene. Bastian spends a lot of time trying to protect Lyla from himself and the things that scare him. Lyla's entire vibe feels innocent which I think is a huge advantage. She is strong, ambitious, and destined for power.Here are three Bastian quotes with no context that had me falling in love with this man:“I’m proud of you,”"One more ghost for my grimoire."“Bastian groans, dragging me closer, like he can’t get enough."I knew from the moment I finished Academy of Villains that this was going to be one that would live in my head rent-free. Lessons in Loyalty has exceeded my expectations which I didn't even think was possible. I can't wait to read what comes next!dark academia • dark fantasy • dark romance • fated love • found family • greek mythology • grumpy x sunshine • magic • mythology • retelling • rivals to lovers • romantasy • secret society
7552150970	⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5🌶️Speechless. Shooketh. Listen, the first book had me by the throat. The story was so fucking good, the characters *chef’s kiss* , but this one? THIS BOOK???????? Holy fuck. I’ve always been a fan of Greek mythology and that’s what drew me to this series in the first place. The way Ever mixes in little, lesser known tidbits of myth into the stories, Jesus. Seeing the overall plot continue and grow from book one only solidified my love for this series even more. I love everything about the magic system, the politics, the characters, the little clues and peeks at things that have you questioning what’s going to happen next. Lyla was definitely the underdog. To go from a pretty, demure, sweet woman to a fierce warrior who fights for the truth was so incredible to see. Her romance with Bastian, grappling with the truth of her own existence, and trying to stop the King and amorous from destroying the world? She’s more than just a flower girl. She’s a badass. Sweet baby Bastian. I don’t care what anyone says, he was a victim, too. To lose his brother for defying the king and then living with that terror for himself and his family? It’s no wonder he did what he needed to survive. While I didn’t support everything he did, I understand why he did it and I still feel for him. He deserves all the love in the world. I cannot WAIT to see where this series goes, who book 3 is about, and what’s going to happen with the entire world. Thank you so much to Ever for the ARC of this book! 🫶🏻
7293384465	I devoured Academy of Villains last year, because of how well King builds not just her worlds - full of wonder and mythology - but also her relationships and her characters. With Lessons in Loyalty we pivot away from Kiara and Lucian and look to Lyla, our resident green thumb, and Bastain, our resident mysterious pretty boy, but we maintain with this new relationship King’s perfect grasp of relationships, banter and unlikely connections. From the first few chapters I was HOOKED into their dynamic, which has all the tension, longing and yearning you could desire and HEAPS of angst as Bastian struggles with his loyalties and his feelings for Lyla, who is everything he is not - his perfect opposite. The stakes are high, the tension is on fire, and the swoonworthy, gallant romance is delectable. A TREAT for my soul, and an incredible continuation of such a unique series which I cannot get enough of. Thank you Ever King for the ARC (and for adding seven book boyfriends to my roster).
7589592070	Dark academia romantasy book 2Lessons in Loyalty by Ever King Academy of Villains book 2Thank you to Ever for entrusting me with a gifted copy! Dark academia romantasy - each book is a different couple as the main focus, but for the story need to read in orderDual POV, hate to love, found family, amazing female trio, forest mage FMC, morally grey MMC who excels in potions, magical bonds, inspired by Greek mythology (Adonis and Aphrodite), touch her and find out, so many secrets, they save each other, visions, betrayal, evil king, mages and witches, cursed kingdom, secret society, political intrigue, training - both physical and magicOur adventure continues with Lyla and Bastian being the main characters in this book! We still get a lot of Kiara and Lucian, which I love! And I felt like we got to know the rest of the gang better this book too! We get a bit more away from the academia in this one, but we still get the setting of them all being on the academy grounds most of the time. The Raven Society is working hard to try to protect the kingdom, and the women are hatching plans of their own! I felt so bad for Bastian with everything he was going through and enjoyed rooting for him and Lyla. I know who the next couple is and I'm so excited to read the next book!!
7818988622	If I thought book 1 was good, oh this was A-MAZING!As I said on the first book, I love the world building (the academy reminds me a lot of Hogwarts and Harry Potter was what made me fall in love for books as a child), I love the magic system and the cast of characters is vast and diverse but so good.The ones we know better so far, I live for them. They are good individually (of course they have their flaws like everyone else) but even better with each other and the Heartstring bond in something so beautiful. I love how beautifully it is described. As for the others (now secondary characters but we'll know better): some I actually like because we could see a bit of them already, others are more reserved like Kaspian and I don't have much of an opinion yet but he intrigues me a lot.Also there's something I REALLY loved on this book that I didn't see much of the reference on the first one. On the synopsis it says "if you love Sailor Moon, welcome to Academy of Villains" and, as I said, on the first book I didn't see it there but in this one, oh I saw the references!#SPOILER AHEAD#The 3 main girls and their equal necklaces that makes them The Starmarked who were warriors and then on the past they were seven, so now they need to find the others. Oh that's SO Sailor Moon and I LOVED IT. I'm SO HERE FOR IT! Sailor Moon was my favorite when I was a child so this is just getting better and better for me.So excited for the 3rd book.
7694548676	Enemies to lovers fans—you’re about to eat well.This time, the spotlight is on Lyla & Bastian (Adonis & Aphrodite reimagined), and I knew from book one that their chemistry was going to explode. The tension? Unmatched. The banter? Sharper than a blade. And Bastian? He’s giving “touch her and you die” energy with just enough softness to make you melt. & I’m here for it!! 😊What I love about this series is how the female characters are always unapologetic badasses❤️‍🔥. Lyla holds her own, and watching her dynamics with Bastian shift from enemies to reluctant allies to something much more was addicting.The title Lessons in Loyalty couldn’t be more perfect. Loyalties are tested. Lies unravel. Truths surface. And in the chaos, you finally see who the true king really is. And now we also have more clues on how to break his curse over the kingdom. By the end, I was on the edge of my seat—Ever King doesn’t let up. The character growth between Lyla & Bastian feels like it’s setting the stage for something even bigger, and I’m desperate to see how it all ties into the next installment: Lessons in Trickery. Which comes out this fall! 💜If you’re craving dark academia, Greek myth retellings, enemies-to-lovers tension, and characters who fight as hard as they fall in love, this series deserves your attention.Thank you @authoreverking for the ARC! I’m officially hooked for the long haul! 💛
7835329287	This is a really good follow up to book one and picks up right where we left off in book one. I loved being able to dive back into this world from different characters point of view! But also those little Kiara and Lucien chapters were divine.This world gives me so many Harry Potter vibes and I love it! Seeing them actually grow into their magic and even into their own person is amazing. I wasn’t sure how I would feel about Bastian as he was a mysterious character in the first book and like he was hiding something important but reading his book made my heart hurt for him as he has had to make so many hard choices in his short life sweet.Lyla comes across as such a sweet, soft girl that is unsure of herself in the beginning and it was so amazing to see her grow to be more confident and sure of herself as a person but also as a mage. They are perfect together!I can’t wait to be able to read the next book in this series and see how the characters grow, who they find themselves with romantically and also how they manage to save Ithaka
7842826986	Now I loved book 1 and I thought Lucian and Kiara were my favorite couple but omgggg Bastian and Lyla are making it HARD! Am I changing my mind? Idk yet 🤷🏻‍♀️ The dual POV in the story telling, romance, and the unique world building is top tier. If you love found family, dark academia, Greek mythology retellings, secrets societies, and when the villain gets the girl? This series is 1000% for you. I’m hooked completely and book 3 couldn’t get her fast enough. Well done I can’t wait to see where you take this series. I’m completely obsessed 🤩 I rate this book a 4.5
7152147712	I remember requesting the first book in this series through Netgalley. I was positively surprised AND really curious about the other books in the series. I was therefore very glad to become part of the Everkingdom so I could read this arc!About halfway I discovered that I wasn't really enjoying the book because I was reading it with the wrong mindset. I started this book expecting a romantasy, but it's quite clear that this series no longer fits into that category. This is an epic fantasy with a strong romance plot. The politics is complicated, the pace is relatively slow, a lot is happening around the characters we focus on and it's clear we will only get all pieces of the puzzle when we read all the books in the series.The world building of this series is phenomenal. Everything is thought out so incredibly well and this book really shows that. We get to explore the kingdom outside the academy a little, we learn more about the history of the kingdom, we learn more about the different types of magic and of course we also learn more about what's actually going on and what fight we're fighting. The moment everyone acknowledges that there are more than 2 sides, is the moment I realised: this is bigger than I thought.The romance is still a big part of the plot, though. What I especially loved in this book is that this book shows that having a special connection is not enough to have a relationship. A relationship takes time. It takes understanding each other, it takes learning to share your burdens and secrets, it means being there when no-one else is. Both characters needed time, and had to put in some work, to get there. But the journey, heartbreak and pain was totally worth it!
7369756644	Firstly thank you Ever King for letting me be an ARC reader for this book!!Wow what a ride! I loved the first book and this book was just as good! Seeing more of the story unfold in this installment felt like the characters were playing a game of chess. Right when they thought they had the upper hand the other side would make a move that threw off their strategy. And I can’t wait to see where it goes from here! It’s almost like a puzzle and each book gives you a few pieces but they don’t quite make a picture yet! And this books puzzle pieces are Bastian and Lyla.When we first meet the FMC, Lyla, she spends most of her time in her greenhouse tending her flowers and seems to be a softer character. But the more we learn of her story the more her strength shines through. While others flaunt their power she has a softer quiet power and as the story progresses we see her come more into her power and see what she is truly capable of. And seeing her find herself after seeing her feel helpless was very satisfying and made me cheer her on even more. The MMC, Bastian, is the opposite of Lyla. Bastian knows exactly what he is capable of and he challenges Lyla to realize what she can be capable of if only she’d push herself. He also has a dark side that he keeps hidden and throughout the story Lyla chips away at the walls he has built to see who he truly is. Watching their banter and insults to each other while also having sweet moments was probably my favorite part. Overall another fantastic book! If you are a fan of magical academy’s, Greek mythology, political intrigue, prophecies, soul mates and forbidden love then you won’t want to miss this book! CW: Spice (at least 2 scenes), fantasy violence, slight torture and death
7554410063	"He was the poison in my veins and I savored every drop."This is the second book in the Academy of Villains series. In each book we follow a new couple. This one follows Bastian and Lyla aka "flower girl". I love that each new book in the series will follow a different Raven and their heartstring match! I also love that you see hints in the story at possible future couples. Ever King also throws sprinkles of Greek mythology all througout the stories as well which is fun. I feel like book one was faster paced and more plot driven ( it dropped you right into the action). Book 2 has a slower pace in my opinion and is more character driven even though there is still a lot of plot happening. Another thing I liked was that even though we are following new main characters in this book we still get POV's from Kiara and Lucian occasionally. I think this will likely continue through the rest of the series and I love that we will have a large group of fun and loveable characters.Ever King is really good at showing friendship dynamics throughout these books as well. I love the frienship between the Ravens as well as the friendships that are forming between the girls. I like how they are protective of each other. Lyla and Bastian's relationship is so sweet. It is a little slow going at first but I wouldn't call it a slow burn like book one. I love her butterflies and how they change color with how she is feeling. It is fun to learn about all the different characters magic. There is definitely more spice in this one and it is open door. The story line is engaging and a lot is happening in this one. There are a lot of revelations and new mysteries to solve. I am excited to see where the storyline takes us next and to read about our Ravens and their heartstrings! I can't wait to see whose story is next.You will enjoy this book if you like✨Strong friendships✨Sweet romance ✨Spice ✨Greek mythology sprinkled in✨Dual POV's✨Character driven plots✨Witches✨Hidden portals✨Polictical intrigueThank you so much to EverKing and Netgalley for this arc. All opinions are my own.
7184633214	“Better to die chasing something extraordinary than live ordinary.”The adventure in the Kingdom of Ithaka continues in Academy of Villains: Lessons in Loyalty and I was HERE 👏🏻 FOR 👏🏻 IT 👏🏻In this retelling of the story of Adonis and Aphrodite, we follow Bastian and Lyla - a Spiritmage and a Forestmage, respectively, who have a lot of secrets and of course, the weight of the world on their shoulders.Being the second novel in the series, Lessons in Loyalty deviated ever so slightly from the first novel. In book one, things were fast paced and we were introduced to a cast of characters, as well as this troubled kingdom. In Lessons in Loyalty, the story is medium paced, and the world building is more plentiful than the first novel. However, I think that these elements worked in the story’s favour. Throughout the course of the novel, we are able to gain a better understanding of the plight that the subjects of the Kingdom of Ithaka face, as well as the various character interactions which make me so excited for things to come in subsequent novels!! If it wasn’t already evident, the characters are definitely my favourite part of this series. Bastian is all tough on the outside, soft on the inside, and wants nothing more than to protect Lyla and to worship the ground she walks on. Lyla is literally the sweetest sweetheart that ever there was and her genuine kindness was absolutely infectious - I couldn’t get enough of it!! I also LOVED the little family that Lyla, Octavia, and Kiara have formed together - GIRL POWER 💖I don’t know how else to explain it, but this series reminds me so much of the various fantasy-themed anime I have come to love and enjoy over the years (Lessons in Loyalty specifically gave me Sailor Moon and Solo Leveling vibes ✨). The series as a whole is so imaginative and immersive, and it’s one that I am always excited to dive back into time and again. Kaspian and Tobias are the two characters that I’m the most curious about for future novels - I NEED THEM LIKE I NEED AIR!!!! 💛 Grumpy x Sunshine💛 Rivals to Lovers💛 Found Family💛 Secret Societies💛 Greek Mythological Retelling
7532235215	thank you to the lovely author ever king and netgalley for allowing me an arc for this book for an honest review - especially with how much i loved the first one. i was extremely excited!based on the story of aphrodite and adonis in greek mythology, the second instalment continues from the first book, however follows two new people: lyla and bastian. lyla is a forest mage who takes care of the academy’s greenhouse. she’s sweet, often underestimated but she is shown to be fierce, smart and wanting to know much more of the academy’s secrets and the truth surrounding a mysterious set of necklaces and the true power they hold. while bastian is a spiritmage, much more of a cold exterior and part of the raven society but holds many dark secrets especially when it comes to serving the king. as the book develops, we see his internal struggles with his orders, which would impact lyla, and need to protect his people, baring much more of his soul and intentions to protect the people he loves. lyla and bastian were chefs kiss. their dislike for one another that develops over time is done at a perfect pace and their povs trying to ignore their feelings was well-written. the chemistry, the pining???? excellence. but it’s definitely the tender moments and the ones where they protect one another even in the midst of their “hate” that just scratches the itch. one highlight of this book is the founding family we have between lyla, kiara and octavia. every time they are together i just love their dynamic and love/support for one another. it also contrasts the dark, atmospheric side of this book and the main plots to give it more layers. i truly love this series so far - the mythology, the lore, the politics and magical systems are incredibly researched and written and the romance thrown in? i am obsessed. the world being created is absolutely stunning in my mind and i really cannot wait to see where this story will take us with the twists and turns, revelations and surprises in the next instalment.
7595119933	A spiritmage with too many secrets.A forestmage who swore she’d never fall for a villain.And a thread of fate binding them to a destiny neither can escape.This is their story.WOW this was such a journey. Ever since finishing the first book which I really loved, I couldn't wait to start the second book. And I can only say that I absolutely loved and devoured this book. I really love the relationship between Lyla and Bastian. Their banter, how they were protective of each other, I absolutely ate it up.I love how he calls her flower girl. This is a slow burn with some heat, but the focus is definitely on character and relationship development. I really loved the butterflies that were a reflection of Lyla's emotions, it was so cute. I love the found family in this series, all the characters have different personalities and you love every single one of them. And you can’t wait to read their book. I really love the fight scenes in this book.There are so many things that we find out in this book and there is also so much that we need to find out and learn as the story goes on.There are betrayals and secrets, so much going on that you just want to keep reading the book. And once you finish the book, you can't wait for the next book to come out.Academy of Villains is a dark academia romantasy series inspired by Greek mythology love stories, where morally complex characters navigate a cursed kingdom, secret societies, and heartstring bonds. What can you expect:⚔️ Fated Mates (heartstring)⚔️ Greek Mythology Retelling: Adonis & Aphrodite⚔️ Secret societies⚔️ Slow burn with some heat⚔️ Academic settings ⚔️ Touch her and ☠️Thank you to the author Ever King and publisher for providing me with an e-ARC via NetGalley! I can’t wait to continue the story and to read the 3rd book.
7651812340	Thank you to the publisher, Ever King, and NetGalley for the ARC! I had the privilege of reading the first book in the series, Academy of Villains, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Book two only got better. Bastian and Lyla were two characters that seemed like an unlikely match, but I loved watching Bastian fall in love with Lyla. Lyla is soft and gentle, and Bastian is sarcastic, and hard edged, but watching the way he cared for her and did everything to protect her softened his character. It allowed us as a reader to understand why he was the way he was, and how he was willing to do anything for the people he loves. He had a redemption arc. Ever King has laid the foundation foreshadowing the future of the series. I have a few predictions for the couples that we will see next! I also loved that we got to see more of the magic system as well as revisit characters and their relationships from the previous book. This series really reminds me of Throne of Glass and Harry Potter with a twist. The magic system is complex, but Ever King makes it digestible, and does a good job of hinting back to the previous book. There isn't a ton of info dumping - the magic system doesn't take us out of the world, but serves to enhance.Ever King's writing keeps getting better and better. The setting of Lyla's garden was so beautifully written. Reading about her and her magical butterflies and the creatures she cares for was perhaps my favorite part of the book - aside from the romance, of course. The imagery was absolutely stunning, and I could vividly picture these places in my mind. The writing flows so beautifully and Ever King truly has a way with words.I am excited to continue this series. I love that it pulls on mythology with a brand new twist - it is unlike a lot of other fantasies that I have read. This is my favorite book in the series so far!
7578026089	If you’re here for:✔️ morally grey chaos✔️ enemies who might kiss or kill✔️ plot twists you won’t predict✔️ and a magical school that honestly needs a therapist...Then Lessons in Loyalty will absolutely wreck you. If Academy of Villains broke me open, Lessons in Loyalty buried the remains, danced on them, and whispered, "You still trust people?"This sequel doesn't slow down, it Freakinggggg escalates. The betrayals feel deeper, the stakes sharper, and the characters more unhinged (in the best, most addictive way). Ever King doesn’t believe in sophomore slumps, she believes in sophomore slaughters.What I loved most is how Ever King plays with the concept of loyalty, not just in its obvious sense. But in how it warps love, ambition, and survival. Every character is standing on shaky ground, and you can feel the tension in every conversation, every spell and every sideways glance.There’s more emotion here too, uughhh so raw and messy and real. I found myself wanting to scream at some characters, hug others, and then scream again. The romance burns, yes, but it’s laced with danger and doubt, and that makes it even more irresistible.I can't wait for book threeeee!! I want it now!!
7570631840	Thank you from the bottom of my heart to the author for sharing an ARC of this book with me !!! “Only a God can kill a God”“Flowers don’t bloom for admiration, but they’re worshipped for their beauty. ““He was the poison in my veins and I savoured every drop”Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!! I don’t actually know what kind of drug this author puts into these books but I always find myself wanting more. There is something so enthralling about the way she seamlessly puts together the romance between the characters and the development of a plot that is bigger than them and while it has a kind of beginning and end in every single book, it tells the story of something more that is still to com’è, making the reader obsessed with finding that out!!!Lyla and Bastian story intrigued me in a way I was not expecting. They are the most complicated for of beauty and the beast, grumpy sunshine, good girl bad boy, enemies to lovers, banter and he falls first dynamic I have read about in a while. All wrapped up in Greek mythology retelling fashion and with an academy setting !!! I couldn’t get enough of them. Unfortunately, life got in the way and I couldn’t keep going for other reasons. But when I finally did manage to finish the book … I knew I was a goner for it !!! And when Bastian threw in the magic “good girl” words … it was too late for me to come back !!! I loved this book deeply and I can’t wait for the next one in this crazy Greek inspired amazing series !!! “Why do you call me flower girl?” “Because you bloom … despite all the rot in this world. And that … that makes you rare”“Not every monster is hideous … Some look just like us”
7621931279	✨Academy of Villains: Lesson in Loyalty✨Author: Ever KingRelease: June 24, 2025Series: Book 2Back at the academy with Ever King’s cast of morally grey and uniquely talented characters, we find ourselves following a new couple and an Aphrodite and Adonis retelling. We continue on our overarching plot, making this sequel most appreciated when read after book one. After the events of book one, the secrets and twists are just getting started. We begin by following Lyla, our forestmage FMC, as she seeks to prove that she is not useless and poor at magic. When a tentative partnership arises with our bad boy alchemist and spiritmage MMC, Bastian, they find that their missions not only run deeper than they ever thought, but they run parallel. However, secrets and loyalty are the fiercest battle in these pages and if they can’t work together, everything may fail. We get more world building, more characters and blooming romances, new heartstrings, more darkness, interesting magics, and higher stakes. The series has continued to get better as we go. Tropes you may find in LIL are reluctant allies to lovers, forced proximity, fated mates, banter, magic, academy setting, wound tending and comfort, she saves him, Greek mythology, medium-low spice, lots of yearning, and an ending that leads to the next fray but not necessarily a cliffhanger. Thank you, Ever and Netgalley, for once again allowing me to be an arc reader.
7622970362	I absolutely devoured this book. I love Bastian and Lyla! I will say with book 1 it took a hot minute to find myself immersed in the story but with this book it was instant, potentially because I was already familiar with the characters. Kores character was a fun villain to add to the mix and the way she manipulated and tortured Bastian was really well explored throughout the book. I enjoyed the fact that Lyla, who was the soft character, ends up being the hero at the end of the day. I don’t think we see enough storyline’s where the female character becomes the badass without becoming dark herself. The emotional turmoil I felt for Bastian was heartbreaking. I was basically screaming at the book to just tell them because they’d understand but alas TRAUMA. I am thoroughly enjoying the magic system in these books. It’s familiar yet in a way that I haven’t necessarily read about before which is really fun. The way Bastian uses his magic during the spicy scene…. SIGN ME UP IMMEDIATELY. I am absolutely begging for the next book. I can’t decide if I want it to be Tobias or Dorian next. Both of their characters have such intriguing things going on that I need to know immediately. Thank you so much to Ever King for allowing me to read an eARC of this book. This is my honest opinion.
7562168805	Thank you to Everkingdom and Netgalley for approving me to read the second book in the series, I’m rating it 4.25 stars.This series has a great way of weaving myth into the story and providing a fresh take, the second book of the series still did this brilliantly. I like our 2 new povs in this book, it expanded on a new path of the story expanding the clues in order for our characters to succeed.There’s still a wonderful build up to any romance included and some mild spice. I am loving the pairings in the series so far and cannot wait to see what characters will be fated to one another.Highly recommend this series for fans of greek mythology, fantasy, prophecies and mystery with stakes.
7160240888	The magic in this story? Pure poetry Butterflies that shift color with emotion, sentient plants, Barklings... I was completely enchanted.The tension between Lyla and Bastian starts off sharp, crackling with animosity, but watching it bloom into something tender and beautiful had me hooked. Add in grimoires, heartstrings, charm cards, and secrets that threaten to unravel everything... completely obsessed -If you love fantasy that feels vividly immersive, layered with emotion, magic, and action, this series is your next obsession.
7156666851	The wicked King of Ithaka will do anything to gain every magic in his palms. Now, he is targeting a set of golden apples, a mythical fruit that whoever eats will gain immortality. He unleashed the Beast of Thorns to gain the apples. The apple is located in the Academy of Magic greenhouse, which is guarded by Lyla Stark. Since the beginning, she has been mysterious as Spring itself and drawn Bastian Lightcroft, one of the Ravens. Everything they meet, everything feels strange, and they start developing friendships, even more. Each of the hiding something dark. They wonder if they should tell each other because once the truths are revealed, they can never be forgiven… Lesson in Loyalty is the second book in the Academy of Villains series. The story more focus on romance and the exploration of the Ithaka Kingdom. The world exploration is combined with treasure hunter vibes. Of course, it’s still the villain who gets the girl, but the romance is pretty intense and the tragedy plus betrayal is very deep. To be honest for a couple, I like Kiara x Lucian more than the main couple in this story. The story and romance type are drastically changed from the first book and slow-paced one. As for combat fighting is still feels lack of action for me. I mean it needs more movement added especially for Bastian, because I feel Dorian's combat fighting movement and style are more stand out than his. Also, the story needs more elements of surprise when fighting the villain. I still like this book, but I ship Kiara x Lucian more. I am looking forward to the next book.
7858048732	If you’re looking for a dark academia romantasy fix with hidden secrets, swoonworthy romance and plenty of action, the Academy of Villains series is for you 😍I read the first book a couple of months ago and was pretty sure that this series would become one of my favourites. After reading Lessons in Loyalty, I absolutely know it’s going to be 💛Following Bastian and Lyla’s story (based on a retelling of Adonis and Aphrodite), Lessons in Loyalty picks up the goings on in the cursed kingdom of Ithaka with ease and I was instantly transported back. The tension between Bastian and Lyla was delicious, the plot was exciting and the world building was excellent. Ever King’s writing really stepped up a notch in this one and I was hooked. Oh and there was a ball - I can’t resist a good ball scene! 💃 Oh and I thought I loved Lucian but Bastian? What a man 😮‍💨😮‍💨 - I bloody love a tortured, morally grey soul and he fits the bill perfectly. I also really enjoyed that we got to learn more about the other guys in the Raven Society and I’m firmly in my ‘why choose?’ era with this lot 👀🤤Lyla’s character arc was heart warming and I actually much preferred her to Kiara. I’m loving the sisterhood with the starmarked though - I adore found family vibes - and I’m super excited to read more, particularly with Bellatrix and Lilith. Another excellent book Ever King - I need Lessons in Trickery immediately!! 💜
7447442283	“He makes me forget that the first bite is always the sweetest before the poison takes hold.”✅ Unique magic system ✅ Strong FMC✅ Steamy romance scenes ✅ Dual POVs ✅ Engaging world building Wow, I absolutely devoured the first book in this series and the second was more than I could have hoped for! The world that Ever King is building here is rich and magical and both the main characters and the side characters are so well fleshed out. The story flows naturally, the dual POVs keep the pace fast and the romance is perfect.Ever King is such a talented writer who has clearly listened to readers feedback after book 1 and fleshed out all the bits that we wanted more on and set the third book up so well - I am DYING to read it! 🥹 give me all the Dorian and Bellatrix vibes! Thank you to NetGalley and the publishers for the ARC!
7819011945	OH. MY. GODDDDD. Ever King, i am so mad i hadn’t read your books sooner. Lessons in Loyalty was such an amazing example of an author going from good writing to FANTASTIC writing !! i was so engaged in the characters, plot, twists, and reveals. i was literally rattling the bars of my enclosure while reading this book. Lyla and Bastian are such real characters in my eyes; Lyla, who just wants to feel confident and have a reliable friend group, and Bastian, who is running from his past by keeping deadly secrets. they are so amazing together (and the slow burn was CRAZY).i also love how the story is progressing. i have a handful of theories as to what is going, but i’m gonna keep my mouth shut because i STILL was taken back at some of the reveals. super super excited for book 3 this fall !!
7562883538	Lessons in Loyalty (Academy of Villains #2) by Ever King picks up with even higher stakes, messy rivalries, and plenty of magic to keep the story moving. The FMC completely stole the spotlight for me—her connection to nature and the way her powers tied into her growth made her my favorite character by far. I loved watching her strength and loyalty shine through, especially as the academy’s twisted politics unfolded. If you like dark academia vibes, strong characters, and a mix of danger and magic, this sequel definitely delivers.Thank you NetGalley for the opportunity to be an ARC reader in exchange for an honest review.
7874994928	Thank you to Ever King for an ARC opportunity!I was worried I would miss reading about Kiera and Lucien, but Lyla and Bastian didn’t disappoint. The sassy banter between the two and I loved watching their relationship grow through the book - the heart string magic still gets me 😭 “Flower girl”????? Yeah, so bye. It makes me GIGGLY.These books are greek mythology retellings which I’m not super familiar with so I don’t have any opinion as to how “good” or “accurate” the retellings are, but they are easy YA reads regardless!
7869703297	Lessons in Loyalty is the second installment in the Academy of Villains series by Ever King. The story follows Bastian and Lyla, a Greek mythology retelling of Adonis and Aphrodite. I loved this so much and book one was hard to beat! The dual POV in the story telling, romance, and the unique world building is top tier. If you love found family, dark academia, Greek mythology retellings, secrets societies, and when the villain gets the girl..this series is 100% for you.
8101576437	I really enjoyed Lessons in Loyalty. I loved Lyla and Bastian even more than Kiara and Lucian. In addition I seeing the same adventure being continued in this part. I am truly invested in this series and cannot wait for more! This book is a dark academia with a romance to swoon over. In addition this book truly is a 'he falls first' with major protection vibes. The romance is so cute, but also really fitting in the somewhat darker storyline.Check out my full review on my blog Boekensteeg
7887989813	I really loved this one. The myths in were greatly described and I can’t wait to read the next installment. Sometimes I found it a bit hard to follow, but by the end it all made sense.
7319110148	Huge thank you to Ever King and netgalley for the ARC! I adored the first book in this series, and the second was just as magical. The mix of Greek mythology and dark academia makes it so unique, and the characters and worldbuilding had me hooked. Special shoutout to the greenhouse scenes and the adorable planty creatures (barklings have my heart 💚). Can’t wait to see where the next books take us!
7817589227	** spoiler alert ** Ever king has done it again!Obsessed doesn't cover how I feel about this book. It felt like a true enemies to lovers brought together by the heartstring. I really wanted to hate Bastion but as the book progressed you learn there is so many layers to him and you end up rooting for him by the end. I am falling more and more in love with this series the more I read. Thank you to Netgalley for the ARC.
7749857105	Thank you so much for another ARC and another amazing story! This is the second book in the series! They are interconnected and must be read it order but I love how they are about different characters! In this story we learn much more about Bastian (& bits and pieces of the rest of the Raven society) as well as Lyla (& we get more of Kiara and Octavia) I really enjoyed both Bastian and Lyla coming together and the things they go through and have to overcome! I also loved all the little elements that totally gave me sailor moon vibes 🥰 Ever King does great job of setting us up for the next book and I am SO excited for that couple!
7809554358	5/5⭐️ Had so much fun reading this book! Lyla and Bastian melt my heart🥹 I have a few theories on certain things which I’m assuming we’ll find out about in book 3… but we’ll just have to wait and see🤫🤭Bring on book 3💅
7670953887	4.5/5The world building for this book was amazing. Throughout the book, I felt like I was there and I could vividly see many of the different scenes in my mind. I also thought that this book was paced perfectly. There was a perfect blend of world building scenes to plot / action scenes, which helped move the book along nicely. I also didn’t know what to expect going into this book and I was not disappointed. I loved that this book was dual pov so we were able to get both Bastian, our mmc, and Lyla’s, our fmc, povs. I found my self excited to read both character’s perspectives and I never wanted to skip any chapters since I connected so easily with these characters. It was also great to see Lucian and Kiara again from book 1, and I am very interested in the characters Dorian and Tobias now. I thought that the beginning was a little slow and hard to get into, but once I was able to get more comfortable with the main characters, the book was great. Thank you for allowing me to read an eARC of this book for an honest review. Can’t wait for the next book!
7802560054	Atleast I can still feel my heart It really just keeps getting better and better with each story. ( I really did miss Lucian and Kiara's point of view) But I'm learning being on the edge of my seat and full of suspense of what going to happen. The tension between the main love pair is amazing. Love Bastian.
7208306936	The Honest Bunny Review:https://www.instagram.com/thehonestbu...Rating:🐇🐇🐇🐇/5“Love is a promise. Loyalty is keeping it.”The narrative continues to unfold. Academy of Villains: Lessons in Loyalty was magnificent. I had truly a remarkable time spending this time with Bastian and Lyla. The first book was extremely action-packed. It was a great example of being plot driven – jumping right into the action. I think book two really showcased the beauty of a character driven story. It had a healthy dose of plot and intrigue but allowed a deeper look into the characters – their fears, flaws, intentions and their hearts. I was completely awestruck by Lyla from the very first chapter. We LOVE a Forestmage. She is literally Mother Earth incarnate. I resonated a lot with her. “She’s all contradictions. Soft but stubborn. Gentle but unshaken. She carries herself like she’s delicate, but I’ve seen the way she stands her ground – not with force, but with a quiet defiance that never wavers. Maybe that’s what draws me to her – the quiet kind of resilience that bends but never breaks.” She has such a soft nature that often does not get taken seriously and wants to be recognized for her strength, but she needs to embody that power. I think many women can relate to Lyla’s struggle. Kiara is often revered for her power but there is also immense strength in being soft and embracing one’s true self. I think Lyla was able to demonstrate that nuance beautifully. BASTIAN. Someone just needed to give this man a damn hug. He is such a sweet, soft man that has been hardened and victimized by his circumstances. I really enjoyed reading about his capabilities as a Spiritmage. That was a very new concept for me and I was transfixed. Bastian is the definition of a protector, and we love to see it. “I’d walk into the darkness. Face whatever monsters lay in wait. If it meant keeping her safe. It’s not a grand, heroic notion. It’s a raw truth that crawls beneath my skin, more instinct than intention.”I ALSO LOVE THE FEMALE EMPOWERMENT. The women and their friendship in this series is just top tier. I cannot wait for the rest of the series. I am desperately waiting for my Kaspian book – OH LORD THAT MAN IS FINE. I am so proud to be member of the Royal Court of the Everkingdom. I had the pleasure of reading the Lessons in Loyalty eArc provided via Netgalley for my honest review! Thank you so much to Ever King for this opportunity. Mark your calendars – this will be available on June 24th. Always remember, reading is extremely personal and very subjective, we are all allowed to have different opinions. That is absolutely okay and beautiful. Happy reading. ✨🩷🫶
7671378712	I need book 3 immediately, please and thank you!This second book continues the journey into a magical kingdom under the rule of an evil(?) god, following the students who are determined to save their friend, the prince, and the rest of the kingdom.In this installment, our focus shifts to two compelling new characters: Lyla and Bastian. Lyla, a forest mage, lives in the greenhouse and is initially portrayed as beautiful, desirable, and meek. Bastian is almost her exact opposite – a spirit mage and a member of the Raven Society, those who serve the crown. He's tragically forced to betray his friends by the Beast of Thorns, Kore, in a desperate effort to keep his family safe.The two are undeniably pulled toward one another, yet secrets continually keep them apart. Despite this, they are repeatedly brought together by their burgeoning desire for each other, but also by their individual missions to protect the kingdom.Lyla's personal journey in this book is particularly engaging as she learns to step into her own power and understand what it truly means to be a starmarked warrior. It was also genuinely lovely to see her begin to forge friendships with Octavia and Kiara, especially given her initial isolation.I truly enjoyed how much of the overarching plot this story began to flesh out. I can now see so many different avenues this series can explore, and there are so many characters whose perspectives I would absolutely love to see going forward. I want to learn more about the witches, and I'm deeply curious about the deal between Tobias and Octavia. Simply put, I just want more! The world-building in this series is exceptionally well done, a true masterclass in taking classical Greek stories and completely re-imagining them. I genuinely love this series and will continue to devour these books as long as Ever King writes them. There's such a rich tapestry to explore, and I often wish I could just immerse myself in this world to uncover all of its secrets.
7554801716	Rating: 4.75/5 ⭐️Spice: 🌶️🌶️Academy of Villians — Lessons in Loyalty 🌼🗡️🦋I just wrapped up the second installment in the Academy of Villains series, Lessons in Loyalty by @authoreverking —and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. This book dives deeper into the perspectives of supporting characters introduced in the debut novel, offering fresh insight and emotional depth that really enriched the story.At the heart of this book is the evolving dynamic between Bastian Lightcroft and Lyla Stark. And let’s be honest—any character with the last name Stark instantly has my loyalty (bend the knee, anyone? 😉).Lyla Stark is a forest mage who initially appears to be the embodiment of innocence. Quiet and reserved, she spends her time tending the academy’s greenhouse and staying out of the spotlight. Nicknamed the “Flower Girl,” she’s often underestimated—until she finds her people. With the encouragement and camaraderie of her newfound girl gang, Kiara and Octavia, Lyla begins to come into her own. Together, the trio works to uncover the mysteries surrounding the Cursed King and the kingdom’s fate, aided by the secretive Raven Society.Then there’s our new MMC, Bastian Lightcroft, a powerful Spirit Mage with the ability to summon spirits from his grimoire. Bound by a forced allegiance to the king, Bastian faces a test of loyalty—not just to others, but to himself. As the story unfolds, we learn more about his complicated family history and watch how Lyla, quietly unravels his world in the warmest way.I personally loved Lyla’s character. She isn’t the typical “badass” female lead who’s been trained for battle her whole life. Instead, she’s pure, kind, and sincere. She wears her heart on her sleeve and leads with empathy, making her a refreshing and deeply loyal companion. Watching her grow into her strength in her own unique way was one of my favorite aspects of the book.This sequel continues to build beautifully on the foundation laid in Book 1, adding complexity to the plot and deepening the world. I’m genuinely impressed by how the series is unfolding, revealing answers while keeping the intrigue alive through Ever King’s captivating storytelling.
7653138824	Thank you Ever King and NetGalley for this ARC.Even though this story follows Lyla and Bastian the story still continues where it left off in book 1 it’s just different POVs. So you will want to read book 1 before you read this book. Lyla and Bastian are an interesting pair. Forestmage and spiritmage both with their own secrets. What happens if the secrets are revealed? Why was Bastian so secretive in the first book and seemed a little suspicious? What happens when a heartstring is added to the mix? It makes so much sense now when it comes to Bastian especially when you read his POV for the first time. The secrets, why he acts how he does, I knew there was something but wasn’t expecting what it actually was. I felt for him when reading his POV and the things going through his head. I’m going to be honest and say for the first half I wasn’t so sure about Lyla. A few of the things she did had me thinking I don’t like where this is going. The second half made up for it and I did end up liking her it just took a little bit. Once I learned more about a few of the people involved in some of her decisions I understood a little bit more and didn’t think it was as bad. It all ended up making sense by the end. While Lucian and Kiara aren’t the main characters you still do get to see them with a chapter in their POV each which I really liked. The things we learned in this book answered some of my questions from book 1 but at the same time left me with more questions and no answers yet. Overall I really liked this book and can’t wait to see what the next one brings. That ending and especially the epilogue had me wanting more.
7155224620	I’m a proud member of Ever King’s Royal Court of the Everkingdom—huge thanks to Ever King for letting me be part of this amazing community and for the chance to read this eARC!Lessons in Loyalty picks up right after book one but shifts the spotlight to two previous side characters—Lyla and Bastain. Lyla is a forestmage (which I LOVE) who is a student at the academy while also tending to the academy's greenhouse. She’s soft and gentle but has that quiet strength I’ve really been into lately. Bastain, a spiritmage (also LOVE), is part of the Raven Society and has definitely been through it, taking care of the King. He’s a bit hardened on the outside, but underneath, he’s super compassionate and just... so sweet. These two balance each other perfectly, and I adored watching their relationship grow.In book one, I felt like the plot moved a little too fast, so I really appreciated that this book slowed things down and focused more on the characters. It was so nice to really get to know them while still moving the story forward in a way that felt natural. There is a natural progression of deepening friendships which also added to the overall story. Plus, we got some great setup for other characters I’m already dying to read more about (TOBIAS... just, wow).Easily a 5-star read for me. This book felt like it was made just for me, and I couldn’t be happier. If you haven’t started this series yet—do it! It’s such a fun ride and only getting better!
7568312297	Academy of Villains returns with even more magic, mystery, and intrigue in this thrilling second installment of the series. While book one introduced us to the wonders—and dangers—of the magical academy, book two pulls back the curtain even further to reveal the secrets the magical world has been hiding all along.This time, the spotlight shifts to Lyla, a quiet but powerful forest mage who prefers the company of plants to people. She spends her days in the academy’s greenhouse, avoiding attention despite the many admirers who are drawn to her.Enter Bastian, a conflicted spirit mage caught between his obligations and his own desires. With his playful nickname for Lyla—"flower girl"—he slowly becomes a part of her world, even as both are pulled deeper into the academy’s darker truths.Fans of the first book will enjoy seeing familiar faces while getting to know Lyla and Bastian, whose dynamic adds fresh emotional depth and tension to the unfolding story.If you love magical academies, layered characters, and slow-burning secrets, Academy of Villains book two delivers on all fronts.Happy reading!
7268777451	As I'm beginning to realise, every book I read of Ever King's (past and future), I will adore and have adored. I cannot begin to explain how much I enjoyed reading this book. This story has so many meanings and messages that make reading it much more than just escapism. Lyla and Bastian were everything of course but the friendships and difficulties they face together also shine through and how they grow together. I also loved the female friendships and support and how even though two friends may seem close, there's always room for more. You must read Ever King's books now and in the future because if you don't you are truly missing out. You get to escape to a world far away but feel part of it through her writing. If you like romantasy then I would definitely recommend the Academy of Villains. This book series is meant for you if you want more than escapism (thank you Ever King). I cannot wait to read the next book (literally I can't wait). Thank you to net galley, the publisher and Ever King for allowing me to receive an ARC in exchange for my honest review.

7206181469	A big thank you to NetGalley and Ever King for the opportunity to read an ARC of Lessons in Loyalty in exchange for an honest review.Lessons in Loyalty is the second installment in Ever King’s Academy of Villains series, and it absolutely lived up to my expectations after loving book one. I’ve always had a soft spot for myth retellings, and Ever King continues to shine in this genre.In this book, we follow Lyla Stark, a mage at the Academy of Magic, who crosses paths with the dark and brooding Bastian Lightcroft. Their story is a captivating retelling of the myth of Adonis and Aphrodite, reimagined with a unique twist that blends fantasy, romance, and danger.This was a solid 4-star read for me. The balance between action and romance was spot-on, and the world-building really stepped up in this sequel. We’re introduced to intriguing new characters, and the stakes are clearly rising, making it easy to get swept up in the story. I’m genuinely excited to see where Ever King takes this series next!
7580332664	After reading the first installment in Academy of Villians, I honestly didn’t think that anything could top it. I am so glad to be proved wrong! Lyla and Bastian are the two characters I wanted to learn more about from the very beginning. Both are such complex characters and it was so nice to experience their journey. I loved their character development & the struggles they both overcame in this story. Bastions journey as a friend and a mage was one that I think all of us can relate to. Torn between duty to his king and whats in his heart was something that I really enjoyed seeing unfold. Now Lyla? Lyla was the person that I anticipated to become such a vital part of this trilogy and that she did! Fighting self doubt and learning just how powerful she truly is exactly what I was hoping for! Thank you to Ever King and NetGalley for an early copy of this book! I loved it and can’t wait for book 3!
7644117191	This is book two in the series. If you have not read book one, I suggest you do! It's Good, but in my opinion, book two is even better. I love Lyla! She comes off as sweet and innocent, but don’t let that fool you because the girl can care for herself. Bastian comes off as mysterious, and morally gray. The tension, banter, and spice between these two were on point!Believe it or not, I love me a Villain so I loved Kore as a character😈The magic system, the magical objects just all the details that went into this book-this whole series is so good.💛Grumpy x Sunshine💛Rivals to Lovers💛Secret Societies💛Magic Academy 💛Fated Bonds/Heartsrings💛Morally Gray MMC💛Slow-Burn Tension & SpiceIf this is your vibe then this is your book!!
7851168432	If Academy of Villains hooked me with Kiara and Lucian, then Lessons in Loyalty tore me apart and stitched me back together with Lyla and Bastian. I didn’t expect to love them—I really didn’t. In book one, Bastian was the arrogant thorn in everyone’s side. In book two, he became the thorn that blooms into something heartbreakingly beautiful.Ever King leans into the myth of Aphrodite and Adonis, crafting a story where love, loyalty, and betrayal are dangerous currencies. What undid me most was Bastian’s internal war: the secrets he can’t reveal, the lies he hates himself for, and the suffocating loneliness of it all. “The hardest part about lying to my friends is knowing that they believe me. Trust is supposed to feel good. Instead, it feels like chains tightening around my throat.” His conflict is constant, but beneath it is the simplest desire—to be seen, to be fought for, to be worthy of love.And then there’s Lyla. Graceful, untouchable, endlessly pursued—yet she says, “I’ve been adored, pursued, worshiped—yet I have never belonged to anyone.” That line defines her. Flowers bloom for their own sake, not to be owned, and Lyla embodies that. But what makes her arc so powerful here is how she allows herself to be vulnerable with Bastian, even when she doesn’t want to.Their relationship is the star of this book—volatile, protective, aching with unspoken truths. Bastian’s arrogance becomes a mask for something deeper, and the way he shifts from tormentor to protector is perfection:“Why do you call me flower girl? .... Because you bloom, despite all the rot in this world. And that… that makes you rare.”“I’m staying. I’m not leaving you like this. Not tonight.”“Go to sleep,” he murmurs. “I’m not going anywhere.”And then there’s the claiming, the moments that ruin both of them:“You’re mine now, Lyla. Say it.” … “I’m yours,” I whisper.“He looked at me like I was something sacred.”“Like he’s holding onto something he doesn’t want to lose.”But threaded through all the tenderness is poison. Lyla admits, “He was the poison in my veins, and I savored every drop.” And Bastian knows it too—“Bastian Lightcroft is temptation incarnate—he makes me forget that the first bite is always the sweetest before the poison takes hold.” They both recognise the danger, both know they should stay away, and yet neither of them can. That inevitability makes every stolen moment between them feel like a slow fall they can’t stop.This isn’t just lust or chemistry—it’s desperation, possession, and the kind of devotion that makes you believe Bastian would burn the world for her. The end leaves no doubt: Lyla is the one thing he cannot let go of, even if it destroys him.What makes their story so devastating is the duality. Lyla sees the danger in him—“Bastian Lightcroft is dangerous… because he makes me want things I shouldn’t.” And Bastian knows he doesn’t deserve her—“I don’t deserve her softness. I was meant for darkness and damnation, not the delicate hands of a woman who makes flowers bloom wherever she walks.” Yet he still stays. Still protects. Still aches for her to choose him.The wider arc builds beautifully—curses, betrayals, shifting allegiances—and though my heart is still tied to Kiara and Lucian, I’m terrified for what’s coming. Ever King has laid the groundwork for something explosive, and I’m clinging to hope that my heart won’t shatter completely in book three.Lessons in Loyalty is a breathtaking, bruising sequel. Bastian and Lyla’s bond is dangerous, tender, and unforgettable—a reminder that sometimes the greatest villainy is daring to love when the world insists you shouldn’t.
7986161855	Okay so I went into this book 100% blind. I had NO CLUE what this one would be about, who the focus was, the mythology pairings. Nothing. And I'm so glad that I did. I jumped into this one ASAP after falling in love with the first book. I thought I loved Lucian and Kiara, and I do. I really do love them.... But then Bastian got screentime GALORE along with Lyla. And I am HEAD OVER HEELS OBSESSED WITH THESE TWO. Their story is just so freaking wonderful and their moments they have are filled with tension, longing, intrigue, hesitancy, hope, mystery, need and also some sorrow and anger sprinkled into the mix. All the ingredients together, mixed in thoroughly and then put that in the oven and it came out to the MOST AMAZING CAKE EVER. Okay though seriously the story. I was already hooked on the world and it's uniqueness. The Academy, the Mage types and their powers, the Forsaken and the Nameless and of course the King. This world is shrouded in mystery that even the inhabitants aren't aware of and slowly as the threads start to come unraveled, we get more and more information. I might as well have my Kindle app looking like a coloring book with this one because I got trigger happy with highlights. There's just so many moments that felt important, that had me thinking back to other parts of the story. Because I went into this blind, I had given my friend a guess as to who the male character would be for this one and I was just like Bastian. period. I wasn't wrong. I've come up with my theories for books to come and hopeful books as I made SEVERAL theory line-ups with this one... But this story... Bastian really comes into himself as a character especially as we have more about him revealed throughout the story in such wondrous ways and it made him absolutely endearing to me. Lyla? She's amazing. She doubts herself and with the right push from Bastian she starts to learn more about herself, the world, and her powers than she could have even imagined. Her magic is also really cool with the butterflies and we get comments from Bastian about things like How am I supposed to be able to read your mood without your butterflies? She's fierce in her own way, loyal, headstrong and she sells herself way to short. The development we see between both characters had me laughing and smiling with joy and even a moment where I started to cry.If you're questioning the need to read these books..... Don't question it. Do you like mythology within the pages of your stories? Do you also like the additional info at the end of the books where you find out the inspiration to the mythology? Amazing character development? A theory puzzle that makes you want to keep guessing and changing information every time you find out something new? Read. This. Book. Well-read both of these as this is book 2. I fell in love so fast and hard with these books that I dropped into my friends DMs, theory dropped in mine and my friends discord group, dropped into the author's DMs, signed up for the street team and then continued DMing my friend while she's busy life-ing and I'm here spiraling.
7152661498	** spoiler alert ** As a member of the Royal Court of Ever King, I'm able to ARC read the academy of Villains books when they are ready to be proof read. I'm so blessed with the opportunity to do so. This book is the second Academy of Villains book called "Lessons in Loyalty" and will be released on the 24th of June and is categorized as a Greek mythology / dark fantasy novel. I loved the first book, uncovering heartstrings and unlocking them for all of the other people out there. A heartstring is a bit like a soulmate but on another level, a tether of sorts. Dark magic roaming the kingdom, a king that's nothing more than a vessel. Kiara and prince Lucian are the main characters in book 1. In this book, we still follow Kiara and Prince Lucian, but have a new pair of Main characters.. Lyla, the girl from the greenhouse and Bastian, alchemist and member of the raven society. This storyline is also enemies to lovers but the story from the first book progresses. With the king being possessed by a God named Moros, and the Darkwing Bloodline being nothing more than a vessel of sorts, Lucian is struggling, is his father truly gone? Lost to this god? Lyla, Kiara and Octavia are studying about starwarriors and how to access their pendents but also train with Bastian to learn how to fight in combat and how to be more confident in casting magic. The way the greenhouse is described is so magical. The butterflies... Surreal. I really liked to get to know Lyla better and how misunderstood Bastian really is. How the love progresses, or lust?Bastian is a guy with soooo many secrets, with the amount of secrets and the danger of some of them coming to light or the danger of people getting hurt he keeps everyone at arms length, no one truly knows him, not even his "brothers" from the raven society. His association with the beast of thorns and how deep his tasks for the king are.. He will open up, eventually. The story is somewhat slow paced, it's really story building with a lot of.. How do I say it? Extended descriptions? Let me explain, if a read a few lines and close my eyes, I can actually imagine seeing it in my mind. This quote was my favorite, Bastian is the one that says it "better to die chasing something extraordinary than live ordinary. The line that actually made me roll my eyes because this line is used way to much in stories by all different authors is " I let out a breath I didn't realise I was holding " or a variety of it. It's in this book 3 times (maybe more) I really dislike that line. But the story, the backstory, the fantasy, the details and the enemies to lovers keeps me hooked. 4,5 stars from me.
7740714854	Ever King has done it again - I am absolutely obsessed with the magic system, lore, and characters she’s created and will always be chomping at the bit for more from this world.We pick up where we left off in the last book, but now focus on the story of Bastian and Lyla which takes on a dislike to lovers twist. Each book focuses on a Greek mythology retelling, with this book being Adonis x Aphrodite. I found this story to be a perfect balance of plot progression and swoonworthy romance. The plot thickens, the lore deepens, and Moros’s cruelty knows no bounds.Bastian is someone who has to keep everyone at arms length as he’s being strong-armed by the big bad Moros into betraying his fellow Raven Society members. And because of that, he has never allowed himself to fully open up to others. But we soon bear witness to him slowly falling for our resident flower girl Lyla. Lyla is initially portrayed as someone soft, but it’s been a treat to watch her transition from being afraid of her own potential and instead, embracing it.I truly loved the depth of Bastian and Lyla’s dynamic and how we get to see every step of the way as their relationship transitions from dislike to love. Plus the scenes of possessiveness, protectiveness, and care that Bastian shows Lyla are just top tier. Our Raven Society boys know how to protect their Heartstrings let me just say that. And what’s better, is that Lyla also has her turn to protect/save him as well…in quite a badass way! I swear I was highlighting sooo many romantic moments because this book was full of them! Now, their road was not easy as it was brimming with betrayal and secrets. But watching them accept and choose each other despite everything has my heart so full! Also, the spice was impeccable!I swear my book boyfriend rankings from this series keep changing the more I get to know each character. Bastian has now shot up to number 2 (behind Tobias because… well, he’s Tobias), but now I feel like even that isn’t set in stone given the scenes we get from Dorian this book! Gah… I cannot wait for book 3!If you are a fan of Sailor Moon, a story that can SO easily translate into an anime in your head, unique magic systems and lore, and a large cast of diverse characters that you will be invested in - please pick up this series! You will not be disappointed!Thank you Ever King for the eARC in exchange for my honest review!Tropes:- Possessive MMC- Adonis x Aphrodite retelling- Grumpy x Sunshine- They save each other- Secrets & betrayal- Fated Bonds (Heartstrings)
8072531279	In this second book of the series the story concentrates on Lyla Stark and Bastian Lightcroft.Lyla is not only any student at the Academy of Magic. She is the girl living in the greenhouse and taking care of the tree with the golden apples. These apples are harvest by the Oracle herself. She has many suitors but is not interested in any of them. This is changing when she meeting more and more often Bastian, one of the Ravens.He has very dark secrets as he is not even telling the Ravens what missions the evil king binds him to do by threatening not only his live but the one of his remaining family.Both in their own ways try to find a way to fight against the king and to keep the ones they love and their friends save. Both need to uncover hidden secrets and they must face their greatest fears in hope finding a way to win against the king. For me a really good follow up! Now that we already know most of the characters, now already some details about the world it make so much fun to learn and explore more.This book is in my opinion darker and much more is at stake here.I really like that the question what lies can a love and friendships endure comes up here and for me it is really well written. So many characters have so different secrets as they think it is for the better.Also to read how friendships become closer, new allies and friends are found, how they try to trust each other is good written.When the book starts you think Lyla is in need of a hero. Bit by bit we get to know her better and she is trusting more and more herself, what she can do and together with her female friends she is getting stronger during this book. I really enjoyed reading her development and how she gets stronger and stronger here.I felt so sorry for Bastian right from the start. What he had and has to endure to keep his family save is so unbelievable! That he doesn´t want to listen to his heart and stay away from Lyla to make sure she is save shows his good heart no matter all the evil things he had to do.I liked how their relationship evolved. For me it was well written.So beside the spice we have between these two and also between Kiara and Lucian the characters development continues and we learn what journey they need to do to help the bigger picture here to support their quest to win against a good which is not willing to lose the reign over the kingdom. I couldn´t but down this book and I am looking forward what expects us in the next book of this series.
7366948334	📚 Book Review 📚 .Series: Academy of Villians 📚: Lessons in Loyalty ✍️: @everkingGenre: Dark Academia Romantasy.First of all thank you @everking and @netgalley for the opportunity to read this ARC! .This book is book 2 in the Academy of Villians series.

7903847808	** spoiler alert ** Academy of Villains: Lessons in Loyalty by Ever King. Book 2 in the Academy of Villains series.*** Disclosure: I was given an ARC copy by the author in exchange for an HONEST review***Now to the nitty gritty….First and foremost, I LIKED this book. There was some obvious improvement in the writing from the first book which was pleasing. The pacing in this book was consistent all the way through in my opinion, however, I do kind of wish there was more DRAMA. 😂 Like I’m lowkey disappointed with the resolution to Devlin?? I felt like there could’ve been more anticipation/suspense throughout the book connected to that which would’ve left me on the edge of my seat.. (I’m just a weirdo who loves it when books throw my emotions around all over the place like a rag doll). In my review for the first book, I believe my biggest critique was that I felt like a bystander most of the time just standing on the outside of the scenes/not really involved in the story, and I’m happy to say that in this second book, the descriptions of each setting/scene was so much better and it truly felt like I was right there with Lyla & Bastian.. Now I think I might even like Lyla & Bastian even more than Kiara & Lucian 🤭 .. I just felt like the pining between the two of them was ✨immaculate ✨ AND THE PART WHEN LYLA NURSES HIM BACK TO HEALTH!!! *internally screaming* something about a complete badass FMC still being soft and slipping into a care taker role just does something to me!! 😩 My only complaint really, as someone who loves emotionally devastating books, was that there were a few parts where I felt the emotional impact could’ve been more if I wasn’t told what I should feel and just kinda eluded to, but that didn’t really have any influence to my rating so I guess just a mini critique 🙂I am so excited to see whose story comes next! I have two couples in mind that I would absolutely die to see as the main characters in the next book 🤍I believe this book is still rated as YA, however, it did have more of an open door romance in this installment so although I still would recommend it, I’d just add a disclaimer for those who prefer closed door books and younger readers! 😊
7696708233	5⭐2🌶️This sequel was everything I wanted and then some.Where book one plants the seeds of the Academy of Magic’s richly layered world, book two lets them take root and bloom—exploring shadowy landscapes, deepening the unique magic system, and giving character arcs that feel both gorgeous and achingly real. It’s the kind of continuation that doesn’t just follow in book one’s footsteps, but lets the story flourish.Ever King has this way of folding Greek mythology into her stories that is downright addictive. And as someone who lives for clever little Easter eggs, I was grinning the whole way through. The way she layers detail—across her books and even into her social media presence—makes the entire experience feel seamless, intentional, and incredibly satisfying.Now, I’ll admit, this review took me forever to write. Not because I didn’t know what to say, but because I had too much to say. My brain has been running laps ever since I finished (the 19 pages of notes in my Google Doc would like a word). But that’s what happens when a story fully captivates me. Some might call it obsessed … I prefer thorough. Either way, this is a world I fell into and had zero desire to climb back out of.Vibe-wise, book one was dark, suspenseful, and menacing. Book two, while still heavy with haunting beauty, pulls back the curtain on truth, trust, and relationships—and I found myself hooked all over again. Lyla’s arc was stunning: she begins hesitant, battling self-doubt, but through challenges and her growing bond with Bastian, she steps into her own power. What I loved most is that her transformation isn’t loud or in-your-face—it’s quiet strength, steady and sure, which makes it all the more powerful (and honestly, refreshing).And then there’s Bastian. I don’t buy the “villain gets the girl” label here. He’s not some one-note dark love interest. Yes, he’s done some VERY bad things, but he’s a survivor, doing what he must to protect himself and his family. That mask of arrogance he wears hides a depth that’s worth every slow reveal.If I had to distill the vibe of this book into two words, they’d be: effortless and haunting. The writing builds lush, cinematic visuals without ever dragging, the mythology seamlessly flows, and the emotional undercurrent makes it impossible not to care.In short: this series is absolutely one to get lost in—and trust me, you’ll want to.What to expect:🏛️Adonis x Aphrodite🌤️Grumpy x Sunshine⚔️Rivals to Lovers💕Found Family🔑Secret Societies🪄Magic Academy💫Fated Bonds/Heartstrings🩶Morally grey, protective, & lightly possessive MMC↔️Push and Pull🔥Slow Burn🦋Found Power🖤Dark Academia❤️‍🔥Romantasy🌸Gorgeous & Underestimated FMC🩷💚🩷💚
7535536466	Yes!!! This book absolutely delivered—and at a much quicker pace than the first one, which made it such a fun and thrilling ride. Ever King is killing it with this series!✨ Spoiler-Free Summary:The crew is back, piecing together clues and mysterious necklaces… all while leveling up their gardening game. We get a deeper look into Mr. Sketchypants himself—Bastian—and trust me, it’s a side you won’t expect. A surprising new romance blooms (and nope, it’s not the one you’re thinking of!). Meanwhile, a certain predator finally gets what’s coming to him after harassing a very important flower—wink wink.🌟 Vibes & Themes:This installment moves at a much quicker, more engaging pace, which made the mystery-solving even more enjoyable. There’s a delicious game of cat and mouse filled with tension that builds until two characters finally confess their feelings. The romantic tension is chef’s kiss.What really stood out was the strong sense of female empowerment. The women in this book support each other fiercely and don’t rely on the guys to put the puzzle pieces together. It’s refreshing to see women solving problems, backing each other up, and growing into their own.Character development continues to shine—each character is on their own journey, and the way their partners support them (without overstepping) was beautifully written. Respect, boundaries, and growth all get a moment in the spotlight.🏫 Other Highlights:The school setting still adds charm, and the group shenanigans are as entertaining as ever.The FIGHT SCENE? Iconic. Flower finally serves Grunge Regina George the audacity she’s been carrying around, and it’s so satisfying.Loved the underlying message: You can be independent and happy on your own—but having a supportive partner doesn’t take away from that. It’s a powerful and positive takeaway for readers.🔥 Spice Level: 2/5A slow burn with some heat, but the focus is definitely on character and relationship development.🌸 Final Thoughts:I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait to see where it goes next! Ever King has created a world that’s fun, empowering, romantic, and just a little dangerous—and I’m here for all of it.Tropes:Magic Touch her and dieClosed Proximity Gods/Witches Falls fast
7746263895	Lessons in Loyalty is the second installment in the Academy of Villains series by Ever King 🪴Picking up after Academy of Villains, this book shifts the spotlight to two side characters, whose story draws inspiration from the myth of Aphrodite and Adonis, infused with a dark, magical twist.Magic is vanishing. The kingdom teeters on the brink of collapse, and the cruel king who rules it all is obsessed with claiming the legendary golden apples of immortality. Ruthless in his pursuit, he’lldestroy anyone who dares to stand in his way.Lyla Stark is the strong and independent carer of the greenhouse at The Academy of Mages and she loathes Bastion Lightcroft. Bastion Lightcroft is a clever and cunning mage who is well versed in stealing from Lyla’s greenhouse and harbouring dangerous secrets. They were never meant to trust each other, let alone fall for each other.But as destinies entwine and the stakes rise, Bastion and Lyla must decide: protect their hearts, or risk everything for a love that could change the fate of their world. While the setting is familiar, Lessons in Loyalty introduces an entirely new mystery, a fresh slow-burn romance, and a chilling new threat that looms over the academy.If you're drawn to dark academia laced with myth, magic, and morally gray characters, the Academy of Villains series is for you! I enjoyed this book more than the first! 😍 I liked Layla and Bastion and the tension between the two was 🔥! I think both characters had more depth and backstory which was helped by their presence in book 1. Thank you to NetGalley for my review copy.
7234365798	《 ARC REVIEW 》"Maybe the greatest dangers aren’t the gods we remember, but the ones we’ve forgotten."☆☆☆☆I just finished reading the second book in the Academy of Villains series, Lessons in Loyalty by Ever King! This one picks up after the events of the first book but mainly follows Lyla and Bastian. They are both mages at the Academy of Magic in Ithaka, where Lyla is a Forestmage that tends to the greenhouse and Bastian is a Spiritmage who is part of the Raven Society. Bastian has a tendency to steal from the greenhouse, and Lyla can't stand him or trust him for that matter... until she starts falling for him. Bastian is hiding some deadly secrets, though, and it all starts to unravel once Lyla gets pulled into his life. I really enjoyed reading from Bastian's point of view! And his banter, not only with Lyla but Samson!! He's also dark and brooding, and it's perfect! This book is so full of mystery, action, and magic! While Kiara, Octavia, and Lyla try to figure out more about the pendants and their magic, Bastian is struggling with his own battles, like dealing with Kore and Moros. It really picks up in the second half of the book, and gets intense! You'll love this book if you like: Greek mythology Politics Dark academia Secret societies Fated mates Mages & magicForced proximity Hogwarts x Gossip GirlThis book just got released on June 24th, and is available to read now!!A huge thank you to Ever King for the opportunity to read this ARC. These are my honest thoughts and opinions.
7254821776	Thank you to the author and publisher for providing me with an e-ARC via NetGalley! That in no way influenced my review of the book and all opinions are my own. Ever King cannot write a bad book. Like it isn’t possible. Everything she touches is pure GOLD and I am so here for it. I would give her my soul if that’s what she wanted because I am so devoted to this series. My favourite parts were the angst and the pining. The emotions within this book were so raw and open, and I love the different character POVs. It really helps us to get into the characters minds and understand their thoughts and feelings. Bastian is so pure and I just want to protect him with my life 🥹 Lyla is also incredible and I love a female character who has her own stuff sorted and doesn’t rely on anyone else for support. The fact that she’s a gardener and a forest mage makes my heart so happy. And the Barklings?! SQUEEEEE I love them The world building is one of my favourite things of this series. The descriptions are so beautifully vivid and I find it really easy to picture the scenes in my head. Especially the library and the celestial sky!! This book was a good mix of plot and character building. It flowed really well and I found it so easy to follow. There’s a really nice mix of characters that are different, and god my heart hurts for Tobias, I want to protect him and keep him safe forever!! I’m so thankful to be part of this community that Ever has built! Rating: 5/5 stars (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)
7892245942	A huge thank you to Ever King and NetGalley for the eARC of this book Oh my goodness I LOVE LYLA AND BASTIAN SO MUCH I WANT MORE OF THEM - ugh the tension the romance the yearning, everything was perfection 💋So this book picks up from where the last one left off and we’re immediately thrust into Lyla and Bastian’s story. One thing I want to mention before I get into the review: I absolutely love how the author made this book so unique to these two characters, despite following on from the same storyline and having the same setting, side characters, etc. Lyla is soft and feminine and we see her character development throughout the book and she ends up being a complete badass - this progression was absolutely incredible. I appreciate how well paced it was and it felt like we were discovering Lyla’s strengths and powers as she was, and it was so special to see her journey and experience it this way. In a similar way, thanks to the dual POV, we saw Bastian going on his secret missions and the struggles he faced with his own self and everything he went through. I liked how this side of him wasn’t explained from the start so it left some doubt within me but then things got explained later on and made so much sense. Once again, it felt like I was unraveling the story simultaneously with the characters themselves! Also, I’m noticing a pattern in these books, which is that the characters go on these journeys by themselves which help them discover their true powers and it leads to character development as well as plot progression - and IM LOVING IT!! I am so excited to see how these personal journeys will differ across the books, because just these two books have already shown a variety of journeys the characters went through, with Kiara and Lucian going through trial-like challenges, and Lyla and Bastian going through a more combat focused journey. It’s so creative how these are so unique fitted to their specific characters, and I really appreciate the writing for that. Omg also, the Kiara and Lucian plot twist took me as much by surprise as it did them, and I’m so excited to see how that storyline progresses. Overall, an incredible read and I cannot wait for the next book💛😍
7686554030	In a kingdom where magic is fading and a ruthless king will stop at nothing to gain more power, the hunt begins for the golden apples of immortality, protected by mage Lyla Stark.When Lyla is unexpectedly bound by a magical Heartstring to the enigmatic Bastian Lightcroft - a man full of secrets and danger who can’t seem to stay away - everything begins to unravel. As dark magic spreads and truths are exposed, loyalties are tested, hearts are shaken, and Lyla must face one haunting question: can some truths ever be forgiven?My thoughts: This is the second installment in the Academy of Villains series, and I’ve been hooked since the first book. I couldn’t wait to dive back into this world, and I was really looking forward to what would happen next.I’ll be honest..I expected this book to follow the main characters from Book 1 more closely, so I was surprised when the focus shifted to Lyla (our flower girl 🥺) and Bastian. But it didn’t take long for me to fall in love with them too. This sequel is definitely more character-driven, centering on their story, though the worldbuilding remains rich and immersive.That said, the slower pacing did stand out a bit for me. It wasn’t as fast paced as I had hoped, but the emotional depth and character development made up for it.Expect more heart-tugging moments, deeper romance, and a broader look at the world Ever King has created.I’m so glad I stuck with this series, and I’m already looking forward to what comes next!
7793875699	4.5 stars from me. I read this as an eARC, thank you Netgalley and the author Ever King and I'm voluntarily reviewing this book. This book picks up after the last one ends and seamlessly segues into following Bastian and Lyla’s story as the main focus. I have to say right from the start I adore these two characters, the banter, the tension, the desire, strength, foibles and determination of them both - chefs kiss perfect! The story continues on with the Starmarked Warriors and the Ravens both searching for answers. I love the development of the characters as they grow into their roles in this book. The world building also continues with new information being discovered and easily blended into the ongoing story. The political tensions of the House families at court bubbles away, dividing loyalties within the Academy. And the addition of the witches and what they can do, their history and possible future is just tantalising with potential, I can't wait to find out more about them. Add into the mix discovering hidden magical artifacts, developing untapped and forbidden powers, secret locations around the Academy and outside the wards with little side quests for some of the characters, it all had me racing through the pages desperately needing to find answers. And now I am left bereft waiting for the next installment!
7607610406	Thank you to Ever King and their team for the ARC!!I loved how this book turned out! I liked the last book too, however, I felt it lacked in certain areas. This book however, feels like it made up for it. Whereas the last book I felt you could definitely see where some of the muse was taken from, I don't feel like the same is for this book. It very much feels like it has truly grown into its own story and I can't wait to see where it goes from here! <3I loved the characters and how it focuses on a different couple while still following the same story. I don't think I have ever read a series like that but I think it works really well here. Lyla and Bastian complimented each other so well and I really liked seeing how they navigated their situation. Although we are following the story from a new perspective(s) in this book, I never felt lost or like I was missing anything by not being in Kiara or Lucians POV anymore which I was a little nervous about. I think it flowed very naturally. The only little thing is I felt we could have done a tad more plot wise in this book. The story itself was focused a lot on the main couple and I felt like I would have liked to see more of the plot moving along. We still did get to see things happen, just not *as* much as I personally like in my books. Overall, this book was an extremely fun read and would definitely recommend to those who love fantasy and romance books! I cannot wait to read the next book in the series!<3

BUT, Ever King has managed it.I’m also kind of mind blown how seamlessly the story continues in this series even with each book focusing on a different couple. I’m impressed.Onto the book itself. This couple is freaking amazing. I love them with my whole soul. I have a hardcore girl crush on Lyla. & Bastain is just that bad boy that you can fix. Drool. With Bastain collared to his own demons and Lyla being starmarked, will they ever be able to be together?Will Bastain be able to be freed so that he isn’t working for the king? & if he is, will his friends understand and forgive him? Will Lyla learn to embrace her magic? To learn how to strengthen it and find out what she can accomplish? & if so, will the girls be able to find all the answers they’re looking for? And ultimately, will the king always be one step ahead of them in this war?
7699784177	This book continued on from Academy of Villains but with a new couple, Lyla and Bastian.Lyla is beautiful, soft, a Forestmage who lives in the greenhouse and enjoys her time with the plants more than most people. Bastian is the king's servant, and he's being forced to do the king's commands no matter how dark. They are opposites but as they are thrown together, they find themselves coming to appreciate each other more and more. I really liked these two, their romance was sweet and a little swoony. I appreciated Lyla's growth as a mage and her learning more about the kingdom, the witches (enemies of mages), the subplot around the Starmarked warriors.In a world where the king is corrupt, and heartstrings are recently returned, there's political unrest, a little less focus on the magical academy itself but we get more of the Ravens, the secret society sworn to protect the royal family. The Ravens are developing plans to try and save the kingdom but mostly, the focus is on Bastian and Lyla and their budding romance, and Bastian's turmoil about doing the king's evil bidding.This book was really enjoyable, it was a bingeable read and I love the Greek mythology connections. I'll be looking forward to book 3!
7875329860	4.5 ⭐️Wow 🤩 Ok I thought book 1 was good but this one was great! The yearning and tension in this one was so delicious. I normally like the feisty and fierce FMCs but there was just something about Lyla and her soft steadfastness that appealed so strongly to me. I think it’s because even though she’s all ribbons and butterflies and soft colors she still has a will of steel and refuses to be a pushover. She certainly never let Bastian get away with much. And speaking of Bastian. Sweet, tortured Bastian. He was the perfect foil to Lyla and I loved their relationship arc so much. I’m a sucker for the “soft only for her” trope and fall for it every time. 𝘏𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘪𝘴𝘰𝘯 𝘪𝘯 𝘮𝘺 𝘷𝘦𝘪𝘯𝘴, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐 𝘴𝘢𝘷𝘰𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺 𝘥𝘳𝘰𝘱.The overarching plot moved along perfectly in this book. We left the academy walls behind at times and seeing the greater world and exactly how it’s being ravaged gave us even more world building. Getting more insight into the secret societies and its members kept things lively and the story moving at a snappy pace. The more this story unfolds the more invested I am and now I’m desperate for book 3. What you get:- magic academy- fated mates- yearning + tension - secret societies- girl power- found family- a little more spice - secrets + lies
7662220675	The second book in this magical, myth-inspired series follows Lyla Stark, a strong and quietly powerful FMC, and Bastian Lightcroft, a morally gray member of the Raven Society who carries a deadly secret. Their story blends enemies to lovers tension, touch-her-and-die protectiveness, and a dangerous game of trust and betrayal.Lyla, the Oracle’s chosen guardian of the Golden Tree and its Apples, lives in the Greenhouse, navigating the unwanted attention of classmates. Bastian, is being used by Kore, working for Moros, to spy—or die. His loyalties are torn between duty, desperation, and an irresistible connection to Lyla.As the two are forced together by fate and the Oracle’s mission, they uncover dark secrets, unsolved mysteries, memories that had been lost, and the thin line between hero and villain—because sometimes, the villain gets the girl. With rich Greek mythology undertones, elemental magic, and a fierce sense of found family among the Raven Society, this book is layered, emotional, and impossible to put down.We also get more glimpses of Kiara, Prince Lucian, and the other members of the Raven Society and I’m already desperate for the next book in this amazing series.

Getting really invested now in the story! I love how everything flows, the author did a really good job at linking everything together. There is a lot of information but its all relevant to the story and if you look deep you can stop little easter eggs of past/future events. Again i loooove the magic system, the whole personalized grimoires are such a cool thing! i would LOVE to see some art of each MC's grimoires. Ever King has truly got me on the edge of my seat wanting to know more about all these side characters! I'm so invested in all of them i struggle to decide who i want to know about next!Bring on Book 3!!!
8098382763	** spoiler alert ** THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SPICY.Dare I say I enjoyed this story more than the first one? The yearning between Bastian and Lyla just screamed at my soul. The troubled dark soul got redemption and his fated bond after fighting it so hard, I’m in literal heaven. To protect them and kill for your loved one. I am still a bit mad that he didn’t disclose much to essentially his brothers, not to air out EVERYTHING as he did for Lyla, but why wouldn’t they understand it when they’ve technically been in similar shoes? He just got the “lucky” pick of being the one with powers that people wanted to exploit. Maybe I’m just being too naive to it but hey, thoughts are thoughts.Also don’t get me started on how excited I was to see that witches made an appearance! Definitely had a feeling.. 👀 Reading about Kiara harnessing her power better and this trio of girls just moving like the bosses that they are. Gates? I open em in my sleep. This trio truly made me so happy to witness their friendship flourish. I think there should be more or that in stories, not just a love interest/mates but THESE type of bonds forming between people. Truly such a sweet read to have. Love is the binding for everything.
7837737468	Book 2 in this series was even better 😍 I loved Lyla and Bastian’s story. And the Adonis and Aphrodite retelling. I love that Bastian STAYS as a morally grey MMC. It always bothers me how morally grey MMCs start off as morally grey but really they’re just a big softy. Bastian is not and that’s why I love him. The plot thickens in book 2 with the King/Moros control over Ithaka as well as secrets being revealed which makes it so much more exciting! And the dynamic between Lucien and Kiara and how everything that’s happening impacts them. Like it all came across so beautifully. I love how this is Greek mythology yet almost Hogwarts at the same time. I love the Raven society boys…it feels like hanging out with the Slytherins 🐍 It’s dark academia meets romantasy and honestly I love it so much. Plus the sisterhood between Kiara, Lyla, and Octavia was so heart-warming. It was so well done. I am SUPER excited for Dorian and Bellatrix’s story! The way Dorian is around/about her in just those small glimpses…😍 already obsessed. I highly recommend this series! Perfect for autumn vibes especially 🍂
7363537658	I absolutely LOVED Lessons in Loyalty by Ever King. This is the second book in the Academy of Villains series and it did not disappoint. This book picks up right where book 1 leaves off. It's a fast paced romantasy with Greek mythology twisted in and follows the characters Lyla and Bastian's (Adonis and Aphrodite). It's filled with strong loveable main and side characters, excitement, political intrigue, danger, magic and this book has some added spice thrown in which I was all for.••”𝘐 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘤𝘢𝘯’𝘵 𝘣𝘦 𝘵𝘰𝘶𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥.

7574605461	I liked this more than the first book in the series. I enjoyed the push and pull between the softness of Lyla and the darkness of Bastian. Many novels in this genre have two headstrong, aggressive, feisty lovers clashing together, but this felt more balanced. Lyla and Bastian complemented each other well, and the build up to the big reveal of Bastian’s secret made for a great read. Kore was an excellent villain, and I loved having even more references to mythology with the names of the rivers and the golden apples. Having a few chapters with other perspectives was also excellent, we need to keep learning more from Kiara and Lucien’s perspectives. Learning more about the witches was very much appreciated, and this second book felt far less like an introduction to the world and magic system, and far more like an intense unravelling of secrets and mysteries. I think I have figured out a major series plot line, and I’m very excited to find out if I am correct (it seemed really obvious so I’m assuming everyone else has figured it out as well even if the characters themselves are keeping way too many secrets from each other). Can’t wait for the next one!
7687340643	** spoiler alert ** OMG—the magic continues in this book & I was absolutely blown away!! It was SO fascinating learning about Bastian’s spiritmage powers & Lyla’s forestmage abilities. I adore these two—their grumpy x sunshine dynamic was slow-burn perfection! 🔥We’re diving deeper into Ithaka’s secrets & I am so here for the DRAMA. The literal gasps I let out while reading were real—uncovering some of kingdom’s history was wild. 🫠I definitely missed my OGs, Lucian & Kiara, so their POVs were everything. I also loved seeing more of Dorian, Tobias & Octavia! It’s such a great setup for book 3 & I’m dying to know which couple we’ll follow next. One of my favorite things about this series is how each book features a new couple, but the story continues seamlessly. It’s honestly unfair how lovable each character is. Like… how am I supposed to pick a favorite!? 🥲Also—the girl power?! Fierce, soft & everything in between. It reminded me that strength looks different on everyone. And OMG, the barklings! These adorable little creatures help Lyla in her greenhouse & gave total baby Groot vibes. I want one SO BAD! 🌱

Enjoying the developing storyline’s of each character. Can’t wait for the next book to be released. Thank you Netgalley & the publisher for the copy. This is my voluntary review
7939578306	This was so good!!!! I think I liked this one better than book 1, and that's saying a lot because I really enjoyed book 1! I had such a great time reading this.Let's start with the story. We got some juicy new secrets revealed in this book about the world and everything the characters THINK they know about it. I loved the expansion of the storyline in this, the stakes are definitely getting higher and this book definitely had some OMG moments that I didn't see coming! Now let's talk about the characters. I am OBSESSED with Bastian and Lyla. I love them. I really enjoyed their dynamic, how they challenged each other in different ways, and the tension and banter were CHEF'S KISS. I also enjoyed that we got a little bit more from Kiara and Lucian, because I admittedly missed them, and we also are starting to see more about some of the other characters that no doubt will be the main characters in future books! Overall, this was so much fun to read and I highly recommend it! I am so excited to continue this series, I am just sad that I have to wait now for the next book!!!
7236117590	** spoiler alert ** I was very lucky to read Academy of Villains last year and really enjoyed so was very lucky to receive an early e-ARC of Lessons in Loyalty. The writing is really good and the prose flows very naturally, as per her earlier books the dark academia vibes and the setting was executed really well with both characters being really fleshed out. I felt that Lyla was a really good representation of a soft female character while still having a strong personality while Bastian was really good character with conflicting morals. I do wish his character was explored more especially with him playing both sides and having a 'betrayal' aspect to him as well as his backstory being more elaborated I would've liked to know more about his brother who was mentioned several times but the storyline never went further despite seeming important. One thing that I think wasn't necessary is the random insertion of Lucien's perspective mid book I understand it was to get a more rounded view of what was happening but I think to only have one chapter in his POV felt kinda unnecessary and just a bit of a cop out to not explaining it well in the other chapters. It would've been more meaningful to have it as the last or first chapter similar to Kiara's first chapter. Anyway all in all a really fun book and I will be reading the third !!
7644453316	this book is definitely unique as it has a unique writing style in it. as an overall summary i enjoyed this book much more than book 1, i just felt there was more chemistry between the characters. however this book is very unique in the fact that it switches main POV's in the second book, similar to interconnected standalone romances however this is where the similarities end as the standalone romances start and end a plot within the book while this plot was carried over. i did struggle at times with this book because it was clear Kiara and Lucien were the main characters and the story revolves around them while this book touched less on that and more on Bastian and lyla. while this book was enjoyable i would have rather it been a spinoff rather than a continuation, with the main books in Kiara/lucian POV's with either a new book from this book happening after the events or simultaneously.
7850404745	🌟 ARC Review: Academy of Villains: Lesson in Loyalty by Ever King 🌟 What a ride! Ever King has delivered an emotionally charged, action-packed story full of morally grey characters, complicated loyalties, and heartbreak that hits deep. Lesson in Loyalty pulled me into a world where villains aren’t just evil—they’re broken, bold, and begging to be understood. The tension between trust and betrayal kept me on edge the entire time. I found myself rooting for characters I knew I shouldn’t, and questioning every alliance. The emotional stakes were high, and when the plot twists hit—they hurt. There’s something raw and real in the way Ever King writes pain, love, and loyalty, and it stayed with me long after the final chapter. If you love dark academia vibes, found family twisted by secrets, and characters who are loyal to a fault—this book will wreck you in the best way. I already need the next one. ✨ Thank you Ever King for the ARC—my villain era has officially begun
7394328246	This one was honestly such a joy to read! It managed to mix darkness with the most adorable romantic moments ever and I LOVE the main couple! 💗☺️It has little touches of Greek mythology which really added to the worldbuilding for me - I loved seeing if I had spotted everything! I cannot wait for the next book, they are all intertwined so we are catching glimpses of the other couples’s love stories through this one (which I have never seen done so well!)🥰Violence Rating: Level 3 - ⚔️⚔️⚔️ - it’s dark but that is more the aesthetic than gore and graphic violence on page! Romance Rating: 🛡️🛡️🛡️🛡️🛡️🛡️I’m not sure what to rate this - it is more explicit than I usually read! We have a couple of open door scenes that last for multiple pages - I would say a Swoony C but the upper end! If you know me you know that I usually read no-spice but this I would say does brush into the spicy side. It all depends on what you are looking for 💗Damsel Reader Recomendation: Upper YA/NA
