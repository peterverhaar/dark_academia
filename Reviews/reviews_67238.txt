4967989803	What is wrong with the author.Watch the movie. This book shouldn't exist.The author wrote it after the movie and decided to add a pointless SA scene and some other questionable things... it's just nowhere near as good so don't waste your time.*It made it to my worst books of 2022: https://youtu.be/yaBImu6ejEM
4192033156	take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
3472105798	** spoiler alert ** I went to the woods because I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life! To put to rout all that was not life. And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. “Carpe Diem,”... “Seize the day. Make your lives extraordinary.”I watched Deat Poets Society movie a few years ago and I still sometimes watch its clips. It’s one of my all-time favorite movies. A week ago I was scrolling through my Goodreads feeds and found this book and I screamed like WHAT??? THIS BOOK DO EXIST?!! Boy, my emotions at that moment!!!This book isn’t only about poetry, it’s about life, dreams, love, everything. It’s a silver line in the clouds of despair and helplessness we feel. Parents think that they are doing the best with their children but often they don’t. While dreaming big for the children, they don’t pause for a moment to ask them, “what do you want?”, “are you happy” or “what makes you happy?.” The pressure they put on children often leads to what happened at the end of this book. I think every other person who reads or watch Dead Poets Society will feel this connection with the characters because we all have been through what Neil, Todd and the others were feeling. Since I knew what was going to happen, I just couldn’t stop my tears as I was reading Neil getting excited about acting, doing his best to get the part and dancing with joy when he got it. He was so full of life. He brought back the Dead Poet Society, he made his friends do what they love, he was there for Todd, he was just the perfect human being!. And when he took his life, it was like he took a piece of my heart with him. As Todd said, “Neil wouldn’t kill himself! He loved living!” Damn it, he loved living!And Todd, Todd is so precious. His poems, his love, his loneliness, you can’t help but love him and want to comfort him. I love how he stands for the Captain at the end and told his parents off. Charlie, my Nuwanda boy! I love him. And I love Knox. Meeks, Pitts, all of them. My dead poets!!! And how can I forget about John Keating! “O Captain! My Captain!”. Keating is like The Person we all need to meet at least once in our life time and it’s our misfortune that rarely we meet people like him.Here are some of Keating’s quotes:“I say—drivel! One reads poetry because he is a member of the human race, and the human race is filled with passion! Medicine, law, banking—these are necessary to sustain life. But poetry, romance, love, beauty? These are what we stay alive for!“That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.” …”What will your verse be?”“And don’t limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared—anything with the stuff of revelation in it. It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary. By all means, write about the sky or a girl’s smile, but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day. I don’t care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and—if it’s inspired—makes us feel a bit immortal.”“Lads, there is a great need in all of us to be accepted, but you must trust what is unique or different about yourself, even if it is odd or unpopular.”I can talk and talk about this book. This will ever be in my heart.
3891791525	lacked the homoerotic subtext of the movie, absolutely pointless

5904661223	★ 2 stars “The boys had seized the cave, and in it they’d found a home away from Welton, away from parents, teachers, and friends—a place where they could be people they never dreamed they’d be. The Dead Poets Society was alive and thriving and ready to seize the day.” i first watched Dead Poets Society when i was 12 years old and i fell in love with it right away. guess you could say it was love at first sight, because it was. it’s a beautiful, enthralling, memorable and impactful film. it profoundly affected and captivated me, and touched my soul in so many ways — watching it was truly a life changing experience for me. it’s one of my all time favorites for a reason. so you must be wondering why i’m giving this novelization such a low rating. well, i’m gonna go straight to the point: it didn’t properly capture the essence of the film. i dare say it failed quite miserably. see, i’m not a person who reads novelizations of screenplays — in fact, this is the first one i read, so for that reason i was expecting something different. i thought “oh okay, it’s a book based on the movie, which means it will be as good as the movie, right?” as you can notice, i was wrong. very wrong. this book is unnecessarily rushed, not very well written and weak — no other way to put it. it didn’t match the greatness of the movie at all; not even close. there’s no depth whatsoever, the characters whom i deeply love felt one-dimensional here, we have a few unnecessary additions/changes and, dear lord, the writing was awful for most of the time. just to clarify, i wasn’t expecting this to be better than the movie, i honestly didn’t even think that it was possible anyway. but i also wasn’t expecting this to be so bland and extremely disappointing. come on, the potential was there, and yet the author managed to waste it. such a shame. i’m giving this two stars because it’s a short book and that’s exactly what i needed to help with my reading slump so at least there’s a positive thing. also, the first few pages weren’t so bad and i foolishly believed it was going to be a good book that would become a new favorite of mine (laughable, isn’t it?) but then you know what happened... it went downhill. for my own sanity, i’m going to pretend this book doesn’t exist and i’m going to rewatch the film so i can wipe this from my mind completely. if you never watched Dead Poets Society, don’t make the mistake of reading this book first (or perhaps don’t make the mistake of reading this book at all). go watch the film, i guarantee it’s a million times better and more magical. and i promise you won’t regret of watching this literal masterpiece. “O Captain! My Captain!” ︵‿︵‿︵‿ ꒰💌꒱ ‿︵‿︵‿︵ ᰔ quotes: “No matter what anyone tells you, words and ideas have the power to change the world.”“Carpe Diem. Seize the day. Make your lives extraordinary.”“One reads poetry because he is a member of the human race, and the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, banking—these are necessary to sustain life. But poetry, romance, love, beauty? These are what we stay alive for.”“And don’t limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared—anything with the stuff of revelation in it. It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary.”“When you read, don’t consider only what the author thinks, but take time to consider what you think.”“You must strive to find your own voice, boys, and the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all.”“I feel like I’ve never been alive. For years, I’ve been risking nothing. I have no idea what I am or what I want to do.”“And acting!” Neil bubbled. “It’s got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they’re lucky, live about half an exciting life. If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of great lives!” ─────────────────────➷ pre-review:i just need something short to help with my mini reading slump and i feel like this might help! not only because it’s a short book, but also because Dead Poets Society is one of my favorite movies of all time so i think i’ll enjoy the book. 🥹🤎please ignore the fact that i’m now reading four books at the same time.
2939829751	دو تا مقاله در نقد و ردّ دیدگاه این فیلم/کتاب خوندم که بین دو دیدگاه تعادل برقرار بشه. بازم لازمه مطالب بیشتری بخونم، ولی فعلاً مهم‌ترین چیزی که دستگیرم شد اینه:بزرگ‌ترین نقد وارد به روش آموزشی کیتینگ، اینه که بچه‌ها و احساسات بچه‌ها رو خام بار می‌آورد. البته لازم و ضروریه که بچه‌ها با نگاه متفاوت به جهان نگاه کنن، همون قدر به احساس بها بدن که به «افتخار و شرافت» و باقی شعارهای مدرسه بها می‌دادن، و لازم و ضروریه که بچه‌ها راه خودشون رو کشف کنن و بسازن، اما روش تربیتی کیتینگ در همین جا متوقف می‌شه. فقط به بچه‌ها می‌گه راه خودتون رو برید، فقط به بچه‌ها میگه شعر و جهان رو با احساسی سرشار بخونید و زندگی کنید، اما دیگه تلاشی برای تربیت این احساسات سرشار نمی‌کنه. و احساسات تربیت نشده، همیشه خامه. احساسات بدون تفکر انتقادی، همیشه در سطحی‌ترین حالت باقی می‌مونه. نظریات و تئوری‌های مختلف بهمون یاد میدن هنگام خوندن شعر یا جهان، احساس‌های جدیدی رو تجربه کنیم که قبلاً فکر نمی‌کردیم وجود دارن، و خودمون، جهانمون و شعر رو از نظرگاه‌های مختلف ببینیم و بشناسیم که قبلاً بهشون توجه نداشتیم. و در تمام این‌ها تفکر انتقادی هم لازمه تا اسیر یک دیدگاه نشیم و قادر باشیم فراتر از حیطهٔ احساس و دیدگاه فعلی‌مون رو هم ببینیم.اما در روش آموزشی کیتینگ، نظریات مختلف و تفکر انتقادی، فقط با برچسب آکادمیک بودن، کنار گذاشته می‌شن و در عمل چیزی که باقی می‌مونه، احساسات‌گرایی خام و پرورش نیافته است، احساسات‌گرایی خامی که باعث میشه خیلی از شاعرها از برنامهٔ درسی کیتینگ کنار گذاشته بشن و فقط رمانتیک‌ها باقی بمونن، احساسات‌گرایی خامی که باعث می‌شه نهایت لذتی که بچه‌ها از خوندن شکسپیر سر کلاس می‌برن، به خاطر تقلید صدای کیتینگ باشه، احساسات‌گرایی خامی که باعث می‌شه یک دانش‌آموز مستعد در اولین مواجهه با ناکامی خودکشی کنه.

92976904	I started to read this book -- and couldn't get past the first chapter -- unfortunately, like other, books written after the movie was made, it falls short of literary sparkle. I love the movie though, and for me it will always be a reminder. My husband, son, and daughter were in a stage version of this play -- for opening night. My husband died that night. This is a poem I wrote about the juxtaposition of the two: In Fifty-five Words Father and son, Playing father and son: On stage, the dialogue Between the character Neil and his father was electric; Excellent casting decision. It was just like watching themAt home.Teenage angst, Overbearing father-- In a way, Disturbing. In the end, on stage, the son committed suicide. At home, that night, My husband Died. PS: It is now nine years later, and while in many ways it has gotten easier, the two will be forever entwined. In remembrance, every year on the anniversary of Kelly's death, I watch Dead Poets Society; it feel fitting somehow.
6763162163	This is a book I have been wanting to read for some time now and my initial reaction when I set my eyes upon it was how very small it is. At just over 150 pages I don’t know how they managed to cram what is a 2 hour movie into such a small book. Furthermore, an interesting thought regarding this book is that the book was written based on the film rather than the film on the book; I thought this was most unusual but was ready to give it a read. I have seen so many negative 1 🌟 reviews about this book and in all honesty I can’t understand why. Maybe reading the book before watching the movie was a good call, idk but I enjoyed it. I found some of the poetry written by Knox in the latter half of the book really sweet and moving 🥹🥲I think this is one of those books that the rating is based more on the way the book makes you FEEL rather than the plot itself. The book begins with a new school year and from the very beginning the boys are addressed : Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? Tradition! Honor! Discipline! Excellence! Was shouted in unison by the boys - these four pillars will become the cornerstones to your lives here at the best preparatory school in the United States. They very quickly meet and become inspired by their teacher Mr. Keating who teaches them many life lessons including: ‘“Carpe Diem” - Seize the day. Make your lives extraordinary.’“We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for,”“We are dreaming of a new day when the new day’s here already.”However, the boys simultaneously become interested in ‘The Dead Poet’s Society’ which Mr. Keating was a former member of. They get rather caught up with it and before long are completely preoccupied by this secret club. This made for the perfect read for a gloomy late August day…slowly preparing myself for an Autumn of dark academia reads 📚 The last few chapter totally caught me off guard and SHOCKED me to my core. Nj I was almost in tears with how moving it was. It’s those small subtle touches that just get me 🥺 Now that I have read the book, I will, of course, go and watch the film to compare. UPDATE: I have watched the film and I MUCH prefer the book no matter what all the other reviews say. I did like the film but I felt more of a connection through the book 📖 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
274368231	I can't remember ever rating a book at one star. Oh, yes I do. Wuthering Heights. And I HATE that book.Okay. I love this film. Loved it in the late 80s and I love it still. The movie is not based on the book; the book is based on the movie. It's not great. It's little more than a copy of the screen play. (Which probably would have been a better read.) The writing was poor. Drab. Telling. The author quoted the school dog. "Gggrrr." I'm not kidding. There were some small liberties taken, as I assume there would need to be for legal purposes. And while they were still poorly written, at least those scenes did not have quite the same feel as having to sit and listen to my mother tell me about a great movie she saw in real-movie time. The rest of the novel did.The plus? Takes less time to read than watching the movie. So I guess if you're pressed for time ... nah. Just watch the movie. It's a bazillion times better. And then you get to watch young, cute, tortured Sean Robert Leonard for 2 hours. It's a win-win.(Now how to be diplomatic about this next week at my first-ever attending of a book club I've joined, for which I read this "novel." I may have to keep on the quiet side.)

4758217049	I don't know how long it will take me to recover from this book and story and, genuinely speaking, I don't think I'll ever recover from it anyway.Definitely feeling completely drained emotionally speaking and also extremely unwell.(Still have to watch the movie, possibly today, to break me even more.)Needless to say, this story definitely shaped me and left a profound impact on my psyche and understanding of the world.Adding this to my "favourites" shelf.P.S. Yes, I love tragic books and yes, I love having my heart ripped out of my chest and torn into tiniest pieces, as well as my soul aching in despair and frustration for the character. Since I'm a quite logically driven person and not really emotional overall in life, I like it when books have a certain effect on me because it's rare that something "shakes me awake". It's hard to make me sob because I try to over rationalise characters, their mindsets, lifestyles as well as their (in my opinion overly silly and unrealistic) actions, which often solely leads to annoyance or indifference related to the story, so I'm just glad when I can actually cry because of a book and "it hits a nerve".That story was definitely "IT" for me!! I feel weird saying this buttt I managed to finally cry after something that felt like an eternity of books that left me feeling empty (not in the sense of emotionally spent buttt in the sense of leaving ZERO impact on an emotional, psychological and philosophical level).

I love these boys so much. The writing itself wasn’t the best but it was fine and easy to follow. I do like how the author added the movie’s deleted scene and also added some of her own scenes. I also really really loved how we got more of Todd’s characters and his relationship with his parents. We don’t get much of that in the movie. However, she did cut out the “I was good… I was really good” part which kinda made me sad bc that part HITS :( Idrk if I can review the story itself bc she didn’t come up with it but I love it so much obviously.

This story is a best learning for student-wants-to-be-teacher in the future (yeah..just like me) because lots of things mentioned in this story should be realized by us...all of us.
3180094244	Una inspiradora y emotiva novela, en que asistimos a un fragmento de la vida de sus personajes; solo un momento que, probablemente, marcará el resto de sus vidas, para bien o para mal.Es casi nada lo que se profundiza en la figura del Sr. Keating y como logró “sobrevivir” a su propia educación en Walton. La autora se centra en lo que quiere contar y cumple sobradamente su objetivo: una conmovedora evocación a vencer los obstáculos, abandonar el conformismo y seguir el difícil camino de nuestros sueños.Sin embargo, mirándolo en retrospectiva, tampoco libero de toda responsabilidad al propio John Keating de los sucesos que desencadenan el desenlace, pero en el sentido de que no fue capaz de prever cómo sus enseñanzas ahondarían la desesperanza en jóvenes que aún no tenían todas las herramientas para enfrentar la vida, sobre todo en una época marcada por los prejuicios.Por último y a pesar de que no he visto la película todavía, es imposible dejar de imaginar a Robin Williams en el papel del Sr. Keating.

3670853586	Ok so I don't regularly write actual reviews but the DPS movie is very important to me, so I actually wanted to sit down and talk about this book properly. I hated it. I started this book months ago around late November and I read about half of it until I really didn't feel like picking it back up. It was a mix of the book not being very good and my hyperfixation being over. DPS has recently become quite popular on tiktok which caused me to hyperfixate on it once more, even though I never enjoyed it, I had been meaning to finish the book just for the sake of finishing it, so I used this opportunity to finish it today. In case you don't know, this book is based on the movie, and it was published 9 years after the movie was released. This movie didn't need to be a book. Perhaps it could've been a good book, if it had been written from Neil's or Todd's perspective, or if it had actually gone into depth about the movie's themes. Instead of doing any of those things, this book is simply the movie and its deleted scenes adapted into a book format. Movies tend to be fast-paced considering they usually only last around two hours, because of this they usually don't get to go in depth and detail about things in the same way a book can. This is where the problem comes in if you're going to adapt a movie into a book and not add anything, you end up with a book that comes off as rushed and shallow. Not only was barely anything added but some things were cut even. The scene where Neil and Todd chuck the desk set is a beautiful scene and one of my favorites, but in the book, it's cut short for no apparent reason. I'll give them points for giving Charlie's character a bit more depth and a character arc. They also made Meeks and Pitts slightly more prominent than in the movies which was appreciated. These were nice touches but any points it may have earned the book are taken away by the fact that they stripped Knox down to only a chris-obsessed man. I don't condone of Knox's actions in the movie as is but in the book, there is not one moment where he speaks of something without it being related to Chris and how much he "loves" her. He comes off as overtly creepy in his infatuation and (spoiler alert perhaps) downright sexually assaults her during Chet's party. Additionally, the characters at times did things that I found to be out of character, but I won't make a big point about it considering that's a pretty subjective topic. I don't think its ever necessary to adapt a screenplay into a book, it's a difficult and unnecessary task considering the story was written with the purpose of being displayed on the silver screen. Regardless, it could've potentially been good, but it was executed very poorly.P.S.I’ve read the original screenplay and if you’re looking to read the movie that’s a much better choice.

2080261294	می دونین من همیشه کتاب هایی با تم مدرسه ای رو خیلی دوست داشتم. شاید عمده ی دلیلش این بوده باشه که اونقدری که باید و شاید از دوران خوش مدرسه لذت نبردم. اینکه شاگرد نمونه بودن رو به شاگرد بی انضباط بودن ترجیح می دادم اما ته دلم همیشه جسارت اون دسته از دوستانم رو که به خاطر شیطنت ها و بازیگوشی هاشون تو دردسر می افتادن، تحسین می کردم. این کتاب برای من یادآور همون دوران از دست رفته بودبیشتر شخصیت های این کتاب رو دست داشتم. از"تاد" و تمام اون خجالت کشیدن ها و آرزوهاش برای درک و دیده شدن گرفته تا "نیل" ، پسر جسور و دوست داشتنی داستان که به واسطه ی پدر سختگیرش آرزوهای بر باد رفته ی زیادی داشت و همین طور "چارلی" ، پسر جذاب و دلربای قصه که دل در گروی عشق دختران زیبارو داشت، اما در زمان های لازم با بی عدالتی ها می جنگید و هیچ وقت پشت دوستانش رو خالی نمی کرد. در کنار همه ی اونا معلمشون " کیتینگ" و تمام تلاشش برای آموختن معنای واقعی زندگی به این بچه ها واقعا دوست داشتنی و بی نظیر بودیه چیز خیلی جالبی که من تو این کتاب دوست داشتم این بود که نویسنده زیاد وارد عمق شخصیت های داستانش نمی شد، به جای اون به نکته های ظریفی درباره ی اونا اشاره می کرد و بعد ذهن خواننده هاش رو رها می کرد تا هر جور که دوست دارن شخصیت ها رو برای خودشون مجسم کننبا این حال کتاب واقعا پایان غافلگیر کننده ای داشت. به تصور من نویسنده یک مقدار زیادی عجولانه کتاب رو به اتمام رسوند در حالی که هنوز خیلی جا برای رسیدن به یک همچین پایانی داشت در آخر بگم که من فرمت پی دی اف کتاب رو خوندم که اصلا و ابدا به هیچ کس توصیه نمی کنم. سانسورهای زیاد، غلطهای املایی و جملاتی که سر و تهشون معلوم نبود همه از جمله دلایلی بودن که باعث شدن نتونم اونجوری که دلم می خواست از کتاب لذت ببرم

4189295744	“¡Oh, Capitán! ¡Mi Capitán!” es el mensaje con que alzan la voz un grupo de alumnos erguidos encima de sus pupitres para homenajear al hombre que les devolvió el olvidado espíritu de lucha por ser ellos mismos. Pero me estoy adelantando porque este es el final de la novela y para glorificarla uno debe conocer su principio.Tradición, honor, disciplina y excelencia son los pilares del colegio Welton en el que estudian nuestros protagonistas, jóvenes sobre cuyos hombros recae el abrumador y hostil peso de las ambiciones de sus padres y el rigor de sus educadores. Un entorno que prioriza el deber, la responsabilidad y los alienta a convertirse en individuos funcionales de un sistema que se enorgullece en estar desprovisto de individualidad, vigor y sueños.La llegada de un profesor de literatura les provee a estos jóvenes el descubrimiento de la filosofía “Carpe Diem”. Se hallan, por primera vez, ante un adulto que lejos de moldearlos para encajar en las filas de Harvard o un despacho legal los alienta a vivir el momento, a profundizar en la vida y su sentido, a desvelar la belleza que se esconde en el verso y al verso que desvela la belleza que pasa inadvertida al ojo desolado e indiferente. Keating los alienta a ahondar dentro de sus espíritus para hallar qué los motiva y a luchar por defender su individualidad y el valor de ésta en un mundo que pisotea fervientemente el ardor creativo en post de la eficiencia mecánica.La novela es avasalladora por el homenaje que rinde a la poesía y a los poetas, por la oda que irgue a la juventud, a los sueños y más que nada a la libertad de soñarlos. Posee un ritmo ágil, vivo, que hace al lector partícipe de las reuniones y compañero en su despertar después de una larga letanía del deber ser. Pocas veces una lectura me atravesó tan certeramente y me llamó tanto a querer ser más sin ser ese más otra cosa que una versión auténtica de mí misma. Y pocas novelas, también, consiguieron conmoverme de forma tan estremecedora con un desenlace trágico que intensifica su búsqueda de sentidos.

7789570788	4 ستاره⭐⭐⭐⭐ به کتاب انجمن شاعران مرده این کتاب بیشتر تجربه بود. از اون داستان‌هاست که انگار به جای اینکه فقط بخونی، می‌ذاره یه گوشه‌ای از وجودت نفس بکشه.ماجرای چندتا پسر دبیرستانی توی یه مدرسه خیلی سخت‌گیر و سنتیه. همه‌چی اونجا با قانون و فشار خانواده‌ها پیش می‌ره، تا اینکه یه معلم متفاوت، آقای کیتینگ، وارد می‌شه. همون اول کاری می‌فهمی این آدم از اون معلم‌های معمولی نیست.برای من جذاب‌ترین بخش داستان این بود که هر کدوم از بچه‌ها وقتی با کیتینگ آشنا شدن، یه جرقه توی وجودشون روشن شد. یکی جرات کرد عشقش رو دنبال کنه، یکی جرات کرد بره سمت تئاتر، یکی جرات پیدا کرد به قوانین خشک پشت کنه. ولی خب... هر جرقه‌ای هم بهایی داره.کتاب پر از جمله‌هایی بود که آدم دلش می‌خواست هایلایت کنه و بچسبونه به دیوار اتاقش. همش می‌گفت: لحظه رو دریاب! (همون carpe diem معروف)و واقعاً آدم رو می‌ذاره جلوی این سوال: من دارم زندگیمو زندگی می‌کنم، یا فقط دارم روزا رو رد می‌کنم؟اما خب، داستان بی‌رحم هم هست. پایانش اونجوری نیست که همه چی گل و بلبل باشه. یه تلخی داره، یه سیلی‌ حسابی بهت می زنه😭👌🏽وایب خود کتاب و فضاش رو واقعا دوست داشتم، هنوز وقت نکردم فیلمش ببینم ولی قطعا می بینم.این کتاب از اون دسته کتابهایی بود که داشتم موازی خوانیش می کردم. با حجم کمی که داره ولی خیلی دل نشینه🥹خلاصه که من با خوندنش خیلی کیف کردم، هرچند که پایانش حالت رو می گیره ولی چیزی از قشنگیش کم نمی کنه.

2581634473	3 / 5 A meaningful book and classic (though I think this was written based off the movie?); it’s a story that everyone should read/watch. That being said, even though I enjoyed this, I was left a little disappointed and wanting more.While I didn’t see that ending with Neil (but I completely understand why it went that way), I wish the rest of the characters could have been more developed and less dramatic. This entire short novel felt too theatrical and only a few characters seemed to have their own personalities. The rest morphed together — and for me, characters are (almost) always the most important aspect of the story.I especially didn’t care for Knox and Chris. Quite honestly I thought their so-called relationship was one of the most unimaginable and dull romances I’ve read about. This could be because I didn’t like Knox, and Chris was two-dimensional and moronic (sorry, but not really).For a novel/movie that is so highly praised, I expected to feel moved (or at least more moved than I was). Regardless, I do think this is meaningful and important to book to read, because the message of following your dreams is an important one. But it’s one that could have been done better, with more development and craft.

4523800885	I want to preface this by saying that me disliking this book has no correlation with what I felt about the movie. The movie (which I watched before reading this) was absolutely spectacular, and containts extremely important messages about the meaning of life and the importance of how one chooses to spend it, as well as a celebration of bravery and the freedom of self expression. Please do watch the movie. Now onto what I absolutely hated about the book:The very existence of this book is a puzzlement to me.If you have watched the movie you don't need to read this, and if you haven't watched the movie I'd strongly advice you against reading the book since it would most likely make no sense and you would have a hard time actually connecting with the characters. The writing of the book. This is EXTREMELY fast paced and the writing does an awful job of making the reader connect to the characters as mentioned before. Further more, there are certain scenes like the one when Neil offers comfort to Todd during his birthday night, (a scene of up most importance that establishes really well the trust and connection between there two characters) that is cut off way shorter in the book for absolutely no reason. The sexual assault. So..... The writer apparently felt like cutting out the birthday conformation scene between Todd and Neil yet throught it was necessary to make one of the characters gr0pe a girl at a party. This doesn't happen in the movie, and it's never addressed later, letting the reader draw the conclusion that the only reason this was added was the authors misogyny. Speaking of misogyny....... There is another scene in this book that isn't in the movie during which professor Keating, the eccentric character encouraging the boys to find freedom of self expression and live life as freely, and passionately as possible, decides it would be a good idea to make the students in this all-boys school, take a pop quiz and while the students are trying to focus he is showing the class pornographic content to "prepare them for college and the distraction of girls". Another scene not in the movie. Another scene that has absolutely no reason existing other than the authors clear misogyny. Please skip this book. You can probably find better fan fiction on tumblr rather than whatever this is.

3984902945	Contemporary general fiction, written and set in my own lifetime, hasn't formed a large part of my reading over the decades; I've tended to be more drawn either to older classics or to "genre fiction." But I've appreciated much of what I have read in this vein, and recognize its value in a healthy and well-balanced literary diet. So I'm now trying to be more intentional in seeking it out more often; and since I was looking for a quick read late last month, and this particular book has only 166 pages, it struck me as a natural choice. It happens to be a novelization of the 1989 movie of the same name (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/ ); but since I've never seen the latter, I can't compare the two, and approached it strictly as a novel on its own terms. (As I've commented in other reviews, I've never subscribed to the snob clerisy dogma that movie novelizations are inherently trash.)Our setting here is fictional 100-year-old Welton Academy, an elite private combination junior high/high school for boys located in a small Vermont town, in the fall and early winter of 1959. Born in 1948, author Nancy Horowitz Kleinbaum (who, sadly, died last year), a professional writer who did a number of movie novelizations in her career, was 11 years old at that time; but it's not her own lived experience that underlies the story. That experience would actually be that of movie scriptwriter Tom Schulman, who won an Academy Award for the movie screenplay this novel is based on, and who in turn drew for material on his own memories of attending a similar prep school in Nashville; one of his teachers there inspired the character of charismatic, maverick new English instructor Mr. Keating. (Schulman, however, was actually slightly younger than Kleinbaum; I'm guessing that he pushed the chronological setting back to a few years before his own high school experience in order to avoid complicating the plot with late 60s issues.) Rather than focusing on a single protagonist, we follow the shared experiences of a small group of 11th-grade boys, who will soon (with Keating's tacit encouragement) revive the sub rosa Dead Poets Society that he belonged to in his own student days at Welton.For me, this book was a window into a milieu totally outside my own experience: the world of the monied WASP elite and their pricey hot-house private school seedbeds for Ivy League enrollees. It's not an attractive milieu (and not meant to be). All of these boys have parents willing to ship them off to a boarding school just because it purports to be a ticket to a prestigious college; none of the parent-child relationships we're shown are at all healthy, and none of these parents have imparted any particular moral or spiritual foundation to their offspring. Welton purports to base itself on the "four pillars" of "Tradition! Honor! Discipline! Excellence!" but "defines" them with empty cliches, and in practice doesn't inculcate any particular character qualities except conformity, self-protection, and obedience to power, backed up by a regime of corporal punishment that Dickens' Mr. Squeers might have applauded. What passes for academic rigor consists of dishing out copious amounts of reading homework (but not necessarily helping the students understand what they're reading). Parental and academic authority here consistently comes across as an uncaring, self-serving and in some cases sadistic caricature, that's drawn with unrealistic one-sidedness.In contrast, Mr. Keating is presented as a representative of everything caring, warm and fuzzy, free and spontaneous, which the reader is meant (and manipulated) to identify with. To some extent, this sympathy is earned; the moral crisis at the climax of the book, where the question presented to the characters (and the reader) is whether to cravenly go along with the scapegoating of an innocent or to take a stand against it, is in line with the classic moral tradition of world literature. And the idea that assessing the greatness of a given poem is a "relatively simple" exercise that can be reduced and graphed as a mathematical formula is rightly called out as ludicrous. (I didn't think anybody would seriously claim that, but though the textbook and its author here are fictitious, the passage that's read is paraphrased from an actual influential textbook.) At the same time, not every idea that Keating propounds is worthy of endorsement either. He's certainly right to encourage his pupils to really live, to think for themselves and to be all they can be, and to appreciate great literature; but engaging with the latter is more than a matter of reading into it anything you want, and while disagreeing with a textbook author is fine, mutilating a book by tearing out passages you disagree with, throwing them in the trash and stamping on them is NOT fine. (At times, he appears to simply be getting the boys to substitute one form of group-think for another.)While the book has some profanity and vulgarisms (but no obscenity), that element isn't pronounced, there's no explicit or even implied sex, and interpersonal violence is confined to non-lethal beatings. But that said, for sensitive readers this novel could come with trigger warnings galore, including for teenage drinking. Some characters' idea of partying is simply drinking themselves into a stupor and pawing the opposite sex, and one character's insta-"love" for a girl at first sight is strictly physical attraction. (Though the Welton administration is wildly indignant at the proposal that the school admit girls, one can't help but think that a co-ed environment would probably be a lot more socially normal, and foster better socialization for being around girls!) You don't have to be familiar with all of the literary works quoted to appreciate the way they're used here; but I benefitted from being pretty familiar with the two that are the most prominent, the Shakespeare play A Midsummer Night's Dream and Vachel Lindsay's great poem "General William Booth Enters Into Heaven."
423743864	I read this when I was fourteen, and at the time, I loved it so much I started rereading it right away. If I recall correctly, at some point I even considered it to be the best book I'd read. I mean, what can you do, fourteen-year-olds get emotional about books. (I still have fond memories of this book and its movie, of course.)
5562177482	من با هیچ کتابی اینطوری گریه نکرده بودم که اشک‌ها نذارن کلمات رو ببینم:)))) آخرش؛ وای این… وای خدای من.هی میخواستم این کتابو بخونم چند سال بود و حتی فیلمشو ببینم اینم باز خیلی سال بود… حس میکردم غمگینم کنه بعد… درست فکر میکردم. خیلی الان ناراحتم.

6405820880	what the hell was that ending??I’ve never seen the movie, so this was my first exposure to this story. It’s def better as a movie i feel like. The writing was movie-esque but a really short read nonetheless. The ending was heartbreaking but i just feel like a lot of this was rushed and nothing was really fleshed out. Like i said, probably a better movie than book cause the movie inspired the book
3927820688	Miałam tylko przejrzeć, a pochłonęłam całość. Poruszająca, wzruszająca i... smutna (pan Kaeting powiedziałby ,,przygnębiająca”), a przy tym zwięzła i dynamiczna. Niesie ze sobą gorzkie, ale i ważne przesłanie. Film dopiero przede mną, a podobno jest jeszcze lepszy. Żałuję, że poznałam ,,Stowarzyszenie Umarłych Poetów” dopiero teraz (w jakiejkolwiek formie), bo dotarło do mnie jak wartościowa jest to historia. Nie powielajcie mojego błędu i sami przekonajcie się o co chodzi :)
3993784925	تاکید کتاب بیشتر بر روی اهمیت پرداختن به رمانتیسیسم هستبه خوبی نشون میده برداشت افراد با ویژگی های محیطی خانوادگی مختلف نسبت به این مقوله چیستفردی که در خانواده متمول بزرگ شده با فردی که واقعا عاشق شده و فردی که از فشار ها و محدودیت های خانوادگیش به تنگ اومده واکنش های متفاوتی نسبت به رومانتیسیسم دارند و این مساله تو همه زمان های تاریخ بوده مختص یه برهه زمانی خاص نیست و تو این کتاب به خوبی برداشت های مختلف آدم های مختلف نسبت به این موضوع آشکار میشه و یک مساله خیلی مهم داخل این کتاب وجود داره اینکه در موقع روبرو شدن با بحران ها، برخورد جمعی و فردی افراد درون جامعه نسبت به این مساله چیستیکی آدم فروشی میکنه و بقیه از او نفرت میکنند و یکی سعی میکنه تنها خودش حرف بزنه که چون تنهاست نتیجه ای به بار نمیاره و فرصت استفاده از باقی علم را از دست میدهد و عده زیادی خاموشی را ترجیح میدهند و سعی میکنند به جز راهی که پیش رویشان گشودند به چیز دیگری فکر نکنندتو چنین شرایطی اگر فردی بخواد ساز مخالف بزنه آیا مابقی باهاش همسو میشوند یا خیرمنو ناخودآگاه یاد فیلم "دو راه حل برای یک مسئله" عباس کیارستمی انداخت به نظرم دیدن این فیلم و خواندن این کتاب با هم مساله را روشن میکند که توصیه میکنم مشاهده کنید:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7msai...
4133249431	La verdad es que es un poco raro sentarte a leer un libro basado en un guion de un película que ya sabes de memoria (el guion de Tom Schulman que de paso gano el premio Oscar es anterior al libro) pero como la película tuvo tanto boom decidieron hacerlo y la verdad les quedo bastante bien aunque quizás encuentro un poco suavizado en el libro el personaje de Neil Perry y su amistad con Todd Anderson, quizás una forma de hacer mas llevadera la tragedia que nos espera. Ambos libro y película son maravillosos, no se los pierda. Seguro los disfrutaran tanto como nosotros.Video reseña completa en:https://www.instagram.com/p/CShtDbvlcdQ/
2635719848	من به جنگل رفتم چون سر آن داشتم که آگاهانه زندگی کنم. من بر آن شدم که ژرف بِزیم و تمامی جوهر حیات را بمکم و هر آنچه را که زندگی نیست ریشه‌کن کنم. تا آن دم که مرگ به سراغم می‌آید چنین نپندارم که نزیسته‌ام.‌من فیلم رو ندیدم اما کتاب برای من که خودم معلم هستم معنای واقعی همین زندگی و شرایط فعلی هست. خودم رو کیتینگ دیدم در مقابل فشار خانواده‌ها و نظام آموزشی. قطعا همه‌ی ما روزی دبیر یا استادی داشتیم که فارغ از تدریس‌های معمول بهمون درس زندگی داده. کاش فضایی برای بودن کیتینگ‌ها بذاریم.

5438429083	احتمالا قراره یه گفتگو با خودم بشه تا یه ریویوی پیشنهادی..به هرحال،بار اول که شروع کردم به خوندنش، بعد دو سه چپتر متوجه شدم الان رو مود آشنا شدن با دست کم ۷ کرکتر اصلی کتاب نیستم؛ ولی این یه دراپ نبود..تا اینکه یک روز قبل از آغاز 2024 دوباره از اول مرورش کردم و ادامه دادم چون می‌دونستم زمان درستیه برای خوندنش.وایب دارک آکادمیا - شعر - جوانی - اشتیاق - و زنده شدن رویاهای مرده و...دیگه چی می‌خواستم؟جمله ها و شعرهای مورد علاقه م توش زیادن پس فقط بهتون میگم خودتون بخونینش.بعد از دیدن فیلمش هم می‌تونم بگم جفتشونو به یه اندازه دوست داشتم :')💫 جان کیتینگ، یه تلنگر بود برای بازگشت به دنیایی که توش زنده و آزادیم.دنیای رویاهایی که همش ازشون دَم می‌زنیم ولی با همین به اصطلاح واقعیت ها و ترس ها و قدم برنداشتن هامون، خودمونو به بند کشیدیم و محدود کردیم تا توی قالبی معقول قرار بگیریم.نیازی نیست حتما دیوانه وار مسیر رو طی کنیم تا با عواقب اجتناب ناپذیرش رو به رو بشیم چون برای انتخاب ها باید بار مسئولیتشون رو هم بپذیریم.چیزی که درواقع نیازه اینه که فقط انجامش بدیم به درست ترین و خالصانه ترین شکل..Seize the day ♥️ اگه قراره در نهایت قلبم به وسیله سیلی واقعیت بشکنه، می‌خوام در انتهای این هدیه که اسمش زندگیه، با وجدانی آسوده، جاودانه و خشنود بمیرم.# کارپه دیم❌️ خطر اسپویل ❌️بهش امتیاز 4.5 دادمچون به طور دیفالت، نمی‌تونم با مقوله خودکشی ارتباط برقرار کنم. همین :)
1071745685	جالب اين است كه اين كتاب بعد از فيلمش در ايران ترجمه وچاپ شد ..من خودم ابتدا فيلمش را ديدم وبعد كتابش را خواندم ...دست مايه رمان نقد پوسيدگي قوانين سختگيرانه و پوچي افتخار ومباهات به اصول وعقايد از مد افتاده اموزشي است ..هميشه به اقتضاي نسل جديد بايد اموزش وپرورش تحول يابد ...بايد خواست نوجوانان وروحيات انان مورد توجه قرار گيرد وتعليم بايد براساس علاقه وخواست دانش اموزان باشد ..فضاهاي اموزشي بايد مدرن شوند ونحوه اموزش بايد جالب و شور انگيز باشد تا انگيزه كافي براي ياد گيري به وجود ايد...در اين رمان تمام والدين بسيار سختگير ومبادي ادابند انها مدعي هستند كه فرزندانشان بايد دكتر يا مهندس يا دانشمند شوند در حالي كه فرزند يكي دلش ميخواهد نويسنده شود وديگري شاعر ويكي ميخواهد بازيگر باشد ....از نظر والدين انها پرداختن به ادبيات وشاعري و نويسندگي كاري پوچ وبي مغز است ...وپايان ماجرا يك تراژدي غمناك است ..از ترجه بي نقص اقاي حميد خادمي هم نميتوان تقدير نكرد ..
634755990	فقط میتونم بگم عالی بود. اونجایی که میگه: "اگه درباره مساله ای مطمئن هستید، خودتون رو وادارید که به یه نحو دیگه درباره ش فکر کنید، حتی اگه بدونید که این دیدگاه تازه ی شما نادرست یا احمقانه است. وقتی مطلبی میخونید، تنها فکر نویسنده رو مد نظر قرار ندید، کمی درنگ کنید و ببینید نظر خودنون درباره ی اون موضوع چیه" خیلی وصف حال این روزگار ماهاست.

2521442545	¡Oh, capitán, mi capitán!Amo el libro tanto como amo la película en sí. Aún recuerdo la primera vez que la vi, y la emoción que me provoca cada vez que la vuelvo a ver. El libro hizo lo mismo. De acuerdo, es una versión más corta y revisada de la película, por lo que a veces parece pasar borrosa, pero no le quita nada a la película. Cada escena crítica todavía se desarrolla de manera elaborada. Compré este libro para recordar todas las grandes escenas y citas que anhelo cuando no estoy viendo la película. Puede que sea parcial porque amo mucho la película, pero el libro fue igual de bueno para mí.Muestra el poder de la literatura y cómo afecta a los jóvenes en sus acciones. Ahora tenemos la suerte de poder leer todos los libros que queremos, por lo que la mayoría de nosotros olvidamos el valor de la palabra escrita. Por otro lado, "El club de los poetas muertos" es un homenaje a la vida. Enseña lo importante que es aprender a ver la belleza, incluso cuando la fealdad parece prevalecer. Enseña lo importante que es luchar por tus sueños, incluso cuando las probabilidades están en tu contra. Incluso si pierdes, seguirás siendo un ganador, porque no habrás traicionado quién eres en realidad.
2738942395	Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying;And this same flower that smiles today Tomorrow will be dying.The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun, The higher he's a-getting,The sooner will his race be run, And nearer he's to setting.That age is best which is the first, When youth and blood are warmer;But being spent, the worse, and worst Times still succeed the former. Then be not coy, but use your time, And while ye may, go marry;For having lost but once your prime, You may forever tarry.Splendid
5177771196	i just have one thing to say… you can really tell that this came AFTER the movie. every line was so stilted and just appeared to be recounting a film rather than adding depth & genuine description.so needless to say, i’m so excited to watch the movie (finally) .. it’s been on my list for forever.💌 pre-read: okay i kept eyeing this book on my shelf & people say the movie is one of the best things ever… i know this was written after (?) but id like to save the best for last ✨

3270823124	"El hombre nunca ha sido tan libre cómo cuando sueña"El profesor Keating nos enseña a hacer lo que creamos que está bien, hacer lo que pensamos, hacer lo que sentimos, hacer lo que deseamos, hacer lo que nos dice el corazón que hagamos, aunque a veces no coincida con lo que nos dice la razón, hacer feliz al que nos rodea porque esto nos hace felices a nosotros mismos, hacer de la vida un momento para disfrutarla y saborearla como si fuera la última, en definitiva: Carpe Diem.4.5
1866745904	Wiele słyszałam na temat tego, że film jest znacznie lepszy od książki i mam nadzieje, że tak jest. Fabuła ma ogromny potencjał, ale całość nie rozwija dostatecznie wszystkich wątków, bohaterowie nie dostają wystarczająco dużo miejsca i ciężko się z nimi zżyć. Szkoda, bo to taka historia, którą można by było analizować bez końca, gdyby była... głębsza?PS Bardzo kojarzyła mi się z Tajemną historią.
