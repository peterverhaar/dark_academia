1057563110	”All the same, Murderess is a strong word to have attached to you. It has a smell to it, that word---musky and oppressive, like dead flowers in a vase. Sometimes at night I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, Murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt across the floor.” Sketches made of Grace Marks and James McDermott during their sensationalized trial.Grace Marks, at the age of 16 in 1843, was arrested along with James McDermott for the murders of their employer, Thomas Kinnear, and his mistress/housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. The murders were rather sensationalized in Canadian society, what with the cold blooded brutality and the fact that a young, rather beautiful, young woman was involved. McDermott was sentenced to hang, while Marks was saved from the gallows by the spirited defence of her lawyer. She spent the next thirty years of her life incarcerated, first in an asylum and then in a prison. This story really picked up several years later when Doctor Simon Jordan decided to make a study of her and hoped to unlock some of her missing memories. See, there were key elements that she didn’t remember about that day that would help him to determine if she was truly a murderess or merely an unwilling accomplice. Jordan was struck by her from the very first moment he met her. ”Her eyes were unusually large, it was true, but they were far from insane. Instead they were frankly assessing him. It was as if she were contemplating the subject of some unexplained experiment; as if it were he, and not she, who was under scrutiny.”And then there was this observation of Grace by Jordan, as well:”She’s thinner now, less full in the face; and whereas the picture shows a pretty woman, she is now more than pretty. Or other than pretty. The line of her cheek has a marble, a classic, simplicity; to look at her is to believe that suffering does indeed purify.” “Other than pretty” implied further depths to her beyond just the surface beauty that captured the imagination of a ghoulish public. He might not know it, but he was already smitten with Grace and in danger of tumbling head over heels in love with her. It is hard to keep control of a series of interviews if you have become interested in more than just the deeds of the individual. As an added distraction every mother in Toronto with a daughter was trying to manufacture ways to throw their pretty daughters in front of this very eligible bachelor. He was a doctor after all.”As one season’s crop of girls proceeds into engagement and marriage, younger ones keep sprouting up, like tulips in May. They are now so young in relation to Simon that he has trouble conversing with them; it’s like talking to a basketful of kittens.”They were fresh, so new they were barely out of the packaging of their youth, and of course virginal. What every man should desire,...right? Well, if one doesn’t mind vacuousness.As fascinating as Grace’s story is, I found myself becoming even more engrossed with the story of Dr. Simon Jordan and his desire driven demons. His landlady, whose husband had absconded on a bout of debauchery, was also proving to be a damsel in distress as her only source of income became her one lodger. ”Her face is heart-shaped, her skin milky, her eyes large and compelling; but although her waist is slender, there is something metallic about it, as if she is using a short length of stove-pipe instead of stays. Today she wears her habitual expression of strained anxiety; she smells of violets, and also of camphor.”She was a beauty past her prime, but still she was compellingly sexy. He felt this attraction against his will. There was no hope for a relationship. She was married and too old to ever be acceptable to his family or his class. He was supposed to marry one of those inane, young ladies. ”It would be one way of deciding his fate, or settling his own hash; or getting himself out of harm’s way. But he won’t do it; he’s not that lazy, or weary; not yet.” I can’t help, but think of Newland Archer from The Age of Innocence, who allowed himself to be trapped into what was expected of him, as well. What if Archer had escaped with Countess Olenska?I still pine for him to escape.So even though the landlady was forbidden, bruised fruit, he couldn’t help, but notice that...“Her lips are full, but fragile, like a rose on the verge of collapse.”This was one of the many times when I had to read a Margaret Atwood line many times, rolled it around the surface of my tongue, so that I could taste the sweet, the bitter, and the savory of that beautifully written line. Dr. Jordan was starting to have odd thoughts and unsettling dreams of murders committed by himself. He started digging in the garden under the pretense of planting a garden, but it seemed, even to his subconscious self, that he was loosening the soil for...the corpse of his landlord if he should return or maybe a stack of bodies of those from which he wished to escape. It would put him on an equal footing with one particular woman. ”Murderess, murderess, he whispers to himself. It has an allure, a scent almost. Hothouse gardenias. Lurid, but also furtive. He imagines himself breathing it as he draws Grace toward him, pressing his mouth against her. Murderess. He applies it to her throat like a brand.”This novel is based on the true story of Grace Marks. History lost track of her once she was released from prison after nearly thirty years of incarceration. No tombstone is known to mark her grave. She simply vanished into the woodwork of a new America. Atwood has not only brought her to life, but has seamlessly and creatively put words of putty and glue into the missing pieces. I wonder every time I finish an Atwood why I don’t read her more frequently. Sarah Gadon plays Grace Marks in the seriesNetflix has recently launched the first season of a new show based on Alias Grace. It spurred me to get this book read that I had planned to read three years ago. I was wooed by other more pressing books, and what a fool I was. I don’t know how I feel about watching the series. I’m as sure that it is good as I am sure that it will disappoint. I will eventually work up the courage to watch it, but I think I will luxuriate in reverence for the book for a while.

768822743	"When you are in the middle of a story it isn't a story at all, but only a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness, a wreckage of shattered glass and splintered wood; like a house in a whirlwind, or else a boat crushed by the icebergs or swept over the rapids, and all aboard powerless to stop it. It's only afterwards that it becomes anything like a story at all. When you are telling it, to yourself or to someone else."This powerful passage is from Margaret Atwood's 1996 novel Alias Grace. She developed the novel from her television script "The Servant Girl" of 1974, and it was shortlisted for the Booker prize. The story is about the notorious 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery in Canada. Grace Marks and James McDermott, both servants in the household, were convicted of the crime. McDermott was hanged and Marks was sentenced to life imprisonment.Alias Grace is based on factual events. However the author explains that she has used verifiable facts wherever possible, but that where there were none she felt at liberty to embroider or invent. One of her creations is the character of a doctor, Simon Jordan, who researches the case. Although he is conducting research into criminal behaviour, he slowly becomes more and more personally involved in the story which is gradually unveiled to him by Grace Marks. He finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile the gentle, self-controlled woman he sees every day with the murderess who has been convicted.The novel follows the story of Grace's life, as she relates it to Doctor Jordan. These parts with Grace as the viewpoint character are cleverly written with no punctuation. Therefore, because they are written from Grace's point of view, the reader is never sure whether Grace is speaking or thinking. Atwood's use of language is poignant and evocative in these descriptions of events. Colours, smells, feelings - all are described in minute detail, which would be extraordinary feats of expression if spoken aloud by Grace herself. An example of this is the quotation above. It is attributed to Grace, but was this spoken aloud? Were these her own innermost thoughts? Or is it being addressed to the reader?Other parts are written from Doctor Jordan's point of view, although Atwood uses the third person in these passages, whereas for Grace, it is always "I". This switching between points of view makes the reader uncertain, and the narrative quite edgy. In addition, authentic newspaper articles and letters from doctors and those in charge of Grace during her time in prisons and asylums are interspersed at the end of some of the chapters. They are not chronological, which again adds to the disjointed feel of the text. Most of the detail is of events prior to the murders, and some date from a long time earlier, but we do find out what happens to both Grace and Doctor Jordan after the long consultations. Although in the afterword Atwood states that the facts are inconclusive, throughout the reader is trying to ascertain what really happened. We feel there is a mystery. (view spoiler)[ Was Grace insane, as some people believed? Was she a calculating murderess? Was she, as Doctor Jordan was grasping at, suffering from an as yet unidentified mental illness such as multiple personality? (hide spoiler)] At this distance we will never know, and in any event this is a novel. But it is very well-constructed and parts are beautifully written.
334926702	I keep kicking myself for having ditched the Atwood Speaking Gala at A.W.P. in Chicago this year (2012). The fierce literati kept the attendance so high that it was virtually as if Lady Gaga herself were to give a lecture on her impressive body of work. I was more interested in walking all around Chitown, anyway, but I really (sorta) regret not having nabbed a coveted seat. She was probably amazing: uberclever & brilliant.Without two minor (teeny) infractions, “Alias Grace” is pretty much a well-rounded, totalizing, COMPLETE novel—one which paints a full world with such realistic colors that the reader quickly forgets that the plot actually comes from the 1850’s Annals of Canadian Crime. Before I start extolling it madly, let me quickly state what those two “minor infractions” are: Grace’s 1st-person accounts are not completely authentic-sounding; they are far too articulate and intelligent—symbols become too clearly presented to the reader (who should feel slightly MORE confused, as psyches are often deep chasms) as the author’s own signature is made overly-clear in Grace’s own declarations (Atwood adds on her character’s openly-questionable credibility pretty early on, to her credit). Also, there is this feeling that without that added spice of changing POV’s and tenses, the plot would have been banal & tedious—the middle indeed sags, but the conclusion, the last 80 pages of it, is ultimately positively stellar. Luckily for us, the writer was hyperaware of how much of her own added element would befit this seemingly-simple story of homicide. Those symbols of femininity (the red peonies, the patchwork quilt, the washing & scrap-booking) have never been placed in such intense context before—I was genuinely enthralled, impressed like a rabid Atwood fanboy. I truly like this one, perhaps not as much as her fantastic “Oryx and Crake,” but far more than her most famous “Handmaid’s Tale” & her more recent “Year of the Flood.”
2684639004	‘if we were all on trial for our thoughts, we would all be hanged.’ the year is 1843 and grace marks has been arrested and convicted for her alleged involvement in two murders. she is only 16 years old and will spend the next 29 years incarcerated. but what would possess a young girl to commit such a crime? and why did she give three conflicting confessions of what happened? was it a crime of passion or unfortunate circumstances?the answers to these questions is exactly what dr. jordan hopes to discover. as the doctor prompts graces memories, the reader is immersed in a story surrounded by sex, violence, and insubordination, with the uncomfortable realisation that not everything is so black and white.atwood is a very thorough storyteller. its evident by reading this that atwood has exhausted all sources when researching grace marks and that tragic day in history. and whilst the subject matter is hauntingly gripping, my only complaint it this is a little dry. its a long exposé of graces character and is very slow at times (especially when recounting her early life), almost to the point where i become emotionally deattached from everything that was happening. but i cant deny that this dramatic tale is thought-provoking, as much as it is entertaining. its a definite must read for those who enjoy the true crime of historical fiction. ↠ 3.5 stars
1090520826	This book is a gem. A work of fiction, but based on actual historical events, Alias Grace is the story of the convicted murderess, Grace Marks. Sixteen year old Grace and fellow servant James McDermott are said to have brutally murdered their employer, Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper and supposed mistress, Nancy Montgomery, in Canada during the 1840’s. However, Grace claimed to have no memory of her own culpability in these murders. Both were found guilty; James McDermott was condemned to death and Grace Marks was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Provincial Penitentiary in Kingston, Canada.In the novel, Grace’s story is revealed to Dr. Simon Jordan, a fictional, progressive, young doctor who is trained in the study of mental illnesses. Dr. Jordan’s expertise has been requested by a group of individuals who are petitioning for a pardon for Grace. Grace’s story, as she relates it in the first person to Dr. Jordan, is so very compelling, I could not put this book down. I was immediately drawn to Grace as she so expressively recounted her memories of her childhood, her migration to Canada from Ireland, her new life as a servant, her trial and her life in prison. Just like Dr. Jordan, I at first wondered about her guilt, her sanity, and whether or not she was speaking with candor or artifice. The prose here is so wonderfully moving. At the end of one of her sessions with Dr. Jordan, Grace says, either to the reader or to herself:“While he writes, I feel as if he is drawing me; or not drawing me, drawing on me – drawing on my skin – not with the pencil he is using, but with an old-fashioned goose pen, and not with the quill end but with the feather end. As if hundreds of butterflies have settled all over my face, and are softly opening and closing their wings.”“But underneath that is another feeling, a feeling of being wide-eyed awake and watchful. It’s like being wakened suddenly in the middle of the night, by a hand over your face, and you sit up with your heart going fast, and no one is there. And underneath that is another feeling still, a feeling like being torn open; not like a body of flesh, it is not painful as such, but like a peach; and not even torn open, but too ripe and splitting open of its own accord. And inside the peach there’s a stone.”Grace also has a way of discerning others that is at times both shrewd and witty. I felt as if she could easily have switched roles with Dr. Jordan – she being the analyst and he being the subject of her scrutiny rather than vice versa. And, Dr. Jordan, I felt was verily in need of some rehabilitation of his own psyche! In addition, I found even her general observations of her surroundings to be rather droll. I found myself laughing out loud on occasion. In her description of a bustle, she says “it was like having another bum tied on top of your real one and the two of them following you around like a tin bucket tied to a pig.” Grace’s narrations of her dreams, too, were so vivid; I could feel the stirring emotions these evoked. “I was seeing it all for the first time, although I also knew I had been there before, as is the way in dreams… And I longed to be there, although in the dream I was there already; but I had a great yearning towards this house, for it was my real home.”I grew to admire Grace throughout this book. But, was she innocent or guilty of the heinous crime for which she was convicted? Are we, the readers, able to come to a conclusion based on Ms. Atwood’s spin on this factual event? Or, is that not the real purpose here – to come to a veritable conclusion? No matter what you conclude, the consummate storytelling in this Atwood novel is well worth your time.
21569209	Margaret Atwood occupies a strange nook in my heart. She's become a bit of a chore lately, as I'm including her in my senior honors thesis; on the other hand, I've now read almost all of her novels, and while none are bad or even...not really good. Just that because a few of the novels shine so brightly, that the others seem duller in comparison.Well, Alias Grace is a supernova. It's an absolutely phenomenal novel, and a truly thrilling read. It's a departure for Atwood, as it's historical fiction (of course, she did do the Journals of Susanna Moodie before), but moreover, it employs similar narrative techniques as detective fiction, while turning them on their head--in any case, it's definitely a page-turner, which is not something you usually mention in conjunction with Atwood. This doesn't discount the literary merit--there's enough meat in the book to write a dissertation or five on it. There's something quite fresh in her style here, with many many passages I absolutely had to read aloud to whomever was (un)fortunate enough to be near me as I read.The general structure of the novel is from the outset quite fascinating--each section is tied under the flag of a quilt pattern, and each begins with a series of epigraphs, combining historical documents, poetry, "witness accounts" and so forth--ultimately questioning the validity of each, and how we reconfigure the past with necessarily limited frameworks at hand. Writing a fictionalized account of a historical person is itself an indictment of history, but Atwood takes it so much farther, and in much more wonderfully 'political' ways. Grace is still a frustrating enigma by the end of the text, but you'll adore her and her sly moves, her secret longings, and her storytelling ability--Dr. Jordan, as we discover, has no idea what he's getting into with her. It's certainly a dark read, and often I would have to lay the book down for at least a minute or two to catch my breath. But Atwood has a wonderful way of infusing humor into even the bleakest of moments, so there were just as many times when I found myself laughing aloud. This book will not leave you for a long time.
3450918046	Margaret Atwood had a long time fascination with 19th century Canada's most sensational murders and trial, where the Irish-Canadian 15 year old housemaid, Grace Marks was co-accused and divided many - those that thought she was a cold killer and those that thought she was a tad naive and just another victim of the 20-year old James McDermott. In Alias Grace, Atwood takes us for a whirl with a number of 'well-meaning' narrators pro and anti - Grace; and one honourable and honest, but stoic narrator or a very cunning unreliable narrator ...Grace Marks, devil, angel or something in between?With such a salacious topic to write about, it's almost a marvel that the book still completely centres around Grace and what we learn from what she thinks and tells us. I sat down almost presuming innocence from the off, her being a highly underprivileged girl with no real power, yet despite this, the more I read, the more torn I was. That's what I really liked about the way the story is presented to the reader, the more you know, the less you know. Yes Grace was and is treated horrendously from her childhood through to her trial and then imprisonment; but did that make her a murderer or did it make her vulnerable to being caught up in a murder?This is technically an epistolary novel, although some of the entries are so long it doesn't feel like it is. Atwood conjures up a not often seen Canada a few years before the American Civil War, and through a number of characters sets the out the status quo of the time. The historical backdrop is fascinating, as was the way they diagnosed and treated mental health; but of everything, it made me think, when I realised that sexism may have been the key to Grace's escape from the death penalty! Yet another Atwood good read, in this case, one that I feel went on too long - 8 out of 122020 read
1342526246	So, so good!Alias Grace questions the existence of an absolute truth. Moreover, how is what we think of as the truth informed by power structures (specifically, gender and class disparages)? Can someone who is deemed mad tell the truth? Who do you believe when push comes to shove? Even though this book was written in the 90s and is set in the middle of the 19th century, it remains an incredibly relevant read. I couldn’t help but read this story as commentary on current developments, such as the #MeToo movement – and what poignant commentary at that! Margaret Atwood manages to point out injustice and sexism, both overt and subtle, and I marked a lot of passages while reading. She also gives insight into the historical treatment of mental disorders and the development of what we know think of as psychiatry, which I found very fascinating.Apart from the interesting and important topics it discusses, Alias Grace also tells such a well crafted story and it managed to keep me completely engrossed while reading. It remains an ambiguous read until the end and it’s very much the kind of book that only gives you answers if you want them, while also offering some kind of resolution and closure, and I really appreciated that.I'd highly recommend Alias Grace and it's definitely the kind of book that will stick with me for a while!
60894764	At the very heart of certain narratives is a lacuna, to which the reader is drawn ineluctibly, as the centre of a whirlpool of meanings. It may indicate something essentially unknowable, ineffable - the lacuna in the Old Testament is when God tells Moses I AM THAT I AM, which lets us know in no uncertain terms that this thing is not of logic or language, whatever it may be; the lacuna of the New Testament is Christ's three days in the tomb - we are not told anything about that, it is unknowable. Or this gap in the story may indicate simply something someone does not wish to tell us - the very heart of the matter, the thing of shame, the motive. Here the gap is a void or avoidance. Psychologically powerful avoidance fuelled by intense guilt makes a hair-raising narrative, as the reader, writer and protagonist gradually converge together and find themselves in the belly of the beast - two memorable examples from non-fiction are Fritz Stangl's horrible wrestling with his past as commandant of Treblinka in Gitta Sereney's series of interviews with him ("Into that Darkness") and Michaud & Aynesbury's interviews with Ted Bundy ("Conversations with a Killer"). In both cases we are caught up in the subtle and confrontational stratagems the interviewers use to get the monster to acknowledge an identification with the previous self who committed the atrocities. Stangl ferociously hangs on to the "it was just a job, a really really difficult job" line until he cracks - and how dramatic to read that a day or so after he finally - finally - admits that he was personally responsible for what he had done, he dies of a heart attack. Bundy constructs a way of describing his crimes by "speculating" about them in the third person, contemplating how the person who perpetrated them "might have been" feeling, of how he "was reacting inappropriately to stress in his life". He edges to the very rim of acceptance of guilt but can't manage the swan-dive into what we non-serial killers assume to be the cleansing waters of catharsis which await those who accept their crimes and seek atonement. Alias Grace's story likewise is a stately sarabande of 550 pages around the central question - did she do it? Suspended from that mystery, the ponderous but pillowy narrative describes the life of Grace Marks in her own languid hyper-observational manner (a great fictional voice) and counterposes this with the fervid cavortings of the brain doctor sent to ferret out her great secret. He's quite a scream. So anyway, this book is squarely in that genre I call Modern Victorian, in which the contemporary novelist writes us another great big Victorian story but being modern can put in all the filth and flesh, all the naming of parts which the real Victorian novelists couldn't do. It turns out, from what I've read so far, to be a great idea. Consider these -1) The Crimson Petal and the White (Michel Faber) - completely brilliant and nearly 1000 pages too 2) The Quincunx (Charles Palliser) - completely brilliant and just over 1000 pages3) Fingersmith (Sarah Waters) - yes, just about completely brilliant too4) The French Lieutenant's Woman (John Fowles) - acknowledged by all to be fairly brilliantVery glad to add Alias Grace to this select list and will be happy to grab up other Modern Victorians as they swim my way. Alias Grace likes, in its modern way, to leave a lot of stuff unanswered and without chucking in a huge horrid spoiler here, I can't reveal why I think that part of the Central Revelatory Scene was pure codswallop, but that didn't make no never mind. Margaret Atwood's big book sails onward, sad, sumptuous, and very slightly sexy too.
2000693379	¡Primera lectura de Atwood y primer acierto! :)Alias Grace es una historia sórdida y cruel, muy bien documentada y que resulta apasionante aún en el relato de los sucesos más sencillos... hay dos cosas que me han sorprendido especialmente, el toque sobrenatural y la ambigüedad del relato y los personajes. Obviamente, seguiré con Margaret Atwood :)
2474723201	”If we were all on trial for our thoughts, we would all be hanged.”A fictionalised retelling of the story of Grace Marks and the part that she may or may not have played in the murders of Thomas Kinnear and Nancy Montgomery. Grace was only 16 when she accused of murdering her employer and his housekeeper.This is a fantastic mix of true crime and historical fiction! Atwood blends the two wonderfully, even including actual excerpts from reports and books, as well as pictures of the two charged with the murders. Atwood’s research and attention to detail is very apparent, although I held off on reading about the true crime case that inspired the novel until after I had finished.The story kicks off with Grace in Kingston Penitentiary, serving her sentence for these murders. That is until Doctor Simon Jordan becomes involved in her case and tries to unlock some of the memories that she claims are hidden away. What unravels is a slow-paced yet addictive read, brimming with sex, violence and commentaries on both class and gender. And I could not get enough!My overwhelming reaction to this book was to simply be in awe of Atwood’s writing and wit. She provides such sharp astute observations that are equally intelligent and droll - I definitely sniggered on more than a few occasions.To summarise, Atwood is a goddamn queen. Alias Grace surpasses The Handmaid’s Tale as my favourite Atwood to date and is up there in my top 10 books of the year so far! I loved every single page! 5 stars.
3645045177	This review contains spoilersAlias Grace by Margaret Atwood is an absolute belter of a book. I was absorbed from the very first page, it’s a chunkster, but as we say – it’s not too long if it’s good enough.We follow the life of Grace Marks who is accused and found guilty of murdering Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery. Grace was accused of committing this crime with the distasteful James McDermott. Halfway through this read, I discovered this story is based on a real case in Kingston, Canada back in 1843. This added gravitas to this story for me, Atwood says she ”has not changed any known facts”, this made the story even more meaningful. Grace is found guilty along with McDermott, the latter hangs but Grace evades the noose and is sent to the penitentiary, ultimately spending close to thirty years incarcerated. She spends some of that time in an asylum and a great deal of her time working as some sort of housekeeper in the prison Governor’s house – as a trusted inmate. Grace is fortunate to have a band of supporters, ‘well-to-do’ acolytes, advocating for her release. Another main character is Dr Simon Jordan (fictional) who spends hours interviewing Grace to try and recover memories of the crime, this to try and assist in the determination of guilt or innocence. Jordan is used by Atwood as a tool to uncover Grace’s life to the reader. Well, well, well. The author really toyed with me on this one – I spent most of my time totally sympathetic to Grace Marks, she had such a rough life, coming out from Ireland in squalid conditions, subject to ordinary and sometimes terrible treatment - probably a very typical life of a poor woman of the time. I felt sorry for her, to me she was obviously influenced by the vile McDermott as he was a very nasty piece of work. He was violent, moody, manipulative – not the type you’d sit down and have scones and jam with. So, Grace had my sympathy, but more importantly, I started to fall for this woman – I thought the way she slowly revealed her story to Dr Jordan was so gentle, timid, reserved and calm. Grace didn’t have a bad bone in her body, she was angelic. In addition, my crush on her included my imagination creating this physically beautiful creature (after all I am a bloke), but in a way where she didn’t flaunt it as she probably wasn’t even aware of how beautiful she was. Yep, I was in her corner, a vial of smelling salts, water bottle, liniment oil, a couple of dry towels at the ready and screaming words of encouragement - You Go-Girl!!.Having said that, Atwood introduced bloody uncertainty didn’t she? Grace’s recall of events surrounding the murders was vague. Why didn’t she warn Mr Kinnear (or someone) of McDermott’s premeditated intention to murder? (well, she was obviously under McDermott’s spell – wasn’t she?) But she could have been involved, she may have given McDermott sexual favours – God forbid!! She may have been intimate with Mr Kinnear (slightly more palatable). Grace certainly had an antagonistic relationship with Nancy, who was capricious and nasty. There were some dynamics – or let’s say hypothetical dynamics in that household, where one could dream up of her having good cause to be involved. Oh dear, what to think!!! Some people at the time thought she was evil, manipulative and psychologically inclined to commit such an atrocious act. Grace may have even had multiple-personality-disorder. We may have witnessed a bit of this during a particularly confronting hypnosis session. But was she acting when she was ‘under’ hypnosis? Aaaarrgghh.It’s this type of uncertainty, this kind of dilemma that caused me to think about this book ALL THE TIME. I couldn’t wait to get back to it – I wanted to find evidence of her innocence. But even evidence of guilt would have helped me – at least then I could let go, move on from Grace and get my life back in order and start eating, have a shave, maybe even a shower. But no – this is all unresolved (as far as this reader is concerned). Yes, she was eventually pardoned and lived a quiet life of domestic bliss with a man who had a crush on her back in the day. A nice fella – so that part of the story was resolved. Her happiness.But was she guilty?There is a series on Netflix about this story – of course, I’d love to watch it. But I am hesitant as it may destroy the vivid minds-eye images I have of beautiful Grace, of all the other characters (good and bad) and the times of the 1840s – whether it be the life of the rich, those living in squalor or in captivity. I might have to give it a while. It should be in black and white, with Grace the only character in colour – but that type of editorial influence might be a bit obvious.5 Stars

4159100789	A wee bit overlong in parts, but overall a great piece of historical fiction.
1220967410	Alias Grace's most obtrusive weakness is chronic long-windedness, which is sure to thoroughly annoy readers with an impatient streak. Atwood had a tendency to spend exorbitant amounts of time on trivial subject matter. This book is very long, unnecessarily long.This story is a fictional account of a true case of murder in the 1800's. I appreciate ambiguity on fiction, but what is the point of reconstructing a crime, examining it, if you do not give any opinion as to what actually took place? Frustrating. The book segways into a disappointing monotony which leaves the reader bored and no longer interested as to the fate of the protagonist. I read such glowing reviews of her books from others that I always want to read one more because I feel I am missing something, or because it has been a long time since I've read one and I feel that I have forgotten. But ---- I read one more and remember that even thought her writing is excellent, her novels leave me in a cold and lonely place when I am finished – a place to which I do not wish to return. I think that after four Atwood novels, I am giving it up.
2998200194	I had just finished Alias Grace! Meanwhile, the news came from the book world that the jury broke the rule and now there are two books that can be read this year with the same tagging of Booker prize winner 2019 on them. Peter Florence, the chair of the five-member judging panel of Booker prize said, “The more we talked about them, the more we found we loved them both so much we wanted them both to win.” What can be a better time than this to say something about a book of Margaret Atwood, when she once more bagged this prize with Evaristo and also became the oldest ever Booker prize winner. Congrats to both of them from my side as well! So here is this book... Alias Grace….. a unique one!Till the end of this book, I was not mindful of the fact that this book was based on a true historical case of the 1840s. I was reading the entire work with a pure sense of fictional work. When I got there towards the end of this tale my indignation could be explained as of a reader who was trying hard to know the suspense behind the tale but then the book finished and there came an afterword from the author stating this... “Alias Grace is a work of fiction, although it is based on reality. Its central figure, Grace Marks, was one of the most notorious Canadian women of 1840s, having been convicted of murder at the age of sixteen.” However, this superficial rage lasted in me just for a few minutes after finishing the novel and then my overall reading experience of this book brought me back into the normalcy. And once the normalcy was restored, I once again felt the immense delight of reading this tale. Only an astute and highly proficient author can do this...converting a well known and highly publicized real story into a magnificent fictional work…such wonderful storytelling and a very deft art of narration. Grace Marks came to a township of Toronto from Northern Ireland with her father and with her four brothers and four sisters when she was 13 and there she worked for 3 years as a servant and then at the age of 16 got convicted of murders, and then for the next many many years spending her youth in a penitentiary, she remained one of the most celebrated murderesses of her time.Some called her an accomplished actress and a most practiced liar considering her a sham. Others felt she was innocent and sane assuming that at such a tender age she could not commit those heinous crimes. A doctor from Massachusetts Dr. Simon Jordon comes to understand her case after sixteen years. She tells her story and this doctor of her age writes down it with great observation and precaution.She tells and observes him. He listens and infers her. “While he writes I feel as if he is drawing me; or not drawing me, drawing on me – drawing on my skin- not with the pencil he is using but with the old- fashioned goose pen, and not with the quill end but with the feather end. As if hundreds of butterflies settled all over my face, and are softly opening and closing their wings.” This way Atwood narrates the story of Grace Marks through these two characters in an alluring manner. This book is a classic example of class conflict, lust, complicacy of a trial and psychic battles within humans. I enjoyed every part of the book. Dr. Simon’s parallel story with all his desire-driven thoughts gives a holistic fictional sense to this book. You will find so many things here! There is a panoramic sea voyage here, scullery maids and servant girls with their lives and emotions, a portrayal of fear in the upper class of rebellion that had occurred there during that period. An emotional relation between Grace and her friend Mary Whitney is there. There are morose and churlish characters, an interesting paddler, unsolicited relations between the upper-class employer and lower-class worker. The poetry of Atwood reflects through characters as well. Jamie Walsh, an interesting character plays sometimes songs upon his flute: "Tom, Tom, The piper's son,Stole a pig and away he run,And all the tune that he could playWas over the hills and far away" If you are an Atwood fan.. ..Even if you have read her other great works... You cannot miss this book at all!
2753577227	A deeply unsettling book.Want to see my 16 Must Read Women's Prize Nominees on BookTube? Come join me at Hello, Bookworm.📚🐛 In Alias Grace, Atwood fictionalizes the notorious murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery in 1843. Two people were convicted for the crime: James McDermott, who was hanged, and Grace Marks, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Alias Grace centers on Grace, who has no memory of what happened on the day of the murders. Some people believe she’s guilty, others think she’s innocent, while still others say she is evil or even insane. A doctor who specializes in mental illness takes an interest in Grace and spends time with her, trying to unearth the truth about the murders. This tightly woven, mysterious tale of hardship, violence, and uncertainty leaves a lasting impression. It’s a slow burn, yet with every page I marveled at Atwood’s ability to take a sliver of captivating history—what little we know of Grace Marks—and transform it into this phenomenal book. Highly recommend reading the book then watching the Netflix adaptation.
5847681677	Маргарет Атууд е кралица на миражите, недомлъвките, двусмислиците и полусенките. Конкретно в тази книга вещерската им смес се е получила крайно удачно - напрежението държи равномерно и неотслабващо до последната страница. Отличният превод и оформление усилват ефекта.Както винаги с Атууд, криминалната нишка е просто удобен повод за разходка из епохата и из плетениците на човешката душа. В случая с епохата това са средата и втората половина на XIX век в Канада, преплетени с тежката съдба на отчаяните ирландски емигранти, търсещи нов живот в новия свят. Свят все още като по Дикенс, пълен с несправедливости и извращения, част от чиито развъдници са тогавашните затвори и психиатрии. Но и свят в който току се стрелне някой заблуден слънчев лъч, бил той и под формата на мотив за семейна завивка с име “Райското дърво” или “Дамата от езерото.” И - разбира се - запазената марка на Атууд да задълбае в мрака на подтиснатите или отречени човешки стремежи и тайни желания дава облик на цялата история. Безкрайни коридори от криви огледала се вият из всяка страница. От прочетените заглавия на старата канадска дама, това ми се вижда най-майсторско и най-хармонично.————”Аз обаче си мисля, че е имало само едно-единствено дърво и че Плодът на живота и Плодът на доброто и злото са едно и също. И ако човек яде от него, ще умре, а и да не яде, пак ще умре, разликата е само, че онзи, който е ял от този плод, ще е научил повече неща за живота, докато му дойде времето да го напусне.И като гледам как е устроен светът, излиза, че е точно така.”
174351485	Alias Grace, although a work of fiction, is based on one of Canada's most infamous murder cases. In Toronto, in 1843 16-year-old Grace Marks and fellow servant, James McDermott were accused of murdering their employer, Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper and mistress, Nancy Montgomery. Both were sentenced to death and McDermott was hanged. However, Grace's lawyer was able to get her sentence commuted to life imprisonment by arguing her youth, her gender, and, according to him, her feeble-mindedness.The story opens when Grace has been in Kingston Penitentiary for 15 years. This is a period of reform in Canada and a group of clergy and others hire Dr Simon Jordan, a young American psychiatrist, to establish her innocence as Grace claims to have no memory of the actual murders. The story is told from different perspectives. Each chapter begins with an actual quote from the period, including excerpts from the trial, her and James' confessions, newspaper articles, and from Susanna Moodie, an early Canadian writer who went to see Grace, both at the penitentiary and, in the insane asylum, where she spent five years. The story is also told by Grace in the first person while Jordan's part of the story is told in the third.Each chapter is also named after a quilt pattern with a corresponding picture of the pattern and each pattern gives us a hint of what to expect in the chapter. Throughout the story, Grace talks about quilt patterns and she is often pictured piecing a quilt together while telling her story. Grace, frequently, points out that quilts appear differently when seen from different angles and, like the quilts, Grace's story is pieced together from fragments, not all of which seem to fit together. Atwood never establishes the guilt or innocence of Grace. Instead, she leaves it up to the reader to decide whether Grace is the innocent she seems to portray herself or the murdering temptress others have named her. As Grace tells her story, she often admits to the reader, but not to Jordan, that she is telling him what she thinks he wants to hear, so that we are never sure whether to believe any or all of what she says. But this story isn't really about whether Grace is innocent or guilty although guilt plays an important role in the story. It is about class, and status, and about the role of women in Victorian Canada at a time when women, regardless of class, were seen as the weaker sex, feeble of mind and body, always at the mercy of men who invariably seem to betray them. According to Grace, poor women have only three avenues open to them, service in a wealthy household, marriage, or prostitution.Alias grace is a fascinating look at Canada West (Ontario) in Victorian times; it is also an intriguing psychological thriller as well as a brilliant feminist novel. Margaret Atwood is often considered Canada's greatest living writer. It is easy to see why when you read Alias Grace.
2162870967	Una historia que trata sobre la culpabilidad, la memoria (¿puede alguien sentirse culpable por lo que no recuerda?), las diferencias sociales, el sistema penitenciario (por llamarlo de alguna manera), los conocimientos sobre enfermedades mentales y la posición de la mujer en el siglo XIX.Es como si Margaret Atwood hubiera partido de "El cuento de la criada" (la narración subjetiva de una mujer prisionera sin posibilidad de salir) y hubiera profundizado para contarnos los pormenores de una sociedad, la Canadá de mitades/finales del siglo XIX. Es un buen libro histórico, donde se nota el uso y la diversidad de fuentes. Pero sobre todo es una gran novela introspectiva.No quiere tanto aclarar si Grace es culpable o no (no es un libro reivindicativo, como sí lo es un poco "Ritos funerales"), sino que pretende jugar con las posibilidades. Todo el mundo es culpable de algo. Eso no quiere decir que se deba castigar por ley. Todo el mundo, en un momento determinado, puede cometer un delito, eso no quiere decir que sea una mala persona incapaz de redimirse. Lo que a Atwood le interesa analizar es la fina, finísima línea, que existe entre el pensamiento y la acción, entre tener un comportamiento inadecuado y cometer un delito, entre cómo se juzga a una persona u otra según su posición social y/o sexo. Me ha gustado más que "El cuento de la criada" porque creo que en "Alias Grace" se profundiza más en los personajes (al menos en la protagonista) y la historia está más compenetrada con el tema que pretende abordar.Para mí ha sido una lectura interesante y absorbente.
4550270395	Novela de ficción basada en un evento histórico, con un doble homicidio por el que la sirvienta Grace Marks fue condenada a cadena perpetua a los dieciséis años y en la que se recrea su vida con vistas a una posible excarcelación.Una trama intrigante en la que se elucubra acerca de la inocencia, culpabilidad o posible trastorno mental de la protagonista, cuya personalidad parece sencilla e inocente pero poco a poco se intuye más compleja. La autora utiliza un lenguaje coherente y personajes creíbles, construidos muy en consonancia con la época a la que se refiere, y está narrado de forma magistral.
226434921	Leave it to Margaret Atwood to turn a real-crime novel into a conversation about gender and class! I have to say, I never really know what I am getting into with an Atwood novel: she always goes somewhere unexpected, thought-provoking and cleverly multi-layered.Grace Marks was accused - along with stable-hand James McDermott - of murdering her employer and his house-keeper, but her death sentence was commuted to a lifetime imprisonment. Every official version of her story seem to contradict each other and while some people are convinced of her guilt, a rather large group of people insist that she is innocent and wrongly incarcerated. Enter young and rather pompous Dr. Simon Jordan, who is trying to establish an early form of psychology as an accepted science and not charlatanism: since Grace's sanity has been in question since she was arrested while trying to run away with her accomplice, Dr. Jordan wants to try his methods on her to find out whether or not she is sane, and consequently find out whether or not she is guilty of murder.The story is build around these interviews between Grace and the doctor, but also around the historical documentation about Grace Marks: her guilt was never firmly established and her true story remains very mysterious, giving Atwood a great opportunity to speculate on what might have happened.Atwood's characters are always complicated creations. Grace is a strange blend of innocent and proper, while also being too well-aware of the grittier realities of life. But like a true lady, she works hard to keep on the right side of the line of propriety, even after being incarcerated and committed to a lunatics' asylum. Is she a very talented actress, simple-minded or an intelligent woman living in a day and age where being clever is a dangerous quality?Simon Jordan is unbearably snobby and immature: he is one of those learned-men who thinks he is the only one who understands how the world works and who knows better than everybody else. Ironically, while he claims to understand a great deal about the human mind, he doesn't know himself or understand why he does what he does half the time. I greatly enjoyed laughing at him, even if he was often more perceptive of the hypocrisies and double-standards Grace and other women had to deal with.Which leads me to what I found the most fascinating about this novel. It won't surprise anyone to know that women got the short end of the stick in the 1840's, but Atwood takes a subtle path to discuss the inequality issues: Grace is aware that the deck has been stacked against her all her life because she is poor (and a girl), and she is determined to make the best of it, but through her eyes, we see what happens to other women who dare to "misbehave". Mary Whitney's death as a direct result of her so-called transgression (even if without a man's intervention and manipulation, she would have lived), the ridiculous landlady's desires, which can only be expressed if she plays the role of the victim, the shunning endured by Nancy for her lifestyle. Simon's views are progressive for the time. For example, he is aware that it is material need that drives poor women to prostitution, and not a taste for vice. In fact, repressed sexuality is all over this book, which doesn't come as a surprise given the setting, but it is used quite skillfully to demonstrate the various hypocrisies and loopholes of the moral code that people are supposed to adhere to in a puritan society where the realities of having a human body are "distasteful".What bothered me about "Alias Grace" is that Atwood's attempt to inject a little touch of the supernatural in the story felt strained. Grace is remarkable as a narrator, because she is utterly unreliable and mercurial, and there can be many reasons as to why she would lie or pretend to have forgotten some events. There's no one left alive who can corroborate or disclaim anything she says, and women knew that it was better to pretend to be insane and at the very least have a safe enough place to sleep than to be completely sane and destitute. Is she playing a game with the doctor, the matrons and the guards, is she genuinely nuts? Up until the last page, it's impossible to tell. But the hint that something paranormal is going on felt excessive: there's enough weirdness going on with Grace without adding this cherry on the sundae. Did Jeremiah coach her into her little "performance" or was it genuine? Honestly, who cares?! It just feels unnecessary.A solid 4 stars. I look forward to the CBC series that will air in the fall!
2403281094	My, so far, favourite Atwood!Alias Grace is the fictional re-imaging of the historical figure Grace Marks. Grace was just 16 in the year 1843 when she was accused of murdering her employer, Thomas Kinnear, along with his mistress and housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. Grace's regal beauty and tender age redeemed her to the masses and a score of individuals pleaded for her freedom. Grace had little to say for herself, claiming short-term amnesia for the time surrounding the murder. James McDermott was also convicted but, unlike Grace, had no individuals fighting for him, apart from their shared lawyer, and swung for his misdemeanours. Just before he took his final breaths he announced to the crowd that Grace was responsible for Nancy's murder. Instead of following his fate, Grace was incarcerated in an asylum. Whether she was guilty or innocent has never been proven and Grace herself remained reluctant to redeem or condemn herself, continuing to claim a lapse in memory until her eventual death.This fictional account follows Grace's story some years after the chilling ordeal. She is now only temporarily incarcerated at night and spends her days working as a maid in a grand household. Doctor Simon Jordan visits her new abode and, eager to uncover the secrets of this infamous case, sets up a series of meetings in which to explore the past by increasingly peculiar means.Uncovering the mysteries of the past had me as enthralled and captivated as Dr Jordan. Learning the details of this case, through Grace's own words (albeit fictionally), was exhilarating. I appreciated how Atwood provided autonomy to the silenced, historical female and allowed her a space in which to voice her own story.The intrigue continued far beyond the reaches of the page, as Grace's fictional story terminates as mysteriously as her real-world duplicate's. The reader is invited to provide their own closure as no sufficient one is granted, by both Atwood and by history. And so, Grace Marks continues to haunt and to capture the imagination.
167391892	Alias Grace, Margaret Atwood's ninth novel is a work of historical fiction, although based on a true historical event - the story of Grace Marks, a Canadian housemaid who was convicted of murdering her employer Thomas Kinnear, and suspected of murdering his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery on July 23, 1840. The murder has been extensively reported in Canadian, American and British newspapers. It has sparked quite a controversy: Nancy was Kinnear's mistress who has before given birth to an illegitimate child, and at the autopsy she was found to be pregnant again. Grace has immigrated to Canada from Ireland in 1840 when she was 12; her mother has died on the ship carrying the Marks family and was buried at sea, leaving Grace and her younger siblings in care of her father, an abusive alcoholic. She was sentenced for the murders together with James McDermott, one of her fellow servants, as they were caught together during an attempted escape from Canada into the United States; McDermott has been put to death by hanging while Grace has been first sentenced into a confinement in an insane asylum, but later moved to Kingston penitentiary in Ontario, a maximum security prison. She spent almost three decades there before being pardoned; the last information available is that Grace has moved to live in New York. No one knows what became of Grace Marks after that.In the afterwood Atwood points out that while both McDermott and Marks have been condemnded to death for the Kinnear murder, opinions on Grace have been divided from the start; thanks to the efforts of her lawyer and a couple of petitioners her fate has been changed to life imprisonment, from which she has eventually been pardoned. Much ambiguity concerned her case, and opinions on her have been polarized:Attitudes towards her reflected contemporary ambiguity about the nature of women: was Grace a female fiend and temptress, the instigator of the crime and the real murderer of Nancy Montgomery, or was she an unwilling victim, forced to keep silent by McDermott’s threats and by fear for her own life? It was no help that she herself gave three different versions of the Montgomery murder, while James McDermott gave two.The novel is an attempt to explore the ambiguity concerning that murder and the character of Grace Marks, and a very complex and captivating one at that. The novel is told from two perspectives: as a first hand account by Grace, chronicling her life in the penitentiary and remembrances of her past, from her family's arrival in Canada, the struggles and hardships, employment at the Kinnear house and metting with James McDermott.The second narration is in the thirs person, from the perspective of Simon Jordan, a young and ambitious American practictioner of the growing field of psychiatry. As Grace claims to have no memory of the actual murders, he is to reconstruct her case. Slowly he tries to bring Grace closer and closer to the actual event, trying to unlock the mental chest holding the recording of that fateful day.The novel is quite interesting in its structure. Each section begins with an image of a quilt pattern, with additional poetry, citations from newspapers and historical documents, quotations from witnesses, confessions, etc. Grace's monologues are interchanged with Dr. Jordan's correspondence with his friends and family. Even it's generally classified as historical fiction, it has all captivating power of a fine detective thriller, a classic whodunnit, or as in this case shedunnit. Even though the verdict is in and the suspect is in prison, the jury is still much out, and as the pages turn the reader becomes more and more captured by the interplay of Grace's account, which shows her naivete and lack of education, yet reveals an intelligence and cleverness, and Simon's correspondence, research and tries to find the answer to the question which begins to haunt him: who is Grace Marks?Margaret Atwood is without a doubt one of the finest prose stylist, and her unique skill of weaving multiple layers of the story, combined with a vast research of the period she's writing about and relaying them in a rich and lyrical language true to time, place and character is incredible. She is also a poet, and while I have never read her poetry I think that I am not that far away by saying that she is a poet who choses to work with prose from time to time. Simple, everyday things are relayed in a way that immediately captures attention and demands a second look. Consider the opening paragraph:Out of the gravel there are peonies growing. They come up through the loose grey pebbles, their buds testing the air like snails’ eyes, then swelling and opening, huge dark-red flowers all shining and glossy like satin. Then they burst and fall to the ground.Or the opening of chapter 27:Today when I woke up there was a beautiful pink sunrise, with the mist lying over the fields like a white soft cloud of muslin, and the sun shining through the layers of it all blurred and rosy like a peach gently on fire.There is a special quality which few writers posess; the ability to construct a scene, using language which is concise yet elegant, beautiful even, and create an image which stays in the mind, like a burning peach. The novel is worth reading because of the sheer excellence of the language, but together with a skilfully unfolded and unpredictable plot and a rich tapestry of themes it becomes a work which is versatile and more than well worth the invested time.Alias Grace is a beautiful and haunting novel of murder, madness and methodology; it is a fine contribution to the canon of Canadian literature from one of the nation's best known and revered authors. A period piece rich in details of life in the Victorian Canada West, about the importance of class and status, the role of women in the society, the period of history where they were still treated as the feebler sex combined a psychological mystery with all the elements of a great thriller, with excellent characterization and brilliant yet unpretentious language. Even with all its darkness and seriousness of the mystery and situations, Atwood manages to employ humor in the narrative, in a way that is fitting and funny in a good way. It's a spellbinding book that anyone can pick up and become lost in the rich world that it paints, trying to figure out the mystery together with the people that populate it. A great example of combining all the mentioned elements with the the art of exquisite storytelling, Alias Grace is guaranteed to make you think long after the last page has been turned.
5354876063	4.5 StarsThis was such an engrossing piece of crime fiction which is based on an infamous historical murder case in Canada. Margaret Atwood is such a talented author and is solidly earning a spot among my favourites. This is a relatively long novel but I honestly would not cut a sentence. I was gripped from beginning to end. I don't typically read historical fiction but this story appeal to my love of true crime. I appreciate that Atwood pulled in as many details as possible while still often stirring the story into fiction. The most compelling part of the story is the question of Grace's innocence. She is a wonderfully unreliable narrator which a complexity and mystery to the book. The ending is not specifically ambiguous but the narrative continually pulled me in different direction, constantly changing my opinion on our protagonist.I would highly recommend this literary masterpiece to anyone who shares my love of true crime and dark fiction.
2931995418	I adored every single page of this book and I’m truly in awe of Atwood’s skill. She never fails to write an absolutely stunning story that completely draws you in from the very first word. I loved that this was based on historical events but with Atwood’s own spin on it, it is absolutely spectacular. I love how Atwood isn’t afraid to talk about important things and can really make you think while also thoroughly entertaining you. This book is an absolute must read, the story is just so interesting and thrilling, you don’t want to miss out on this one!
4098790190	77th book of 2021.I've always somewhat respected Atwood's presence in the literary world but have been mostly letdown by her work. I can't comment truly on The Handmaid's Tale as I studied it and therefore read it under different circumstances. The Blind Assassin bored me and I clearly didn't see it as the masterpiece everyone else did. I also read Surfacing last year which was well written but ultimately dull and a little aimless. And though she famously said there was nothing in The Handmaid's Tale that hadn't happened somewhere before in history, Alias Grace is a true historical novel centred around a real double-murder in 1843 Canada; and it is now my favourite novel of hers that I've read to date. There's clearly a great degree of artistic license employed by Atwood, but each part opens with real quotations from various confessions and newspaper articles from the real trials. With these novels I always wonder how writers come across them and have conviction that they are essentially bringing something brand new into the world. How did Atwood first stumble across the short 5x5 name Grace Marks? After reading it on other reviews I constantly noticed it myself: the motif of the novel is fragments/patchwork/pieces... It is constructed of pieces: the fiction, the fact, the dreams, the psychology, all woven together. And as the motif, it is appearing constantly. As historical fiction goes, it is up in the top band of what I've read. The writing only dips at times where it drops into using cliched idioms, but perhaps they are conscious choices by Atwood for natural thought/dialogue. It's compelling but drops simply because of Atwood's tiresome over-describing. There's a certain part of the novel that lingers far too long with describing the menial tasks of the time period, how the house is run, how they bathe, how they prepare food, etc. The final few hundred pages are quite brilliant and Simon's perspective chapters are a great. The novel is structured fantastically but Atwood had the greatest hook of all straight from the history itself: did Grace Marks help with the murder and is she insane or not? That's enough to carry almost anyone through the novel, never mind everything else.
2175425554	This is a case of a book with a fascinating premise, solid writing, and great characters that just didn’t quite come together. It’s based on the true story of an Irish-Canadian woman named Grace Marks who was convicted of murder in the 1840s at the age of sixteen. She claims that she has no memory of certain hours on the day of the murders. Fifteen years after Grace is imprisoned, a doctor interested in amnesia and cerebral/nervous illnesses begins to examine her, and together they retread her memories. There are so many interesting thoughts swirling around in here about mental illness, 19th-century asylums, the soul, the subconscious, unintentional vs. selective amnesia, and the blurred lines between truth and lies. But large sections of this book felt unnecessarily prolonged, and it never built to any sort of climax. It just plateaued and then bowed out, and ultimately I didn’t feel like I got much in return for the energy I put in as a reader. Still, it’s an intriguing story that’s told well.

2078633659	“...quando una donna cadeva sulla schiena era come una tartaruga, non riusciva più a rigirarsi per il verso giusto, e chiunque poteva fare quello che voleva.” E’ il 1843 quando il Canada è sconvolto da un efferato fatto di cronaca nera: l’omicidio del ricco possidente Thomas Kinnear e della sua amante, la governante Nancy Montgomery. James McDermott, stalliere e Grace Marks, cameriera vengono incriminati. Da subito la morbosità della gente si infervora per la giovane età di Grace (ha sedici anni) e per la sua bellezza. Due elementi così contrastanti con la scena sanguinosa del crimine.L’opinione pubblica si schiera: Grace Marks è una vittima o un’abile manipolatrice?Margaret Atwood immagina siano passati altri sedici anni dall'arresto quando un giovane psichiatra statunitense, Simon Jordan, chiederà d’incontrarla.E' il 1859, dunque.Cosa ne è stato della ragazzina che ha riempito le pagine dei rotocalchi? Jordan apparentemente sembra mettersi a servizio della causa di coloro che vogliono la scarcerazione della donna, in realtà mira a servirsi della celebrità di questo caso per avviare una brillante carriera.Ottenuta la fiducia, Grace comincia il racconto della sua vita alternato dai pensieri e le considerazioni di Jordan e da un epistolario (molte lettere sono originali) che aiuta a destreggiarsi tra i fatti e le atmosfere dell'epoca. La società nordamericana di fine ottocento è ingabbiata in un rigido pensiero che seppure addolcita dalla missione di carità dei metodisti è fortemente legato ad una lettura sessista e classista.Le donne sono per natura tentatrici e devono essere contenute nelle cuffie e nelle crinoline di fil di ferro:"Sono come gabbie per gli uccelli; ma cos'è che viene rinchiuso dentro? Gambe, le gambe delle signore; gambe chiuse lì perché non possano uscire e strofinarsi contro i pantaloni degli uomini"Sono donne che spesso senza accorgersene mettono in atto la loro liberazione anche solo attraverso il cucito che attraverso i disegni sulle trapunte si esprime con un codice segreto, troneggiando sui letti, luoghi di nascita, di vita e di morte.C'è poi lo studio della mente. Materia non propriamente libera di sondare i territori di ciò che ancora non ha nome, anche in conseguenza al dilagare dei ciarlatani e dello spiritualismo. La psichiatria si doveva, quindi, attenere ad un seminato ben circoscritto e il pensiero dominante non accettava di argomentare su ciò che non era visibile.Una storia che attraversa lo spazio della memoria (“Ci sono sempre pezzi che sembrano appartenere a un piatto completamente diverso; e poi ci sono spazi vuoti, che non riesci a riempire.”) e mira alla vetta della Verità.Emigrata, orfana e abbandonata al suo destino di serva bambina. Chi è Grace Marks?Una storia intrigante finemente maneggiata dalla Atwood che sapientemente sa aggiungere emozioni, colori e odori."Una storia, quando ci sei nel mezzo non è una storia, è solo confusione; un fragore indistinto, un andare alla cieca, tra vetri rotti e schegge di legno; è come una casa che vortica in una tromba d'aria, una nave che si schianta contro gli iceberg o precipita giù per le rapide, e nessuno a bordo può fermarla. È soltanto dopo che diventa una storia, prende una forma. È quando la racconti, a te stessa o a qualcun altro."
2259943640	*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.comMargaret Atwood’s Alias Grace is a novel that provides a recreation of a true event in history, the murder of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper/lover Nancy Montgomery. The shocking part about the double murder of these two souls, is that their sixteen year old housekeeper Grace Marks, along with another employee of Thomas Kinnear’s, James McDermott, were charged with the crime. Atwood’s book begs the reader to consider whether or not Grace could commit this crime. There are plenty of grey areas which the reader is able to play an active role in colouring in.In the year 1843, a young housekeeper by the name of Grace Marks is jailed for killing her employer, Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper/mistress Nancy Montgomery. It almost seems unfathomable that a 16 year old housekeeper could commit such an atrocious crime. With Grace’s conviction comes much doubt. Some people are of the opinion Grace was insane, others hold her completely responsible for the crime, while others believed she may have been manipulated to commit the crime with fellow employee James McDermott. After a stint in mental asylum, Grace is now serving a life sentence for the crimes she has been charged with. Grace appears to have blocked the whole crime from her mind and it is the job of an expert, Doctor Simon Jordan to draw out the truth, in the form of a series of one on one interviews with Grace. Doctor Jordan’s methods are progressive for the time and he experiments with hypnotherapy in an effort to expose the truth once and for all on this crime. It is hoped the Doctor can help Grace gain a pardon, releasing her from the life sentence. When the Doctor comes closer and closer to the truth, what he uncovers is a complex and enthralling case. Can he help draw out the truth and put this crime to rest?I am going to be truthful and admit that I was drawn to this book by the Netflix television series alone. I was intrigued by the series and wanted to discover a little more about this fascinating historical crime, which was what I was hoping to gain from reading the book. The book and the television series do align, I believe Atwood was involved in the screenplay of the series, which is perhaps why it remains true to the book.What the book does offer is a great mix of mediums in presenting this story. Readers of Alias Grace receive a combination of prose styles. These include letters, legal documents, articles, patient notes, poems and Grace’s first hand recount of the events that occurred in her young life, which she relays to Doctor Jordan. In using this style of narration, Atwood keeps the reader on their toes, so that shifting through all the evidence presented becomes an interesting and active experience. I have to admire Atwood’s skill as a storyteller to bring all these aspects of a long lost case together, in the one cohesive tale.Atwood’s historical grounding is remarkable. I enjoyed the experience of being transported to Canada in the 1800’s. I also enjoyed Grace’s thorough recount of her life, which gives the reader a picture of what life was like for those who lived in this era. Atwood charts Grace’s life from the very beginning, starting from her departure from her homeland of Ireland with her family, in search of a better life in Canada. Atwood provides a detailed account on Grace’s traumatic migration by boat to Canada, along with the ill treatment Grace received from her father, through to the places of Grace’s employment and her fateful placement as a servant to Thomas Kinnear. The book also covers Grace’s trial, incarceration and time in the mental asylum. As well as being very moving, there is a great deal of historical accuracy that emanates from the pages of this novel.Atwood matches her well represented historical setting with richly detailed characters. There is Grace Marks, the driving force of the novel, who is deeply intriguing but often appears to be an unreliable narrator. Backing Grace up are a collection of secondary characters that all have firm place in this novel. The most compelling aspect of the characters in this novel is the relationship between Grace and Doctor Simon Jordan.For those who like their novels wrapped up in a neat bow by the end, I would suggest this novel is not for you. This case is overwhelmingly strange and ambiguous. Atwood strives to stick to the facts but in doing so, she does not offers a concrete resolution to Grace’s case. History tells us Grace was pardoned and released, many years after she was first convicted, so perhaps that is your answer. I’m still sitting in the fence with this one and I haven’t made my mind up as to whether Grace truly did commit this crime or what her level of guilt was, if any. I’ll leave it up to you make that judgement if you select this novel to read. I greatly welcome your thoughts on this complex historical case!*Book ‘a’ of the a-z author challenge 2018.

2177816035	Jane Eyre meets Runa. Eine mysteriöse historische Figur namens grace Marks wird hier in einer fiktiven Geschichte aufgearbeitet unter Berücksichtigung der widersprüchlichen Umstände zu ihrer Beteiligung an einem Doppelmord ihrer Arbeitgeber. Die einzigen Kritikpunkte die ich habe sind, das es etwas zu lang war, da in der Mitte etwas zügiger hätte erzählt werden können und Schlussfolgerungen aus ihren Erzählungen und so, wie sie sich Dinge erklärt, zu einfach strukturiert sind für ihre würdevolle, intelligente und ungebrochene Art. Auch nach Beendigung des Buches bin ich nicht schlauer, aber es hat mir gefallen❤️
5524944450	Prima di tutto voglio dire che la Atwood ha una capacità davvero incredibile di farti rimanere incollato alle pagine, la trama scorre benissimo, è molto densa ma si legge con piacere. Che dire di Grace? Un personaggio particolare, a tratti ambiguo sotto certi aspetti. Il sua personalità viene analizzata da molteplici prospettive tutte in ugual modo interessanti. Leggerò sicuramente altro della Atwood :)"A guardare la verità in faccia, ero sola al mondo, senza altre prospettive se non il lavoro ingrato che avevo fatto finora; potevo sempre trovarmi un altro posto, ma il lavoro sarebbe stato lo stesso, dall'alba fino a sera, e sempre con una padrona a darmi ordini."
1780795268	Muy buen libro, y es que Margaret Atwood escribe de maravilla, da gusto leer sus historias.Me ha gustado mucho como está desarrollado el libro, en el que partiendo de un hecho real la autora va construyendo la trama pausada y lentamente, sin aburrir en ningún momento y desarrollando unos personajes maravillosos. Sobre todo el personaje de Grace, tan ambiguo, que hay momentos en los que sientes pena por ella, en otros piensas que está como una cabra y en otros te convences de que es una manipuladora de campeonato. Voy a buscar cosillas por internet, ya que no he querido hacerlo antes por si acaso me destripaban algo.
2304815841	I started reading Atwood nearly two decades ago, after I first encountered THE BLIND ASSASSIN, which instantly became a personal favorite. I have read most of her releases since then, but I never got around to most of her backlist. I think I even picked up ALIAS GRACE but was turned off by its historical setting and epistolary narrative. Now I am kicking myself for waiting so long because I adored this book. This is a long and slow reveal of a book, teasing us with salacious details but only giving us the story after a lengthy wait. We know at the beginning that Grace is accused of murder and the basic outline of what occurred, but we also know that Grace is a mystery, that opinions differ on who she is and what really goes on in her mind. Some believe she is mad, others believe she is murderous, and others all together believe that she is a manipulated innocent. For me, the real pleasure of the book wasn't trying to find out what really happened or whether Grace's story is true. It was seeing the world Grace told through her story, seeing the many ways it could be examined and turned over. And while I have my own preference as to the truth of her story, I am not bound to it. I enjoy considering the other ways it could go. This is a book for readers who enjoy ambiguity.I listened to the audiobook and I particularly enjoyed the narrator's no-nonsense style, it suited Grace and her plain speech. Grace speaks of dress styles, quilt patterns, and stitching. She often spends time in her story talking about the details of laundry or washing. It is perhaps the first time a narrator has ever gotten bogged down in such trivialities without making me even slightly impatient. Grace is building her world for you, one that is so far gone to be foreign, and it is her details that make it come alive and become something you can see and feel and smell. To break up Grace's story and give us a bigger context outside of the small worlds she's inhabited, Atwood also follows Dr. Simon Jordan, whose primary interests are amnesia and the future he imagines for himself where he runs a humane asylum for the mentally unwell. Jordan is able to take the world at his leisure, though he has moved down in the world slightly after his family's financial downturn. He starts out with just a clinical interest in Grace and makes ridiculous attempts to peek into her subconscious memory of the murders. But his interest grows as you'd imagine, when a woman is baring herself to him in words when most women won't even bare an ankle. The lack of sexual freedom is one of the novel's most important themes. But to my surprise it also injects kink and BDSM into the stories, something I don't recall seeing in any novel set in the 19th century that isn't straight up romance. Given the ways Atwood has explored sex and gender dynamics in the past, I probably should have been less surprised.The thing I kept coming back to time and time again was just how much this book is concerned with the way women in Grace's time (and most times) are trapped while men have freedom to move through the world. This is not surprising, and it's common through 19th century fiction, and yet here I felt that confinement so much more acutely than I had before. Perhaps because our story is about Grace, an immigrant and a servant, rather than the kind of middle-class or wealthy woman who usually inhabits these stories. A woman's place is precarious. I found the ending completely satisfying, a rare feat in a book doing this many delicate things at once. Definitely up there with BLIND ASSASSIN and ORYX AND CRAKE, my other two favorite Atwood novels.
2285147113	Μερικές φορές όταν διαβάζω λεπτομερείς περιγραφές σε κάποια βιβλία εκνευρίζομαι. Θέλω να πιάσω τον συγγραφέα και να του ουρλιάξω "να τελειώνει γρήγορα γιατί βαρέθηκα τη ζωή μου με την πολυλογία του, λες και δεν έχουμε τίποτα άλλο να κάνουμε και πρέπει να μάθουμε πόσες πέτρες έχει το δρομάκι που οδηγεί στο σπίτι της πρωταγωνίστριας ΑΝΤΕ ΠΙΑ ΠΡΟΧΩΡΑ ΜΕ ΤΗΝ ΥΠΟΘΕΣΗ" (ή κάτι παρόμοιο τέλος πάντων). Υπάρχουν όμως και κάποιες φορές που όταν μου γράφει ότι η πρωταγωνίστρια "σηκώθηκε τουρτουρίζοντας, φόρεσε τις παντόφλες της, έβαλε τη ρόμπα της, άνοιξε το παντζούρι, κατέβηκε τα σκαλιά για τον κάτω όροφο" και συνεχίζει αναλύοντάς μου με απόλυτη λεπτομέρεια τι ήπιε, τι έφαγε και τι ακριβώς φορούσε, εγώ θέλω να πιάσω τον συγγραφέα και να του ουρλιάξω "Πες μου γρήγορα πόσο κρύο ήταν το νερό που ήπιε και πώς ακριβώς έπιασε τα μαλλιά της, δεν μπορώ θα σκάσω". Δεν ξέρω να πω ποιά είναι η διαφορά ανάμεσα στις τεχνικές γραφής, ξέρω μόνο ότι είναι τόσο σπάνιο να πετύχω συγγραφέα που να μην με κουράζει με τη λεπτομέρεια στις περιγραφές, που όταν τον πετυχαίνω παύω να έχω οποιαδήποτε περιέργεια για την πλοκή και απολαμβάνω απλώς τις περιγραφές. Σε αυτήν την κατηγορία ανήκει το βιβλίο "Το άλλο πρόσωπο της Γκρέις", που ήταν και η πρώτη μου επαφή με την Άτγουντ. Ευχαριστήθηκα λεπτομέρειες για τον ρουχισμό, τα σπίτια, τα έπιπλα, τους τρόπους μετακίνησης, τις δουλειές που έπρεπε να γίνουν από τις γυναίκες (τις υπηρέτριες εν πάση περιπτώση) στον Καναδά της δεκαετίας του 1840. Υπήρχε αναβίωση θα τολμήσω να πω εκείνης της εποχής, με όλες τις διαφορές στις συμπεριφορές αντρών- γυναικών, πλουσίων- φτωχών, αφεντικών- υπηρετών.Αν πρέπει να πω κάτι για την πλοκή θα πω απλά ότι ήταν επαρκής. Η Γκρέις κατηγορείται για συνεργεία σε διπλή δολοφονία και καταδικάζεται σε ισόβια. Υπάρχουν άνθρωποι όμως που πιστεύουν στην αθωότητά της και καλούν τον Σάιμον, έναν γιατρό (ψυχίατρο, πρωτοπόρο για την εποχή του) να την παρακολουθήσει ώστε να συμπεριλάβουν την γνωμοδότησή του στην αίτηση χάριτος της Γκρέις και να την απελευθερώσουν. Μέσα από τις κουβέντες τους μαθαίνουμε για το παρελθόν της Γκρέις, ενώ ταυτόχρονα παρακολουθούμε και τη ζωή του Σάιμον. Ήταν ένοχη για τη δολοφονία η Γκρέις; Ήταν ψυχρή δολοφόνος ή μια άβουλη γυναίκα που την εκμεταλλεύτηκαν; Θα σε αφήσω να σχηματίσεις τη δική σου άποψη...Γενικά να πω ότι αν και από πλοκή το βιβλίο δεν με ενθουσίασε, ήταν τόσες πολλές οι λεπτομέρειες για έναν άγνωστο κόσμο και με κάλυψε τόσο πολύ, που η πλοκή λίγο με ενδιαφέρει. https://kiallovivlio.blogspot.gr/B.R.A.CE.2018: ΄Ένα βιβλίο που είναι εξαντλημένο
2518970231	Atwood nunca falha. Esta é mais uma excelente história, ainda por cima baseada num caso real, contada de forma exímia, com uma enorme inteligência e acutilância. Em quase 500 páginas, senti-me em suspenso, prestes a descobrir algo, tomando mais partido do que devia, vendo-me contrariada uma e outra vez, como verdadeiramente creio que terá acontecido no caso Grace Marks e que acontece tantas vezes perante a invocação da loucura em sede de justiça. Até que ponto a alegada inconsciência da prática de um ato hediondo pode eximir o homicida da culpa? Como se avalia a mente a ponto de decidir pela inimputabilidade, furtando o suposto homicida ao castigo? Estas são matérias fascinantes em que a Medicina se cruza com o Direito e nas quais, ao longo dos séculos, as decisões têm refletido modas, pareceres controvertidos, opiniões públicas diversas e manipuláveis, morais duvidosas e alguma ciência, necessariamente datada.Com este livro aprendi, irritei-me, emocionei-me, deleitei-me. Se não é para isto que serve a literatura, será para quê?
2266426405	Muy buen libro.La historia es sencilla pero la forma en que se narra y los diferentes personajes que intervienen lo convierten en un libro entretenido y emocionante.Con un ritmo pausado y poético y con unos cambios en el punto de vista de la narración que al principio descolocan un poco nos va desgranando la historia de Grace Marks al mismo tiempo que nos describe la sociedad del siglo XIX, con sus clasismos, supersticiones e imposturas.Los personajes secundarios que rodean la historia se vuelven todos insoportables, incluyendo al ,en principio culto y agradable, doctor Simon que resulta ser otro hipócrita más.Respecto a la resolución de la historia, sin desvelar nada, creo que Grace era totalmente culpable aunque probablemente sea la mejor persona que aparece en el libro, y al igual que al "buen" doctor, me produjo una fascinación similar a la que debió de crear a todo el mundo la verdadera Grace.
2773119855	Es la tercera obra que leo de la señora Atwood en los últimos tres años. Ya tengo libro para el año que viene. Uno por año, para no enviciarme.Me esta haciendo dejar de lado a otra gran escritora canadiense, Alice Munro.Alias Grace es una novela con dos grandes personajes. Pasamos de uno a otro para conocer la historia y determinar con nuestro criterio, en base a lo leído si Grace es culpable o no.la historia es real y Atwood se informó y nutrió de distintas fuentes para el presente libro. Está muy interesante buscar como subproducto de la lectura el mesmerismo, la rebelión en Canadá luego de la independencia de los EEUU y la guerra de secesión. Muy disfrutable.

1827875229	I feel a little bad rating this only three stars, but I rate on enjoyment, and Alias Grace took me two months of slogging to finish. Even though it’s a good book and under different circumstances I might have liked it more (and perhaps I will re-read?), I just was not in the mood for reading it. At all. So, three stars.I mean, seriously, it’s not the book’s fault that most serious fiction makes me anxious right now. Or that all I want to do half the time is read fanfiction (I’m not joking when I say I would have at least 26 books completed by now if you replaced all the fanfic I’ve read over the past three weeks with books--I did rough estimates based on word counts). It’s not this book’s fault that all my brain wants is fluff and comfort and brainlessness.Okay, but so, this book: I picked up this book for a reason, actually. I’d only ever read one Margaret Atwood: The Handmaid’s Tale, even if I have read it twice. Well, okay, also her book of poems. But I forget about poetry mostly so I don’t want to count it. I’d never even heard of this book until I heard Netflix would be filming it, and something about it piqued my curiosity and I immediately put it on hold at my library. I read the first fifty or so pages with little trouble, but then I kept just not wanting to read it.I’m not exactly sure what I expected from this book, but it wasn’t what I got.Alias Grace is based on actual events in Canada and Ireland in the 1800s. Grace Marks along with her fellow servant James, murdered their master, Thomas Kinnear and his pregnant housekeeper (who was also his mistress). But Grace has no memory of committing the crime. The novel begins years after the murders have occurred. Grace spends most of her time as a hired out servant from the prison, in the home of the prison governor and his wife, who treat her as a showpiece. The meat of the novel is spent with a young alienist (therapist) who interviews Grace for her version of the story. She ends up telling him about her entire life.There’s lots of stuff crammed in here I’m sure if I’d spent more energy on it, I would have appreciated: Stuff on identity, woman’s place in history, social class . . . but I just couldn’t.I’ll probably end up being the a-hole who likes the TV show better.
177273578	I loved this book. Atwood writes so perfectly that the story could be about nothing at all and I would still continue to read. I had already read the handmaids tale several years ago and thought it was great but I preferred Alias Grace just for the style of writing. This book has made me want to read all Atwood's books.
5733251706	Пристъпих с огромно притеснение към първите страници от тази книга. Първата ми среща с Атууд беше абсолютно неуспешна. Ако не бяха многото любими четящи приятели край мен, които обичат авторката надали щях да посегна втори път към нейна книга.Да си призная още съм със смесени чувства и определено трябва да прочета още нещо, за да имам твърдо мнение по темата харесвам или не Маргарет Атууд. Страшно много ми допадна образа на Грейс - за мен Атууд се е справила блестящо в изграждането му и представянето на вътрешния свят и монолог на героинята. Взела е една реална случка и я превърнала във фикционален роман, който непрекъснато те кара да се чудиш кое е истина и кое не. През цялото време емпатизирах на Грейс и дълбоко и убедено вярвах в нейната невинност.“Убийца, убийца”, шепне си той. В това има някакво очарование, едва ли не аромат. На парникови гардении. Привлекателни, но и измамни. Представя си как вдъхва уханието им, докато придърпва Грейс към себе си и притиска устни към нейните. “Убийца!” С тази дума дамгосва шията и.”Стила на писане е неподражаем - наистина не мога да го оприлича на никой друг автор, който съм чела. Имаше нещо много особено в тази книга и ми е адски трудно да обясня какво. Описанията са толкова ярки, че ме пренесоха във времето, в което се развива действието съвсем успешно. Бях в трюма на кораба с Грейс, в малката стаичка в затвора с нея, в имението на Киниър. Едновременно с това от суровата обстановка ме побиваха тръпки не веднъж изпитах силно отвращение, докато четях конкретни епизоди.
3841402084	Non è la prima volta che leggo un libro di Atwood e benché ne abbia sempre riconosciuto l’indubbio talento di scrittrice, le sue storie non mi avevano mai catturato… fino ad ora.Sebbene questo libro sia un'opera di finzione, è basata su eventi reali. La protagonista, Grace Marks, condannata giovanissima a sedici anni per l’omicidio del suo datore di lavoro e della sua governante, fu una delle donne più note e chiacchierate del Canada verso la metà dell’800. La personalità della vera Grace Marks rimane tutt’ora un mistero, così come la sua storia vera.La Grace della Atwood è un personaggio indimenticabile, misterioso e molto complesso, che ti rimane nella mente come un’amica che ha saputo farsi spazio in punta di piedi nei tuoi pensieri. Vittima o carnefice? Pazza o furba? Innocente o peccatrice?Ognuno troverà la sua risposta in questa storia intensa, truce e dignitosa al tempo stesso.Un libro che merita davvero di essere letto.
7515912019	Wrapping up a Canada-infused reading month with the materfamilias of Canadian letters. Alias Grace is a masterful work of historical fiction that boasts the richness of detail, vivid and beguiling cast of characters, light playfulness of form, and consummate skill for bold big-canvas storytelling that puts her on a par with the likes of Eliot or Dickens. Enough said.
2739782110	Η Μάργκαρετ Άτγουντ αποτελεί ένα σημαντικό κεφάλαιο στο παγκόσμιο λογοτεχνικό στερέωμα. Με την διορατικότητα, την οξυδέρκεια και την αφηγηματική δεινότητα που την διέπουν ως συγγραφέα, έχει καταφέρει να παραμείνει μέχρι και σήμερα όχι μόνο ενεργή και δραστήρια όσον αφορά την συγγραφική παραγωγή, αλλά και στην πρώτη γραμμή των συγγραφέων – λογοτεχνών με διαχρονικό χαρακτήρα, που καταφέρνουν να εναρμονίζονται με την εποχή, και να μιλούν εύστοχα γι' αυτήν μέσα απ' το έργο τους.Αφορμή του παρόντος κειμένου συνίσταται η ανάγνωση του μυθιστορήματος Η ΑΛΛΗ ΓΚΡΕΪΣ που αποτελεί επανέκδοση του μυθιστορήματος ΤΟ ΑΛΛΟ ΠΡΟΣΩΠΟ ΤΗΣ ΓΚΡΕΪΣ που είχε κυκλοφορήσει παλαιότερα απ' την ασημένια σειρά των εκδόσεων Ωκεανίδα. Την εξαιρετική μετάφραση της νέας έκδοσης του βιβλίου υπογράφει ο συγγραφέας-μεταφραστής Αύγουστος Κορτώ, ενώ το μυθιστόρημα κυκλοφορεί πλέον από τις εκδόσεις Ψυχογιός.Βασισμένη σε πραγματικά γεγονότα, η Καναδή συγγραφέας θεμελιώνει ένα αμιγώς κοινωνικό μυθιστόρημα με πολιτικές προεκτάσεις. Πρόκειται ωστόσο για ένα μυθιστόρημα εντός του οποίου εντοπίζουμε και κάποια αμυδρά ίσως στοιχεία του αστυνομικού μυθιστορηματικού είδους, καθώς και στοιχεία των μυθιστορημάτων εποχής, κι αυτό γιατί η Μάργκαρετ Άτγουντ μέσα απ' την ιστορία που επιλέγει να μας αφηγηθεί αναπαριστά με περισσή γλαφυρότητα τις αμερικανικές κοινωνίες του 19ου αιώνα. Κεντρικό πρόσωπο του μυθιστορήματος αποτελεί η τρόφιμος φυλακής Γκρέις Μαρκς, που εμφανίζει κενά μνήμης και είχε υπάρξει στο παρελθόν υπηρέτρια αξιομνημόνευτης ομορφιάς, η οποία κατηγορήθηκε στα δεκαέξι της, ως συνεργός για την διπλή ανθρωποκτονία του αφεντικού της και της οικονόμου του σπιτιού του. Για τον λόγο αυτό, η Γκρέις καταδικάστηκε σε θάνατο, ποινή ωστόσο που δεν εφαρμόστηκε ποτέ, μιας και γρήγορα μετατράπηκε σε ισόβια κάθειρξη.Ο αναγνώστης συναντά την Γκρέις Μαρκς στο σπίτι του διευθυντή των φυλακών, όπου τα πρωινά προσφέρει εθελοντική εργασία ως υπηρέτρια, με αφορμή την επίσκεψη του γιατρού Τζόρνταν, ο οποίος σε μία εποχή που η ιατρική και ειδικότερα η ειδικότητα της ψυχιατρικής κάνει δειλά τα πρώτα της βήματα, εξερευνά τις ποικίλες εκφάνσεις των ψυχικών ασθενειών. Μέσα λοιπόν απ' την καθημερινή, πρόσωπο με πρόσωπο επικοινωνία της Γκρέις με τον γιατρό Τζόρνταν γινόμαστε κοινωνοί των εξομολογήσεων της. Εξομολογήσεις που μας περιγράφουν την καθημερινότητα της Γκρέις κατά τη διάρκεια των χρόνων που προσέφερε τις υπηρεσίες της ως οικιακή βοηθός, αλλά και των τριάντα εκείνων χρόνων του εγκλεισμού της στη φυλακή και στα φρενοκομεία, στα οποία νοσηλεύτηκε.Η Καναδή συγγραφέας στηρίζοντας τον μύθο της σε πηγές της εποχής, οι οποίες σποραδικά αναφέρονται μες στις σελίδες του βιβλίου, δημιουργεί δύο κύριους αφηγηματικούς άξονες, που ξεδιπλώνουν σταδιακά την ιστορία της. Χρησιμοποιώντας την πρωτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση η Άτγουντ δίνει φωνή στην αινιγματική και αμφιλεγόμενη ως προς το ποιόν του χαρακτήρα της, κεντρική ηρωίδα του βιβλίου, την Γκρέις, την οποία θα μπορούσαμε να χαρακτηρίσουμε και ως αναξιόπιστο αφηγητή. Παράλληλα, η Άτγουντ χρησιμοποιεί και την τριτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση ώστε να αποστασιοποιηθεί απ' την ηρωίδα της και να μας την περιγράψει μέσα απ' την ματιά ενός τρίτου, και στην προκείμενη περίπτωση, μέσα απ' τα μάτια του γιατρού Τζόρνταν. Κοινό στοιχείο που εντοπίζει κανείς και στους δύο αφηγηματικούς άξονες της συγγραφέως, είναι η εικονοπλαστικότητα που διέπει την γραφή της. Η συγγραφέας με άκρως παραστατικό και λεπτομερή τρόπο δημιουργεί απολαυστικές, ακριβείς περιγραφές, που μπορεί να είναι εκτενείς, αλλά δεν κουράζουν και δεν εμποδίζουν την ροή του μυθιστορήματος, που παρότι κυλά αργά, καταφέρνει να αιχμαλωτίσει τον αναγνώστη στα δίχτυα της, κι αυτό ίσως οφείλεται στο μυστήριο που κυριαρχεί γύρω απ' το όνομα της Γκρέις Μάρκς.Η ιστορία της Γκρέις αποτελεί για την Μάργκαρετ Άτγουντ μίας πρώτης τάξεως ευκαιρία για να τοποθετήσει στο μικροσκόπιο της τις κοινωνίες του 19ου αιώνα και μέσω της ηρωίδας της να ασκήσει κριτική, με τρόπο λεπτό και ειρωνικό, ευδιάκριτο μονάχα απ' τα μάτια ενός πεπειραμένου αναγνώστη, στην πατριαρχία και στις κοινωνίες που έχουν οικοδομηθεί επάνω της. Η Άτγουντ ουσιαστικά μέσω της Γκρέις προσπαθεί να μας δείξει πόσο υποβιβασμένη ήταν κάποτε κοινωνικά η γυναίκα, η οποία εγκλωβισμένη σε μία πληθώρα “πρέπει”, “μη” κι απαγορεύσεων, διαδραμάτιζε συγκεκριμένους ρόλους στην καθημερινότητα της, ρόλους με αμέτρητους περιορισμούς, ζώντας πάντα στη σκιά των ανδρών. Ο τρόπος με τον οποίο οι πατριαρχικά διαμορφωμένες κοινωνίες της εποχής αντιμετώπιζαν τις γυναίκες, καθρεφτίζεται ξεκάθαρα στη στάση και στον τρόπο με τον οποίο αντιμετωπίστηκε η Γκρέις τόσο από τις αρχές, όσο και από τους υπεύθυνους της φυλακής και τους διάφορους γιατρούς που συνάντησε στα φρενοκομεία που νοσηλεύτηκε. Θαυμαστή ήταν η γενναία στάση της πρωταγωνίστριας έναντι όλων των εξωγενών αυτών παραγόντων, που θα έπαιζαν καθοριστικό ρόλο στο αν τελικά θα κατάφερνε να παραμείνει στη ζωή!Διαβάζοντας, λοιπόν, το μυθιστόρημα της Άτγουντ μπορώ να πω ότι συμπάθησα και συμπόνεσα ειλικρινά την ηρωίδα της, παρότι η ενοχή της παραμένει ένα άλυτο μυστήριο μέχρι και το τέλος του βιβλίου. Αυτό συνέβη κυρίως γιατί η συγγραφέας μας μετέτρεψε σε μάρτυρες της καθημερινότητας της Γκρέις από την παιδική της ακόμη ηλικία, όπου βίωσε τη βία, μεγαλώνοντας πλάι σε έναν σκληρό και αλκοολικό πατέρα, αλλά και των επόμενων χρόνων της ζωής της, τόσο ως υπηρέτρια, όσο κι ως φυλακισμένη, κατά τη διάρκεια των οποίων υπήρξε βορά του πατριαρχικού κοινωνικού της περιβάλλοντος, κι έρμαιο του κοινωνικού κατεστημένου, απ' το οποίο έπαιρνε ως ανατροφοδότηση μονάχα αμφισβήτηση και απαξίωση.​Ολοκληρώνοντας, νομίζω πως τα λόγια περισσεύουν κάθε φορά που πρόκειται να μιλήσω ή πιο ορθά να γράψω για κάποιο απ' τα μυθιστορήματα της Μάργκαρετ Άτγουντ. Πρόκειται για μία συγγραφέα που πάντα έχει κάτι να πει μέσα από τα γραφόμενα της στον αναγνώστη. Δεν θα πρωτοτυπήσω λέγοντας πως και το μυθιστόρημα Η ΑΛΛΗ ΓΚΡΕΪΣ είναι ένα βιβλίο που αξίζει να διαβάσετε γιατί θα αποτελέσει έναυσμα για πολλές σκέψεις και προβληματισμούς σχετικά με την κατάχρηση εξουσίας από την πλευρά των ανδρών έναντι των γυναικών, καθώς και για την ταξική και έμφυλη βία που καλούνταν κάποτε να αντιμετωπίσουν οι γυναίκες, όντας μέλη πατριαρχικών κοινωνιών.

351324451	Take a sensational event. Gather all information available about it, credible or not (testimonies, newspaper articles, letters etc.). Fill in the gaps with your own imagination. Carefully delete any border between reality and fiction. Here it is: the perfect recipe for a postmodernist novel. And what a novel! As usual, Margaret Atwood creates a "oeuvre d'art". The story of Grace Marks, a "celebrated Canadian murderer" of the 19th century, is retold in a ludic manner, enriched with unexpected meanings and robbed of all her "real" reality to be invested with a whole "fictive" reality. Do you get now the "alias" in the title? Of course, the surprising adjective stands also for the subtle transformation of "grace" into a commun noun, and for many other meanings, yours to discover.I think the theme of this extraordinary novel is the destiny, viewed like, why not, a quilt pattern, to decipher before assembling. This becomes evident as soon as you understand Mary Whitney's death story as a "mise en abyme" which foresees Nancy and her lover's deaths. Almost the same story (the love between the gentleman and the servant gone bad), but with different consequences and a somehow better served justice. Because Grace identifies herself with Mary (another explanation for "alias"), and avenges her but saves herself by putting her actions in Mary's hands (as in she doesn't remember, she has black-outs, she was possessed by Mary's vengeful spirit as revealed in the seance of hypnotism organized by the impostor Jeremiah the Peddler). And this is only one interpretation of this peculiar story centered apparently around one big question: "Is Grace guilty or not?" No one is able to discover the answer, not Simon the doctor who interviews her to better understand the mind's mechanics, not her lawyer, not the hospice doctor, not the reverend who writes petition after petition for her pardon, and of course Grace herself never explains, only tells some parts of the truth. Like a quilt (the leitmotive of the novel) with too many different patterns, the truth is hidden under too many variants.But is the answer to the guilt question important? For real justice it certainly was. For literature, not as important as the strong character created by a skilful writer from small details, from many voices and little action. And this is, finally the main quilt pattern to discover.
989253273	Another wonderful read from Margaret Atwood. I went into this book blind, not knowing this is Atwood's re-creation of an actual event that took place in the mid 1800's. The amount of research and location of records must have been extremely difficult. I think knowing this from the outset would have made a difference in my experience of this book. While it keep me fully engaged throughout, I found it a little slow and overly descriptive at times. Becoming aware that this was an actual event, I find it to be a masterpiece in it's ability to revive the past.This is the story of Grace, who uses an alias name after she is accused of a horrible murder. The insights into how women were regarded in this time period are always highly disturbing. Her every move is defined in relation to what males think. Atwood did an amazing job leading me through the murders and evidence against Grace. It is a sad state of affairs when men have all the power and their accusations always prevail. It left me wondering just how far Grace had to go to protect herself. Atwood, in the end, leaves us to decide for ourselves what really took place. She also shows how limited any real choice was for a woman in that time period. In fact, I would say they were non-existent, leaving me to not only take a hard look at how long women have struggled to obtain them, but also at how these choices are slowly being stripped away in current times.
2778916919	Πρώτη φορά που διάβασα Ατγουντ αλλά σίγουρα όχι τελευταία. Η ιστορία της νεαρής υπηρέτριας Γκρέις που εκτυλίσσεται στο 19ο αιώνα παρά το γεγονός ότι δεν είχε έντονη πλοκή κράτησε αμείωτο το ενδιαφέρον μου μέχρι το τέλος. Η γραφή της Ατγουντ πολύ δυνατή με αφήγηση που εναλλάσσεται σε πρωτοπροσωπη όταν μιλάει η ηρωίδα και τριτοπρόσωπη όταν η συγγραφέας θέλει να αποστασιοποιηθεί από τα γεγονότα. Η γλώσσα διατηρεί τους τύπους του 19ου αιώνα και αυτό δεν χάνεται στη μετάφραση, καθώς ο Κορτώ κατάφερε να αποδώσει με αριστοτεχνικό τρόπο τη μετάφραση. Εκτός από τη βασική ιστορία που αναφέρεται στην καταδίκη της νεαρής υπηρέτριας και στο κατά ποσό αληθεύει η εμπλοκή της ή όχι στους φόνους για τους οποίους κατηγορείται, προβάλλονται και αλλά ζητήματα. Η θέση της γυναίκας και ο τρόπος με τον οποίο αντιμετωπιζόταν από τον άνδρα τον 19ο αιώνα είναι ένα από αυτά τα θέματα. Επίσης ιδιαιτερη σημασια δίνεται στο θεμα της θρησκείας καθως και των ψυχικών ασθενειών.
4332452929	Ver uma série na TV é como observar a beleza de uma laranja. Ler o livro é descascar essa laranja e ter o prazer de saborear lentamente os seus gomos e deliciarmo-nos com o seu sumo.É assim a escrita da Margaret Atwood.E este livro é FABULOSO!
1965480842	Ήθελα πάρα πολύ καιρό να διαβάσω αυτό το βιβλίο και την Πορφυρή Δούλη της ίδιας αλλά αποφάσισα να ξεκινήσω με τούτο εδώ. Έχοντας διαβάσει τα Έθιμα Ταφής - ένα βιβλίο που θεωρούσα εξαρχής ότι είναι το παρόμοιο - ήθελα να δω πως θα χειριστεί ένα παρόμοιο θέμα η αγαπημένη Καναδή συγγραφέας και μπορώ ήδη να σας πω πως δεν με κέρδισε.Αποφάσισα να διαβάσω την ελληνική μετάφραση αν και από ότι είδα μετά το πέρας της ανάγνωσης η αγγλική ήταν σαφώς καλύτερη. Η μεταφράστρια δεν κατάφερε να μεταφέρει την λυρικότητα που βρήκα στον αγγλικό κείμενο και αυτό ήταν κάτι που έλειπε απο την μετάφραση. Αγαπώ να διαβάζω για παλιές εποχές γιατί μαθαίνω πολλά για την τότε περίοδο, τα ήθη και τα έθιμα όχι μόνο περασμένων χρόνων αλλά και άλλων πολιτισμών και μέσα από την ιστορία αυτή μαθαίνουμε πολλά. Ένα μεγάλο κομμάτι της ιστορίας είναι διακριτικά αφιερωμένο στο να μας δώσει μια σαφή εικόνα για την ζωή που είχαν να αντιμετωπίσουν οι φτωχοί μετανάστες που έφυγαν από την πεινασμένη Ιρλανδία προς τον Καναδά και συγκεκριμένα τα προβλήματα που έπεφταν στις ποδιές νεαρών κοριτσιών που δούλευαν σαν υπηρέτριες σε σπίτια. Κάπως έτσι έφτασε και η Γκρέις, η ηρωίδα μας, να δουλεύει στο σπίτι του ανθρώπου που θα την κατηγορούσαν για την δολοφονία του.Την Γκρέις την βρήκα, λυπάμαι που θα το πω, κάπως αδιάφορη. Ήταν σαν να βρισκόταν στο background και να μας εξιστορούσε μια ιστορία που δεν είχε εκείνη σαν κεντρική ηρωίδα αλλά όλους τους άλλους που έτυχε να γνωρίσει στην ζωή της. Παρόλα αυτά ήταν συμπαθητική σαν φωνή και δεν μου γέννησε κάποιο αρνητικό συναίσθημα. Την λυπόμουν σε σημεία και σε άλλα την χαιρόμουν αλλά ποτέ δεν την αγάπησα. Παρέα με την Γκρέις στην εξιστόρηση ήταν και ο γιατρός Τζόρνταν ο άνθρωπος που έβαλε σκοπό να ανοίξει το μυαλό της Γκρέις και να ανασύρει τις μνήμες που είχε κλειδωμένες εκεί μέσα Αυτόν τον συμπάθησα. Μου φάνηκε πιο συμπαθής, πιο ενδιαφέρον. Αν και ηθικά ήταν πιο τραυματισμένος από την Γκρέις, εμένα με έκανε να τον συμπαθήσω πιο πολύ.Αν υπάρχει κάτι που μου κάνει φοβερή εντύπωση σε τέτοιου είδους βιβλία είναι η θέση της γυναίκας στην κοινωνία και το πως αντιμετωπίζεται η μοναδικότητα ανάμεσα στις γυναίκες. Η Γκρέις σαν εγκληματίας αντιμετωπιζόταν διαφορετικά από έναν αρσενικό εγκληματία, η φύση της βαφόταν με πιο δαιμονικά χρώματα, έπαιρνε πιο σατανική υπόσταση. Ο τρόπος που την αντιμετώπιζαν οι φύλακες, οι γιατροί και γενικά η εξουσία ήταν συχνά σοκαριστικός. Δεν μου έκανε καθόλου εντύπωση που αναθεωρήθηκε ο τρόπος που δούλευαν οι φυλακές και τα δικαστήρια. Και πρέπει φυσικά να παραδεχτώ την ηρωίδα μας για τον τρόπο που επιβίωσε μέσα σε τόσο αντίξοες συνθήκες. Όσον αφορά το τέλος- σίγουρα με άφησε με πολλά ερωτήματα!Δεν θεωρώ ότι πήρα από το βιβλίο αυτό που θα ήθελα, δεν ένιωσα θλίψη ή κάποιο άλλο δυνατό συναίσθημα. Η ανάγνωση προχωρούσε μηχανικά, απλά και μόνο για να δω που θα οδηγήσει η συγγραφέας την ιστορία. Παρόλα αυτά αναγνωρίζω πως συχνά είμαι το "μαύρο πρόβατο" των κριτικών για αυτό και το προτείνω διότι ξέρω πως θα βρει αναγνώστες που θα το αγαπήσουν.

1731978350	“To go from a familiar thing, however undesirable, into the unknown, is always a matter for apprehension, and I suppose that is why so many people are afraid to die.” Margaret Atwood is the author that I absolutely love and yet somehow never managed to read enough of her work. I started with The Handmaid’s Tale and than the MaddAdam trilogy and I absolutely adored them both. Yet it’s been almost exactly a year since I last put my hand on a book by her, and now that I’ve finished Alias Grace I’m even more upset with myself for that.I don’t want to venture too far and make statements such as naming Alias Grace the best Margaret Atwood book that I have read but I will say that it was just as good, while also being better in certain regards. I’m so used with reading speculative fiction from Margaret that I was expecting an historical book by her too feel different, but somehow it didn’t, it felt familiar but in a good way. I feel that with Margaret Atwood the writing is always going to be brilliant, but Alias Grace stood out to me because of the way the author used a historic persona as tool to analyze society and what it meant to live as a free woman (as free as they could be during that period) and as a woman behind bars. Despite Grace being the main character, the author never takes sides, Grace as a character is a mystery and even when you think that you have everything figured out, you end up realizing that you know nothing. But in the end, what I liked the most about this book is Grace. Grace as a character, hearing her thoughts, her comments and just reading about her past, present and future. Margaret Atwood has created a character that will forever hold a special place in my heart.
5868331916	Много ми е трудно да дам оценка на тази книга на Атууд, може би защото вече силно съм повлияна от други нейни творби. Със сигурност книгата ми хареса, имаше всички типични за нея похвати – богатия, но същевременно с това пестелив език, характерните за нея описания на места и предмети по начини, които никога не бих си помислила за възможни (напр. канапе с цвят на език) и, разбира се, пълното уважение на мнението на читателя и даването на възможност той сам да разгадае историята е да вземе решение за правотата на казаното. Ще мисля много за тази книга в следващите дни, а може би и седмици, но засега ѝ забивам стабилни 3.5 звезди. Ето и малко разкош от баба ви Атууд:Не си е работа да се омъжиш за някого, дето не го обичаш, ама мнозина го правят и свикват с времето. Други пък се омъжват по любов и после цял живот съжаляват за това.Да си недоучен е опасно нещо.Едва по-късно се замислих как ми го беше казала. Осигурен ти е хубав дом, както се говори за куче или кон, който е вече твърде стар за работа и никой не иска да го държи, ала и не му дава сърце да се отърве от него.
1044458907	This is an intriguing story that Margaret Atwood has creatively re-woven from a true murder case that took place in the 1800s in the suburbs of Toronto, Canada. It is written from the perspectives of the imprisoned murderess and of the mental illness physician who was hired, sixteen years after her conviction, by campaigners for her release, to study her mental state prevalent at the time of the perpetration of the crime.Interlaced with the enthralling narrative is the author’s insight into the deep social conflict between the affluent and the underclass (consisting mostly of poor immigrants) of the time, and the convoluted men-and-women relationships and the tension they lend to their daily lives. That insight is sometimes tempered with a sense of dry humor.Overall, the novel has great drawing power, and it leaves the reader pondering over the innocence or otherwise of the protagonist and whether or not to feel empathy with her.The style of writing is fluid and evocative of a past era and its attendant moral attitudes.
3849384040	This was my first of Atwood’s works to read, and I was mesmerized by it. The depth of character, as well as the raw humanity shown throughout the whole of the story was breathtaking. I couldn’t put it down. Five stars.
2500373819	4.5 stars. Based on a real life murder in the 18th century, this is an intriguing story very well told. This is my second book by Atwood and I am looking forward to reading more of her work.

3661472386	Είναι δύσκολο να αποφασίσεις πως αισθάνθηκες και τι ένιωσες γι’αυτή την ιστορία, ίσως αυτός να είναι και ο σκοπός της Άτγουντ. Είναι μια βαθιά και παράξενη υπόθεση βασισμένη σε αληθινά γεγονότα και πατάει στα σκοτάδια της ψυχής των ανθρώπων που έχει βιαστεί ο εσωτερικός τους συνειδητός εαυτός, τα τραγικά γεγονότα θάβονται στο ασυνείδητο και δείχνουν να ξεχνιούνται, μα είναι μόνο μια χρονική περίοδος ανάπαυλας, ένας βαθύς ύπνος που κοιμίζει την αρρωστημένη από τα γεγονότα ψυχολογία και χρειάζεται μια απρόσμενη συστροφή του μυαλού, μια λεπτομέρεια, που ενεργοποιεί μνήμες και αισθήσεις, για να ξυπνήσει τα καταραμένα ιερά τέρατα της ενοχής και του συνειδησιακού πένθους. Η δημιουργική ,σχεδόν, μυθοπλασία της Άτγουντ δεν απογοητεύει εύκολα ακόμη και τα πιο απαιτητικά αναγνωστικά γούστα. Το συναρπαστικό χαρακτηριστικό της γραφής της είναι το απροσδόκητο επίπεδο βάθους στις ανθρώπινες ψυχογραφίες και η πολυπλοκότητα των εξελίξεων σε παρόν και παρελθόν. Υπάρχουν πολλές στιγμές που δεν ξέρεις αν πρέπει να εμπιστευτείς έναν αναξιόπιστο αφηγητή μιας συναρπαστικής ιστορίας με πολλαπλές ανεξήγητες απολήξεις. Σε αυτό το βιβλίο η καθημερινή ζωή του Καναδά τον 19ο αιώνα ζωντανεύει με μία ιστορία που παρουσιάζεται εντέχνως ως ιστορική μυθοπλασία και μυστήριο δολοφονίας. Διακειμενικότητα με κάποια αμφισβήτηση , κομμάτια ποίησης , σελίδες απο γράμματα και αποσπάσματα απο βιβλία συντροφεύουν την κομματιασμένη δικαστική έρευνα και την αποσπασματική δικογραφία. Η Γκρέις ήταν πραγματικό άτομο και η γραφή της Άτγουντ βασίστηκε σε αληθινά γεγονότα. Όσο επίπεδος και άχρωμος χτίστηκε ο χαρακτήρας της τόσο επηρεασμένη τραγικά, διπολική, σχιζοφρενική προσωπικότητα με την εμφάνιση και την προϋπάρχουσα επιρροή της «Χάριτος» σε όποιο επίπεδο πίστης και κατανόησης και ψυχικής εμβάθυνσης μπορεί να αξιολογηθεί. Όταν η Γκρέις αφηγείται την πλευρά της ιστορίας στον νεαρό Dr. Simon Jordan υπεισέρχεται έστω και μυθικοπλαατικά η πολύσημη και πολυδιάστατη ενέργεια της «Χάριτος». Ο Δρ. Ιορδάνης έχει εγκαταλείψει μια παραδοσιακή ιατρική πρακτική και είναι υπέρμαχος της μελέτης του νου και των ψυχικών ασθενειών. Ως πρόδρομος του πεδίου της ψυχιατρικής επιδιώκει να αποδείξει την αθωότητα της Γκρέις αποκαλύπτοντας την αλήθεια των γεγονότων, καθώς και την ψυχική κατάσταση της. Είναι αυτονόητο ότι τον 19ο αιώνα, η πλειονότητα των ψυχικών ασθενειών δεν «ανακαλύφθηκε», ερευνήθηκε και διαγνώστηκε - έτσι, το ψυχικά άρρωστο άτομο πιθανότατα θα ήταν κλειδωμένο σε μπουντρούμια, φυλακισμένο και ξεχασμένο ή θα έχριζε θρησκευτικής θεραπείας μέσα απο εξορκισμούς και τρομερές δεισιδαιμονίες. Εν κατακλείδι το κύριο θέμα της Atwood φαίνεται να είναι ένα καυστικό σχολαστικά επηρεασμένο συμβάν κοινής λογικής στις προκαθορισμένες αντιλήψεις της κοινωνίας για τις γυναίκες, ειδικά εκείνες που φυλακίστηκαν για εγκλήματα ή αρρωστημένα αμαρτήματα: εάν μια γυναίκα είναι νέα και όμορφη, οι άνθρωποι φαίνονται διατεθειμένοι να πιστέψουν την αθωότητά της; Ίσως. Και αν μια γυναίκα είναι ηλικιωμένη και άσχημη, την κάνει αυτό αυτομάτως ένοχη; Οι απόψεις διίστανται. Ταυτόχρονα, μπορεί η κοινωνία να δεχτεί μια νεαρή και όμορφη γυναίκα ως άκακη και αθώα για να χειριστεί τους ανθρώπους να πιστέψουν σε επίπλαστες εξομολογήσεις ενώ τελικά έκανε το έγκλημα; Απειλείται η κοινωνία από μια έξυπνη γυναίκα, τελείως, και θα ήταν εγγενώς ύποπτες γι 'αυτήν εξαιτίας αυτού του χαρακτηριστικού; Εάν η Γκρέις δεν ήταν τόσο νεαρή και όμορφη, θα της είχε επιβληθεί ισόβια κάθειρξη; Ίσως αν ήταν άσχημη θα είχε κρεμαστεί, επειδή η κοινωνία είναι ικανή να μεταχειρίζεται τις γυναίκες που δεν συμμορφώνονται με τα παραδοσιακά πρότυπα ομορφιάς. Αν ο Τζέιμς Μακ Ντέρμοτ δεν συμμετείχε καθόλου, θα μπορούσε η κοινωνία να είχε αποδεχτεί ότι η Χάρη μπορεί να τα έκανε όλα μόνη της; Εάν ο Τζέιμς Μακ Ντέρμοτ δεν συμμετείχε, θα μπορούσε η κοινωνία να πιστεύει ότι η Γκρέις είναι μια χειραγωγημένη πόρνη ή ένα χαντακωμένο απο τη μοίρα κορίτσι που αγαπάει; Femme fatale ή αθώο κορίτσι; Όλα υποθετικά και ανυπέρβλητο αμφισβητήσιμο. Αυτοί οι δύο ρόλοι διαιωνίζονται συχνά όχι μόνο στα μέσα μαζικής ενημέρωσης, αλλά και στην κοινωνία μας στο σύνολό της. Η γυναίκα,,μπορεί να είναι τίποτα άλλο από ένα από αυτά τα δύο αρχέτυπα, μόνο, και τίποτα περισσότερο.Πιθανότατα και δεν θα μάθουμε ποτέ την αλήθεια για τη Grace Marks, αλλά το μυθιστόρημα της Atwood εφιστά την προσοχή σε ζητήματα που εξακολουθούν να είναι διαχρονικά . Το πώς βλέπουμε την Γκρέις θα αντικατοπτρίζει αναπόφευκτα τη δική μας κοσμοθεωρία, όπως ήταν κατά τη στιγμή της δίκης της. Οι άνθρωποι θα πιστεύουν πάντα αυτό που θέλουν να πιστέψουν, ανεξάρτητα από την αλήθεια. Διότι νιώθουμε αυτό που νομίζουμε πως νιώθουμε χωρίς παράπλευρες απώλειες ή επιφυλάξεις ακόμη και στην ποινική υποψία ενοχοποίησης ή παραινετικής πλάνης λόγω άποψης ατομικών αξιών και προσωπικών δεδομένων. Καλή ανάγνωση. Πολλούς ασπασμούς.
