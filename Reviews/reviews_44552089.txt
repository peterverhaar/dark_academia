2751281390	“The realization that everyone right now is probably throbbing with the need to come shivers over me, and I have a brief fantasy of all of them—every last one of them—using my body to sate themselves with. My mouth and my tight cunt and everything, until every last person is spent and loose.” Ms. Simone, you filthy, dirty, brilliant woman... _______________ After several cold showers... I don't really know where to even begin with this beautifully screwed up story. This was so enrapturing and stunningly sexy, to the point where I can't even begin to tell you what it's about. *sigh* I didn't know the premise of the story when I started and I enjoyed it even more because of it. Just trust that you should go into this blind, and open your mind to all the foul and dirty creations that Sierra Simone very magically devises. There are certain trigger warnings that the author posted during the cover reveal that is perhaps all you need to know: "CONTENT WARNING: pretty boys pouting and staring at the rain, old library filled to the brim with moldering manuscripts full of secrets, aggressively bisexual, ritual deflowering of virgins, kink, angst, blood, jealousy, archival minutiae, Latin words, tragic backstories, murder, Prosecco, and a dog"But if you're like me, those would have only intrigued you even further. As soon as I started reading this, the atmosphere was enchanting. It almost felt like there was a sense of magical element, a paranormal asset to the setting. Thornchapel is a place, but also a feeling and you can really understand it through the writing. Which brings in how vivid and alluring the writing itself was. I loved the prose and the imagery that was given on every single page, with every single line. “I bloom like a rose when I’m handled like a weed” This is going to sound so fucking weird, but if you read YA; this almost gave me Raven Cycle vibes. Like a disturbed, erotic, adult version of the Raven Cycle. We had the whole crew and the mystery and history repeating itself, and slightly magical air. “You don’t pick up on the vibe here? Like this whole place is cloistered in a strange, timeless little bubble? Like a Sarah Waters novel but with pizza delivery?” There were so many plot twists that I never saw coming, and I began to realize that expect the unexpected works so perfectly with this book. I loved every single character and all the dynamics between them, the interwoven relationships, the sexual tension. EVERYTHING! It was so hauntingly memorable, and I'm itching to get my hands on book 2. I need more of Thornchapel and Rebecca and Delphine. I need more angst between Saint, Poe and Auden. And damn, if I don't need me some more Becket and Sir James!!! My cute lil gang of horny, kinky adults and their dog. “Thornchapel waited. And in a clearing in the woods, in a church ruined by thorns and time, something stirred. Something called all six of them by name." The Dirty Laundry I've devised a naughty scale for this book:1: blushing in public.2: closing the kindle and waiting to get home because there is no way people won't know what your dirty little mind is up to. 3: panty dropper4: no need to even wear garments anymore, take the day off work and just... read... ;) If you read this book and enjoy all senses of depravity, you will be somewhere along this scale. (Hopefully) I can’t tell. And I can’t tell who can see what, but I do know that it’s a forcefully erotic idea. That if they wanted, my friends could see my cunt. Maybe they could pet it, maybe they could lean down and kiss it to make it feel better. I could almost cry with how much I want that. In all honesty, I feel like "erotic" is an understatement. But yes, this book was all sorts of erotic but it was erotica with a fucking interesting storyline. I find it really hard to enjoy 100% erotica because there is often no plot or character development. This had all the wet dreams you could ask for but also had me rooting for the characters? turning pages to find out about the certain mysteries of thornchapel? wanting to slip into a coma till the sequel comes out in summer? yes.
2842334712	Reread, because I'm going to finish out this series in 2021 one way or another."********************"In the faint moonlight, the grass is singingOver the tumbled graves, about the chapelThere is the empty chapel, only the wind's home.It has no windows, and the door swings,Dry bones can harm no one."-T.S. Eliot, The Waste LandOk, wow, so hold up one minute. I feel the need to preface this review for my regular readers because this is a very different type of book than I typically pick up. If you follow me for my mystery/thriller/suspense musings, here is your PSA that this book is an erotic romance featuring graphic sexual content. If that's not your jam, no hard feelings, feel free to bow out until the next regularly scheduled programming continues, but if you're here looking for something new, like I was, then follow along as we fangirl over one of the best books I've read in 2019."Everything is possible."To be honest, I wasn't really sure what to expect going into A Lesson In Thorns, but I've been really slumping inside my comfort zone, and have been looking to expand my reading horizons in hopes of getting my mojo back. I've never thought of myself as a lover of literary fiction, but I've fallen in love with the genre over the past few months, so why not give erotic romance a try? I'm no prude, but I've stayed away from the genre previously for the sole reason that I like my steamy sex to be mixed up with a bit of plot, otherwise I lose interest. This book was the perfect balance of sexy (oh lawd help me) and compulsive, fantasy-like mystery. Plot wise, we have a group of six friends who have gone their separate ways after experiencing a rather intimate childhood. Proserpina, or Poe as she not goes by, is returning to her old friend Auden's sprawling country estate to help digitalize the manor's library (swoon) and also find out what happened to her missing mom. All of the friends are somehow drawn back to Thornchapel, and what follows is a sensual, somewhat mystical romp of ritualistic sexual awakening. If you want diversity that feels natural, here it is. Our cast features a wide spectrum of race, culture, socioeconomic status, but also of sexuality. We have an extremely positive portrayal of polyamorous relationships, BDSM, and consent. Bonus-a really cool and honest portrayal of a character with narcolepsy without cataplexy. The ending wraps things up nicely without leaving a huge cliffhanger, but also leaves us ready and waiting for more in the next installment. Highly recommended to readers looking for a super sexy read that also features a compulsive mystery and delightful gothic atmosphere. "Thornchapel knows my name and the crooked corners of my heart, and it wants me to make promises that I'm going to keep."
2753046693	not as wild as people saypros- real kink shit- lots of bi repcons- poe was annoying- saint was whiny- auden was a pretentious lil cuck- every sex scene or reason to justify the ritual sex felt like watching a bad porn
3454289544	”He dreamed and he burned.Thornchapel waited. And in a clearing in the woods, in a church ruined by thorns and time, something stirred.Something called all six of them by name.”Ahh hell! This was so dark, sexy, delicious, mysterious and alluring! I have no idea how Sierra Simone did it but boy, was this good! I’ve read plenty of smut in my life, I’m no stranger to breaking taboos and the idea of BDSM certainly doesn’t cause me to leg it, so nothing that was written on the blurb of this book made me feel uncomfortable. Quite the contrary, if anything it made me even more curious. I mean it’s really rare to read about 6 characters that are all bi and enjoy the idea of ritualistic sex and BDSM. Even rarer that one of them is actually a priest. *lol* So was this as wild as I thought it would be? Well, nope. Either I’ve read way too much smut (which is more than just likely ;-P) or “A Lesson in Thorns” wasn’t as shocking as I thought it would be. I think for some of the more sensitive readers out there this will break a lot of taboos, for me it was nothing new though. XD Anywayyy, let’s just say I’m thoroughly tainted and get on with it. Haha!”A kiss that was almost a bruise, almost a bite, and how he wanted both, he wanted kissing and bruising and holding and biting – and he wanted to shelter them from the rain and force them to kneel in the mud too, and he didn’t know what it meant or why it was happening or even why they were letting him yank them close.”There were many things I loved about this and other things I considered to be kind of unrealistic but I suppose that’s just one of those “It’s me not the book” cases. For instance I found it pretty unrealistic that four of those 6 characters were actually still virgins. I mean seriously? They are lusting after each other and constantly horny but four of them never had sex? Not to mention that they are all about 22 or 23 years old. Admittedly two of them had a very good reason to be virgins, but Poe?! I find it hard to believe that a person is so into BDSM but never even slept with someone. Usually you explore your sexuality first and then go into your own special brand of kink. Just saying! *lol* If this would have been a smut book I’d have booked it as “particular appeal” but since this was so much more than that I just couldn’t wrap my head around it. Which brings me right to our six bi characters I couldn’t help but love.Auden – The Lord:”He wants both of them so much he thinks he might be entirely made up of want, he thinks all his thorns are finally puncturing through his skin and out into the real world and everyone will see and they’ll know. His darkness and his light and all the twines and ravels of his depraved, thorny heart.” Poe – The librarian:”Why am I so messy? So eager? I feel like an overgrown garden, lush and crowded, rioted and jumbled, except instead of leaves and roots and petals, I’m jealousy and hunger and pain and thrill.All the bitter and all the sweet, all mixed together.” Delphine – The Star:”For a long time, I was the only fat girl in my circle,” she says pensively. “Or even in the circle outside of that one. I started the Instagram account because I needed to feel like all the parts of myself were real, and that they were real at the same time – that I was well-dressed and interesting and cultured and fat.” St. Sebastian – The Saint: ”You don’t know what it’s like to see someone you care about, someone you’d tear out a lung just to talk to, and you can’t. You can’t talk to them because what you’ve done to each other in the past is an iron door without a lock between you.” Becket – The Priest:”What are rules when God Himself has filled him with holy fire?Because the other thing he knows is that tonight is holy. And he is a holy man.” Rebecca – The Domina:”Normally, Rebecca is all cool equanimity and analytical composure, and she takes everything in stride – with the possible exception of Delphine. Nothing ever seems to disrupt her confidence... apart from this snarl of hedge and gravel.”It was so amazing to read about people that are bi and comfortable with it. They were all secure in their sexuality and I loved this so much! You rarely see that in books and usually bi characters are always conflicted because they just discover their sexuality. Not in this book though. They all knew what they liked (even Becket) and they stood by it and weren’t ashamed of their desires. It was such a refreshing take on things I couldn’t help but love it! <3 Give me more characters that are okay with being bi!!! For once it was no big deal and I was super happy with it. If there is one thing that is to be criticized then it’s the simple fact that at least one of them could have been pan too. But that’s me counting beans. ;-P”Like you come to a place and instead of planting a flag and saying mine, the place plants something in you. The place claims you, it knows your name and the crooked corners of your heart, and you’ve pledged yourself to it before you’ve even realized what’s happening.”And last but not least, I loved, LOVED, LOVED and absolutely ADORED the atmosphere in this book!!! Thornchapel was such an intriguing place and I would have loved to be there and to discover its huge library and maze myself! This place was described so vividly I found myself wanting to get lost in it. There was something utterly charming and mysterious about it and I really wish a place like that would exist. It felt like Cabeswater, mystical and dangerous at once and I think when people refer to this being the “adult version of The Raven Cycle” they are talking about Thornchapel and the intensity and love between the six MCs. The chemistry between all of them was off the charts and I constantly found myself craving for more. XD”Maybe it’s the dark pants clinging to his long thighs, or the black shoes that give off a dull gleam from the fire. Maybe it’s in the way he presses his long fingers under Saint’s chin and lifts his face to his own. Or maybe it’s his expression, intense and holy, as he lowers his mouth and kisses St. Sebastian Martinez on the lips.”I mean that kiss alone! Give me more Saint and Becket! *LOL* It’s probably bad that I want Becket to drop out of priesthood and to condemn his celibacy but seriously that man is not made to be alone. That man needs to be loved just like Saint! <3 I’m sure most people will love Poe and Auden but if you ask me Saint and Becket were the most interesting characters of this book. I admit I’d love to see more of Delphine and Rebecca though. Those two could be great together but I need more than the few interactions they had. And yes, I’m kinda down for the Poe/Auden/Saint love triangle as well. *lol* Talk about feeling conflicted. XD ”And his blame shifted to hate, and the hate spread from the altar to the chapel to the grounds and the entire house itself. Until the house’s thorns and his thorns became one and the same, and he knew if he could defeat one, then he could be free of the other.”All told “A Lesson in Thorns” was a captivating mixture of delicious desire, intense relationships, beautiful mysteries and a more than just steamy atmosphere. (Figuratively and quite literally speaking.) XD Do I even have to say that I’ll read the second book “Feast of Sparks” soon! ;-)_______________________Ahh this was dark, sexy, mysterious and sort of delicious!I loved the atmosphere of Thornchapel and all those 6 hot af characters. *lol*Definitely not a book to think about too hard, but a book to experience. ;-PFull RTC soon! XD______________________________To all my still innocent readers: (how did you even manage to stay innocent? *lol*)This is going to be one of those rather dirty books so erm yeah... better don’t read the updates if you want to stay innocent. =)To all my already “tainted” and “corrupted” readers: to whom I obviously belong This is probably going to be right up your alley. So enjoy the wild ride with me?! *lol* ;-PTo everyone who doesn’t belong to any of those two categories:I was told this has:- 6 characters who are all bi- 1 of them is a priest- Orgies? really orgies?!?!- And apparently it’s the adult dirty and dark version of “The Raven Boys”?So umm... this was enough to make ME want to read it. Maybe it’s also for you?!Anyway, it’s been ages I last read any smut so here I come! *lol* ;-P
2778704659	This took a while to actually get going, but once it did? God tier smut. Have MERCY.
2905668971	4.5 starsI'm upsetti spaghetti that this book ended as soon as it did. I went into this thinking it would be just vapid smut, so boy was I surprised. The writing in this is actually one of the most gorgeous styles I've read all year, and I'm 100% gonna read more from this author. This had a great segmenting of smut versus actual plot, and the actual plot was.... wait for it.... interesting! I will admit that .5 stars came off of the rating because it was a little confusing, but it was an enchanting concept nonetheless. I just wish there was more direction on why the characters were doing what they were doing because it felt a bit aimless, and by the end of the book, I forgot why the characters were so invested in doing this ritual. Still, I think this book is really modern in how it examines virginity and polyamory. In between the sexy scenes, there's so much angst and pining, and it's my exact cup of tea. I've heard lots of negative things about book two, but I'm interested nonetheless to see where this goes.
2780536281	You know when you're reading a book and it's not really grabbing you by the hair from behind but you still want to finish it so you start a second book to accompany it and then the second book doesn't smack you on the ass while pulling your hair from behind? This is that second book.Honestly I only finished this book so that it would count towards my 2019 Reading Challenge to read 5000 books this year. For those of you keeping count I am a mere 1590 books behind schedule so no worries.
2765535148	this was everything I didn't know i wanted
2753021489	YUS ONE CLICKED!! BUUUTTTTT *rocks in the corner looking at arcs on my kindle*Today is a F#ck it day!! I just can't handle it anymore. I'm going to sneak this in whilst still rocking in the corner!!
2763463808	I'm going to be upfront and say I chose to read this book based mostly on the cover. LOL Call me shallow if you want, but it's the truth. It just looks so gothic and beautiful that I had to have it! 😍 I also heard it was weird, involved group sex, and was a good book by the majority of the people I know that read it. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued, right? A Lesson in Thorns by Sierra Simone is enchanting, kinky, mysterious, and steamy. It's everything I was expecting and more. So many things about this book worked for me! The writing is beautiful, decadent and atmospheric. Thornchapel is like a character in itself, a big historic mansion filled with old, rare books in a giant library, with a huge maze and an ancient chapel on it's expansive grounds. The author does a magnificent job of making you feel the magnetic pull the characters have to this mystical place.All of the main characters' parents came together at Thornchapel one summer and did things they won't talk about. Then never returned or spoke to each other again. A large part of the book revolves around the secrets of their parents, what they did that summer, a murder on the property, and old Celtic rituals. The mystery of it all intrigued and captivated me from the beginning!What about the group sex? Honestly, there is a spin the bottle scene in here that was even hotter than the group sex. I know it's hard to believe, but just read it! There is some kink involved, and that's all I'm going to say. 😏All in all, a fantastic read! There were a couple of things I had a problem with like the reasoning behind many of the actions of the group and individuals and religion. They may make or break the next book for me. No matter what though, I'm glad I gave this book a try! If intricate plots and polyamory with a bit of kink are your thing, don't hesitate to give this one a try!
2666995568	↑ These are the six young people this book is about. ↑They've known each other since that summer they spent together at Auden's family's estate in England - their parents were friends.... or something.Now, twelve years later we're back at that house.Librarian Poe is telling us their story.(Even though we get some pages from the other five's POV too!)Poe came from Kansas to work for Auden. He inherited the house and is updating everything - including the huge library.St. Sebastian is there too. Even though Auden seems to hate him for some reason.But still, those three have this deep connection. Ever since they got married in the estate's old crumpled secret chapel when they were only ten years old. ☺Rebecca, Becket and Daphne are there too.Six friends who love (and hate) each other. Who lust after each other. Who might not tell each other all the secrets and dreams that are in their hearts. Six friends who share and are about to uncover mysterious secrets we can't even begin to understand yet - and maybe not even by the end of this first book!Grab a huge mug of tea/coffee/whiskey, settle down in front of the fireplace on a rainy night and get ready for an amazing story ...(insert this creepy whaaahahaaaaa laugh from Halloween comedies!)WHAT WiLL HAPPEN TO OUR SIX DARLINGS?READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT!═════════════════ Well.

Just a short thingy like:READ THIS AMAZING, BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN BOOK ASAP!But I can't have you running to amazon without a bit more detail. Well, not more detail - I don't want to spoil anything. I don't think I could spoil anything anyway. I still don't know what happened here.☺I LOVED THIS STORY!!!!So hard!I had no idea what I was getting into when I started reading.I thought, ugh, six people? How will I keep all those names apart and how can I remember who did what and who and how and ugh. BUT! Sierra tells us about them and bam - eff you booksalzheimers! I remembered all six names. What they do. How they look. Who loves whom.The reader is immediately in love with all of them. We want all of them to get their happily ever after with the love or the loves of their lives.

2751217209	<3 5 STARS <3This was a unique,brilliant and addictive story.I was mesmerized from the prologue, all the characters, were interesting and original.I was hooked and I couldn't put it down. This is a story about six children whose lives were unknowingly entwined and changed twelve years ago.I love the mystery around the story I was intrigued.I loved every minute of A Lesson in Thorns, there are twists and turns, there is romance, lies ,betroyals.So many things to keep you on the edge and make you crave for more.I highly recommend it!
2838253152	dark, atmospheric, steamy and angsty; a lesson in thorns was the perfect read for a cozy rainy day. my favourite part of this romance book was shockingly not the romance, but rather the aesthetics. It was immersive and transportive, and I felt as if I were in thornchapel exploring the library and maze alongside the characters. the writing elevated the atmosphere to the next level, with some of the best prose I have experienced in a smutty book. while I will most likely not remember the characters or their interactions a few months from now, I will still remember the dark almost magical feeling this book evoked. for a book centring on an ensemble cast and their relationships with one another, I felt like many characters were underdeveloped. I know this is a series, so perhaps that issue will be solved in subsequent books. however, a lesson in thorns felt like poe, saint and auden's book- with the other three as side characters just included to keep the plot going. that being said, I found the characters to hold great potential and I am intrigued to learn more about them. looking at this book from a critical gaze it is easy to find problems and convenient plot points. however, I went into it with the sole purpose of entertainment and I think it succeeded in that regard. I am nothing like these characters, their lives or their desires, but that was part of the fun. sometimes I just want to be completely detached from reality and experience another's life for a few hundred pages. I have heard absolutely horrible things about the second book in this series, a feast of sparks, but a tiny masochistic part of me just wants to know why. I love drama and messiness, so how bad could it be? I will most likely continue on with the series, and will definitely check out other books by sierra simone in the future. ★★★☆☆.5 stars
2854745219	4 starsWell, I can honestly say I haven’t read a book quite like this before. A Lesson in Thornes is about six childhood friends reunited in their early twenties at Thornchapel. The heir, the dreamer, the priest, the genius, the socialite, and the saint. It’s full of secrets and intrigue, and the ending had me so curious about what’s going to happen next. Sierra Simone writes so beautifully and I enjoyed this one a lot!

2761712027	Title: A Lesson in Thorns ( Thornchapel #1)Author: Sierra SimoneI have read just one other series by Sierra Simone. Her New Camelot Trilogy was a shock to my senses and I loved it! I honestly didn't think I was going to shocked after that series but colour me surprised because this book is insane!I can't wrap my head around it. One second I am gobsmacked and the other, I am trying to come to terms with the fact that this isn't a dream and that I did actually read this beauty of a book.A Lesson in Thorns is a slow burn, Erotic dream. Don't expect hearts and flowers.. this book is angst filled, panty-dropping, "WTF!" , mind-blown type of book. I guess if you haven't figured it out, this book is definitely going to push your boundaries, so..if that is something you are not comfortable with ...STEP AWAY from the buy button on AMAZON. BUT, if you are like me...dance to your heart's content and click that button as fast as you can because this book is to die for!A Lesson in Thorn is a book filled with the seductive elements of love, agony, mystery and history that is like a lightning that strikes your body. It's electrifying, addictive and I AM OBSESSED!Can we please take a moment to absorb that cliffhanger?! I mean...come on! Feast of Sparks is expected to be published in June. JUNE! that is ages away 😭
2759283903	Plenty of Secrets & Sex.
2960680796	this was weird afalso there’s a million things wrong with it. namely: every scene in which they were discussing the ritual/trying to justify doing it was hecka cringe.but like...I liked it?idk man. idk.
2838000921	this book well and truly f*cked me up (in all the best ways)
2757340757	Exquisite and breathtaking. Erotica at its finest.
2752719608	This was perfect! An instant fave 😍😍! I like that I went in basically blind (I didn't read any reviews ahead of time). So I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised 😜😜. I genuinely don't have any criticisms of this book right now. I haven't written a full review in a long time lol. So I'm a little rusty. The six characters the story focuses on were childhood friends brought together for one summer by their parent's visit to Thornchapel. All the kids knew was that the parents were "working" on something the entire summer. Something happened that caused the parents to leave abruptly and the kids went their separate ways. Now they are all adults and back together again at Thornchapel. There are these brief glimpses of polyamory between the characters and I can't wait for this to be fully tackled in the future books. And they were all so sex positive and open. All the characters are bi-sexual 😍😍. Simone was able to create chemistry and sexual tension between all six of the characters. It didn't feel over the top or forced, which is an amazing feat to accomplish between SIX characters. Of course I had my fave pairings. I appreciated Rebecca's character and not making her a "caricature" of a black woman. It was the little things that made her character authentic. I really appreciated her inner battle with perfection in a world that sees her as flawed. There was also other little nuggets of social commentary sprinkled throughout and I really appreciated this as well. Becket is a priest and and tries to overcome his darker desires through his priesthood. He was the most intriguing character because his desire and predicament was the most forbidden. He was so interesting that I immediately checked out Simones other book titled Priest from the library. I need more a priest grappling with forbidden sexual desires. Delphine, the social media influencer, was my least favorite but by no means uninteresting. Her tragic backstory was interesting. I was just so much more absorbed in Saint, Auden, Poe and Becket. Saint was our other diverse character and the most broken and tortured of them all. Auden is the rich boy who had a shit father. He is also the owner of Thronchapel. Poe our resident naughty librarian. It's sounds cheesy but it actually worked really well. She was also drawn back to Thornchapel due to her mother's mysterious disappearance. Poe, Auden and Saint had such fire 🔥🔥chemistry. I hope the next book really focuses on them. All the characters were so deliciously tortured and some even broken (both my fave kinds of characters). They carry secrets that I can't wait to be revealed as the series continues. There is so much going on in this story beyond the sex and romance elements (don't get me wrong I'm not complaining; those elements were amazing!). There is the mystery of what happened to Poe's mother. What brought the parents together in the first place? Are the kids heading in the same direction as the parents? What happened between Saint and Auden in the past? Thornchapel has the this otherworldly, preternatural presence in the story. It's fascinating because there aren't any blatant supernatural elements, but the influence that Thornchapel has over the six characters is almost supernatural. It's similar to the magical quality certain places or buildings can take on due to peoples collective beliefs about the place and their superstitions. It really lends to the atmosphere of the story. Then there are the pagan elements that further the supernatural-esque feel of the story. I love that "place" plays such a major role in this story beyond being a mere setting. Thornchapel really added a uniqueness to the whole story. The way Simone explored sex and religion (specifically Catholicism and Paganism) was also intriguing and added some uniqueness (at least for me). The story ended with so many loose ends and I ABSOLUTELY have to know what happens to Auden, Saint and Poe. Rebecca and Delphine? Will Becket eventually break his priestly vows? What is going to come of the shocking discovery at the end?I am just glad the next book comes out this Thursday! I hope the magical quality of Thronchapel isn't pushed aside in the next book.
2758480021	I tried to go into this one with not too high of expectations. We all saw this book take over booktube and bookstagram and everyone was just RAVING about it. I didn't want to overhype it for myself, but I was definitely excited to finally pick it up. When this book began, I was sucked into the story. I absolutely loved the gothic setting in an old English mansion and a ruined chapel. There was a lot of mystery and magic and intrigue surrounding what happened there 12 years ago and now with the six kids are back as adults. I really like that we got first person POV with Poe, but we also got 3rd person limited chapters for the other characters. Poe was so intriguing and unique and I loved her dilemma and struggle to come to terms with her feelings for both Saint and Auden. The relationships in this book were so interwoven and complicated and I loved it!That being said, this book was definitely more of a relationship driven novel. With the mysterious atmosphere and this ritual looming in the future, I did expect more of a plot and more secrets to come to light. There were some secrets revolving around the family and, seeing as Poe was working the library, I expected so many more answers and a much more complex past than we got. While I know that we have a book two and will probably get some more answers, I wish it had a more complex level of secrets and answers than what we got. I'm so happy I finally read this book. I am definitely intrigued by what's going to happen in book two. If you want a unique romance that doesn't stray away from the steam, you have to pick this up.
2783019350	I am so excited about this book that I honestly cannot find suitable words to express my enthusiasm!Obviously this book is another proof that Sierra Sinone is truly THE QUEEN of sensual erotica.I tried so hard not to read this book until the next in the series was out, because I knew there would be a cliffhanger, but what can I say, I am weak...Full review pending.
3838691215	A Lesson in Thorns by Sierra SimoneFirst in the Thornchapel series. Contemporary romance erotica with BDSM.Six adults return to Thornchapel where they spent a summer as children. They investigate the mystery of Thornchapel and their relationships with each other as well as their separate and collective sexual appetites. Sexually explicit with group level BDSM.Cliffhanger.
2848962213	1st re-read 3.5 years laterDamn, I am reading through my past review and knowing that I ended up absolutely loving this series, I can't help but feel a bit embarrassed, I'm not gonna lie. I tore the poor book apart! In my defence, it is the weaker of the bunch, and the reason for that is Auden and the way he is written. He is portrayed like such an alpha male- asshole, and I just couldn't see the appeal, so the whole "romance" of it all was lost on me. I didn't really care for Poe and she is the female lead, therefore I found it hard to connect with the rest of the characters. I liked Becket and Saint, but that's it. The smut is still exquisite, don't get me wrong. Also, the fact that it is so all inclusive, there is something for everyone in there, is great. That being said, now that I know what happens next, I see A Lesson in Thorns with much kinder eyes and I can't help but feel sorry for the things I said about it 3 years ago. I will leave the review there though because that was what I honestly believed at the time, and even though it is true what I said about it, I feel such an emotional connection to the series as a whole, so I can't really say bad things about it anymore. I have to say though, even back then when I felt that LIT was not great, there was still something in it that I found so compelling that I had to pick up book 2, I felt like I wasn't done with the story or the characters and I'm so glad that I continued the series.Also, beautiful covers!1st readIf I don’t come at least once a day, I’m miserable. And yet, I still haven’t had sex.🙅🏼🔴I can't, I just can't. I never EVER give up on or DNF books but I disliked this book almost immediately. I was this close to abandoning it after only 8% but after much consideration, and honestly because I was bored at work, I decided to give it another chance. So naturally, I skimmed.And skimmed and skimmed.Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, skipping all the unbearable pretentiousness (the female lead's name is Proserpina ffs! Poe for short [...]Other ridiculous names are Auden, St. Sebastian and Delphine. So you get the gist...Character development was non existent - the only thing we know about these characters is that they like sex. Like, a lot. There is no other personality or character trait mentioned, no life stories, no background, no talk of families, other friends etc. It's like they exist just to be at Thornchapel and constantly have sex with each other. The only thing we learn from the tiny prologue, is that six 12 year olds performed a fake wedding at a chapel behind some rich boy's house, and then three of them kissed. 10 years later and Proserpina (ugh),being the exceptional librarian that she is,(is there a bad librarian?) is summoned to that guy's mansion to go through some old tomes - I don't exactly know what she was doing there to be honest because a) I skimmed and b) didn't really care.Now, she hasn't seen these people in 10 years, and as soon as she sees one of the guys she kissed when she was a kid, she immediately wants him and is 100% sure belongs to her and all that crap. She then sees the other guy she kissed back then, who is engaged I might add, and she thinks he belongs to her too. And the guy, honourable man that he is, thinks the same.Skim skim skim, and around halfway in Poe finds an old book with an ancient binding ritual in it which is performed at Thornchapel. One person is the Lord and the other the Bride, and they must unite under the fool moon and whatever else, I didn’t get into details.Of course all of them (practical strangers) went “Yes, let’s have an orgy!” (as you do), and decided to perform the ritual. And thus begins a ridiculously over the top tale of endless boners and wet pussies. I know, I know. That is basically the definition of erotica. What else did I expect, right? Well, some kind of story for starters. Interesting and likable characters, maybe? I have read other erotica books, granted not many, and while they still have a lot of sex, it wasn’t all about that. The characters resemble real people and they have actual thoughts and emotions that don’t revolve around getting off all the time.A Lesson in Thorns was pure, unadulterated porn. That’s all.That being said, it was great porn. The scene with Poe’s spanking and the orgy itself which was like 100 pages long, were admittedly very very hot. I personally had some moral objections about a couple of things, but at that point taking the moral high ground was not an option, considering the book I was reading. In a sentence, A Lesson of Thorns was an extremely sensual, tantalising, sexy book of complete nonsense.If you are in it only for the sex and don't care about the fact that there is no story and all the characters are very unlikeable, then go for it. Otherwise, I personally don't get the hype at all.----EDIT: Sorry, did I mention that 4 of the 6 characters were basically described as sex on legs, but at 22 they were still virgins? Yeah.
2889788308	➽ book 10 out of 100This book fell so flat for me and I can't totally express why. I feel like every single book that has similarities to The Secret History always will (sorry to be that pretentious bitch). This has so many tropes that I SHOULD enjoy: ensemble cast, lyrical writing (this is up for debate however), chaotic lgbt characters, proper love triangles. But nothing hit the mark in my opinion.The writing was a weird combination of lyrical and straight forward, and this mix made the reading experience slightly jarring? I felt that whenever the author suddenly dipped into a page long description of Thornchapel, it felt incredibly overwritten in juxtaposition to the black and white scene I had recently read.Also...my god the characters. I liked literally none of them. The only character I maybe could have liked was Rebecca, but I felt she was incredibly underdeveloped along with Delphine and poor Becket. Was Becket even there for the majority of the book? I honestly don't remember him at all and I finished this book about three hours ago.I do need to add that I hardly ever read erotica or smut. Can someone who is a bit more well versed in that genre please let me know if this is considered good or bad? Because I hated reading it, and if this is considered good smut then I may have to give the erotica genre a miss all together.I think it's safe to say that I will not be picking up the sequel. tw: loss of a parent, rape mentionyoutube ❀ twitter ❀ instagram

Y en este libro unos de los ejes principales de la historia es ese threesome Este libro superó mis expectativas no pensé que todos los personajes iban a estar tan fucked up y tan pervertidos a ninguno le gusta lo vainilla. I mean… Es un libro bastante kinky lleno de erotismo en cada página y no sólo me rrefiero a los actos sino a los pensamientos de los personajes y se fue lo que me gustó y a la vez se me hizo diferente que no tenemos un libro plagado de sexo pero realmente si es muy erótico.No quiero hablar sobre la historia porque no sabría por dónde empezar sólo les diré que es un grupo de 6 amigos que se reúnen después de 12 años sin verse.Entre ellos hay una relación poliamorosa MMF, una pareja de chicas gay y un sacerdote bisexual. Es una historia llena de misterio, secretos, intrigas, leyendas y mitos.Este libro es sólo la punta del iceberg, es una introducción a la historia porque realmente no sabemos nada y me quedé con un montón de preguntas.Se preguntarán si se les recomiendo que lo lean OBVIO para que lo platiquen y sufran la espera conmigo.Y recuerden no soy morbosa soy de mente curiosa .BAIIIS.

I’m a complete masochist when it comes to Sierra Simone’s words, but this was on a whole other level. Book one in Sierra's 𝑻𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒆𝒍 series took me by surprise. It’s unlike ANYTHING I’ve ever read and I just want more, more, and MORE! This book is overflowing with such raw sexual energy. It's laced with grit and emotion.

2757909607	Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. This book is utterly mesmerizing and atmospheric and dark and angsty af and sexy and I needed the next one yesterday.”And in a clearing in the woods, in a church ruined by thorns and time, something stirred. Something called all six of them by name.”A Lesson in Thorns grabs you, sucks you in and holds you there until you’re completely unaware of everything happening around you. Some of my very favorite fictional relationships are polyamorous, but this one really takes it to a new level is so many good ways. It explores some very taboo themes, but in a safe and healthy way.This was my first Sierra Simone book, but I am familiar with her New Camelot series, which has been on my TBR for ages. I knew this would be a dark and tantalizing romance, but that is not all. The writing and story itself is riveting and absolutely hit the mark with the gothic thriller themes. I couldn’t help but think of stories such as Crimson Peak and The Awakening, minus the horror aspects, plus the pagan rituals in Outlander and The Forest House.Additionally, it even gave me The Raven Cycle vibes and I was constantly thinking of this quote from Maggie Stiefvater’s The Dream Thieves, “In that moment, Blue was a little in love with all of them. Their magic. Their quest. Their awfulness and strangeness. Her raven boys.” This is basically a VERY adult version of that story. You NEED this book!
3490612108	everyone: this is an erotica bookme reading the extremely explicit sex scenes: 👁👄👁I think not liking this book was more of a me issue than the actual book. I really enjoy romance books but I don't love overly graphic sex scenes (I feel like I have a weirdly specific ratio of explicit to sweet content that sex scenes have to meet for me to like them). This book definitely falls more under erotica than straight romance. There is romance involved but sex is at the forefront. What I will give it is that the mystery was intriguing and I learned a lot about the BDSM community. I genuinely didn't know much about it before and I found the author's explanations to be interesting and informative. I also appreciated the polyamory vibes that it was setting up for the next book. The one actual critique I'll give is that I thought the writing was a bit weak. I think the author did an alright job of presenting an atmospheric setting but the inner dialogue of the characters was kind of cringey and sometimes it felt like the writing style was trying too hard. I think ultimately I'm not going to be finishing the series, but I do kind of want to know what happens with the mystery (catch me DMing someone just to ask lol).Booktube | Instagram | Twitter
4441053935	Erotica isn't a genre I'm used to reading, so I'm having to check a lot of expectations at the door. Everyone in this book is acting like they're in a sex pollen fic; the characters are stunning, breathless, and tortured. No one tells, they "command." No one replies, they gasp. I saw a review of this book which described it as the autumnal scenes of The Secret History, stretched across a whole book. Simone luxuriates in descriptions of lashing rain and rolling-ladder libraries, and I think people looking for sexy figures in dark academia moodboards will be delighted by A Lesson in Thorns. It is, by and large: a campy fun time.That being said-once you know what you're getting into, Simone is undeniably talented at easing you into her sex scenes. The tension between the characters here is convincing and generally well-paced, and there's enough of a plot framework to keep things interesting outside of the relationships. Maybe it's cynical of me to say, but I'm thankful that this book was written pre-2020, or maybe just sits in the hands of a confident author. I could easily see how this polyamorous dark-academia-adjacent erotica novel might stumble into cliche. There's no "I'll burn down the world to save you" or "Touch her and die," though you do still get a bit of the tiny petite feminine girl caught by the big strong masculine men. I can't hold that against it too much, it comes with the genre and also there's canon yuri. That all being said! This book should have a lot more fighting in it. Characters constantly reference disagreements without them having any real bearing on the plot. Rebecca and Delphine talk about not getting along, but it's not clear why, and it becomes irrelevant when the book is interested in advancing their sexual relationship. Saint and Auden have some kind of troubled past-Saint will not step one foot onto Thornchapel!!!-but you better believe they have no problem getting down or spending time together when the plot demands it. There's also a significant argument between two characters late into the story, a real fight that fails to be resolved when the characters see each other next. This contributes to a general glaze of superficiality over A Lesson in Thorns. Simone is only interested in exploring the topics she brings up if they serve either the sex scenes or as instruction towards the audience. Delphine instructs Poe about fat representation in influencer spaces, which Poe thanks her for. Poe's dad tells her about the difference between abuse and kink dynamics as they relate to his own relationships. Beckett is basically a prop as a character. He is only a Catholic priest so that we can gasp at his references to sexual experience. Like this is all kind of SILLY in your ritual sex book, I wish Sierra Simone was more willing to allow her characters to fight and fail in ways that feel meaningful. At the same time, these are complaints but not strong ones. I mostly think it's annoying that a large number of negative reviews for this book read as scandalized that the erotica novel they picked up has sex in it. There are real critiques of this book that lie beyond your own unwillingness to engage with its material, even if I myself don't think those critiques are very important. It's also sooo funny how Auden is clearly Sierra Simone's blorbo. He is just not that interesting.

2808142848	HO.LY.THORNS.This was my first Sierra Simone book, and all I can say is WHY DID NO ONE YANK ME OUT FROM UNDER THIS ROCK SOONER?! Holy cannoli, Batman. I LOVED THIS. It was so dirty, so well-written, so angsty and packed with tension. I was squirming the entire time I read it, and I couldn't devour it quick enough. Just... INCREDIBLE!There is so much to love about this book. I don't want to spoil a thing and honestly, I hope you go in blind like I did. I didn't know what to expect, and I was sucked in from the very first page. The way Simone writes, it's haunting and brilliant. The setting is ALIVE -- the manor, the chapel, the little town, the weather. It all plays together in this beautifully orchestrated symphony to weave one of the most intoxicating reading experiences I've ever had. Truly a masterpiece!I cannot wait for the next installments. I HIGHLY recommend this book and this author.
2758794212	A Lesson in Thorns is a slow burning, sexy seduction. A seduction of words that evoke the most powerful of imagery—places, people, acts—that leave you breathless and begging. Begging for more. Begging for some sort of release.The plot builds upon Auden, Proseprina, Delphine, Becket, Rebecca, and St. Sebastian meeting during a summer holiday when they were children. Yet this group never forgot each other and through a series of events, they’re brought together again twelve years later.In this first book, the main storyline revolves around their inner relationships. And the love, envy, and romance that blooms between them. And there are multiple romances and interludes. Each one intimate, smart, and sexy AF. It also establishes the back story and world building of the village of Thorncombe and the manor known as Thornchapel. There’s a ton to learn. A lot of secrets to be revealed. Much of the story is still to come. I cannot wait to see where this Thornchapel series takes me. A Lesson in Thorns is just the beginning of what appears to be one hell of a sexy, smart, twisted series. ~ Missy, 5 stars
2837374059	Unputdownable and all consumingly beautiful! This book is everything. It’s raunchy, it’s unique, it’s dark and it’s heart wrenching, and I enjoyed every single second of reading it! The ending is a little abrupt and there are instances the plot falls flat, but this is more character driven than anything. I think I’m going to settle on 4.5 stars for this one.
2859258158	*** 2.5 STARS ***I don't really know what to say about A Lesson in Thorns. I think it's kind of my fault that I didn't really enjoy it as much as I hoped I would because if I'd only read some more reviews about it beforehand, I would've known that it includes BDSM which is just absolutely not my thing. But to be honest, the spanking and such wasn't actually the worst part of it and I think I could've ultimately lived with it. My main problem was that the book was extremely boring and nothing really happened until the last quarter of the novel. So overall, there were definitely a few very good scenes in this book and I also have to say that I really liked Sierra Simone's style of writing. But most of the novel just wasn't for me and I don't really have any interest in reading the sequel anytime soon. instagram || my blog || twitter
2877199239	I might be the odd one out here, but I find nothing more exhaustingly ridiculous than a book that is continuously trying to be intense, sexy, and some odd shade of forbidden. Every single scene wants to be the epitome of sexual tension, but it completely forgets to build up the reasons why we should feel that tension to begin with.You know what? Porn is a lot more honest that this. Some beefy delivery guy comes to your door, tears his mini-shorts off and proceeds to pound any human being in sight. Cool. At least it's not attempting to convince me that sex is the deepest and most symbolically charged experience of my existence [spoiler alert: it isn't. I swear, it's not that deep].Also, this book needs magic. Like, for real. Both literally and metaphorically.
2937968489	a hot and steamy version of ‘a secret history’ and i am here for it. some parts are a bit repetitive, but pretty entertaining overall. also, auden and saint are my babes. ↠ 3.5 stars

3914675431	3.5/5 StarsI had seen this book around for a while and when last month I picked this title from my TBR jar, I was so glad to finally have to chance to read it!So, I went into this book expecting a good old smutty read and don't get me wrong, this book does indeed have some smutty and kinky scenes, but it also has an actual plot that intrigued me quite a lot. I so wanna know about the village rituals and what happened in the past with everyone's parents. What part does Thornchapel play in all of this? There's still so much we need to find out.Overall I was pleasantly surprised by how Sierra Simone approached the theme of polyamory, I truly believe it was very well done.Unfortunately I've heard terrible things about the second book in this series, but I'm still willing to give it a chance in the future.
3120846802	MIND. BLOWN.I need a minute. RTC.
2688338672	This book is completely wild and completely wonderful. It made me hot and bothered in such a good way. My old friend BOB was definitely in demand and the phrase wetter than at otter’s pocket was absolutely true life. The book opens with a group of children having an adventure. Twelve years later the group of six children, now adults, are reunited in the wonderful Thornchapel, home of floppy haired, Auden Guest. Proserpina Markham aka Poe (yes, I love that family) is the dreamer and she’s a librarian- hello, that’s my favourite job. God, I want to be Poe so badly. She is back at Thornchapel to catalogue the vast library.I loved how this book is written. Poe is undoubtably the main character of A Lesson in Thorns and the majority of the book is written in first person from her POV. Sierra Simone, very cleverly weaves in chapters featuring the other five characters written in third person and the effect is stunning. They feel like little secrets that are between the character and the reader because Poe doesn’t know. The book has mysteries to be uncovered, adventures to be had, Celtic goddess role play and delicious naughtiness bursting out of the pages.I’m dreaming of lip piercings and lanterns and strange drums are beating in the background. That little minx Sierra has me hooked again. I can’t wait for the next instalment.Spoiler free quotes:“I bloom like a rose when I’m handled like a weed.”“Thornchapel knows my name and the crooked corners of my heart, and it wants me to make promises that I’m going to keep.”“He moves his lips over my temple, then over my face in helpless searching kisses, like the answers he’s looking for are in the curve of my jaw and the blush warming my cheeks, like he can kiss the meaning of life right out of my skin.”“Thornchapel waited. And in a clearing in the woods, in a church ruined by thorns and time, something stirred.”“It feels so good to be fucked, so good like I never want to stop, I want to be fucked forever, I want fucking to be my new job.”Man alive, is it hot in here or is it just the heat from the bonfire as I sit here with my lantern and Imbolc themed biscuit? Celtic goddess role play sex might be my favourite.
2694437017	DNF @ 10 % I've come to the conclusion that unless it's an Addison Cain novel, I'm not very into books focused on polyamorous relationships. This is the second Sierra Simone series I've tried, and both focus on this type of romance. Not my kind of thing. The writing is fine. Just... fine. It wasn't bad, nor was it fantastic. The best way I can describe this novel is underwhelming. I might come back to it one day, when the series completes. But I have no desire to finish it right now.
2749928887	“Thornchapel waited. And in a clearing in the woods, in a church ruined by thorns and time, something stirred. Something called all six of them by name."When I want a steamy, hot romance with GREAT writing (huge emphasis on the word great)— I always hit up Sierra Simone. Period. End of discussion. I said what I said. I'm not usually the person who goes straight for a book like this. I like to read this genre MAYBE once a year. And when I do, it's Sierra. Last year I read her Camelot trilogy and while I loved it, I was good for the year after those three books. This year I will read this Thornchapel series and be good for 2019.A Lesson in Thorns was one of those books that had it all. It had some suspense mixed in with some romance (fans self) added in with some good characters who had a lot of depth. It's really hard for me to come by those type of books when the market has such an over-saturation for just ONE trope or for just ONE type of character. So, the book as a whole was refreshing. Especially when I don't read this genre a lot. "They found the roses right away.The thorns took longer.First, there was the escape, which wasn't an escape at all, really."Another thing that I really ate up about this story was the setting. I got lost in it. It wasn't a typical setting that we read about every day. Not only did the characters have depth, but the setting had an immense amount of depth also. Sierra did an exceptional job at creating a world so real and so beautiful that even if the story-line would have sucked-- I think I would have still loved it all because of the setting itself. Sierra's stories are always so incredibly sexy but they’re still stories. They have great plot lines and great characters. It's not just about the smut with her. Yeah, it's there. You're going to read it. But, the story itself has meaning and I just admire that so much. Sierra will forever be my guilty pleasure author when it comes to tropes like these. In my honest opinion-- no one writes them better than her.
2758545635	A Lesson in Thorns has been on my kindle for the longest time, I am not sure why it was on there for so long or why I had waited so long to read this one here. I have been such a fan of this author and I like the she pushes the boundaries but in a way that most readers won't even notice right away but will go along for the ride. I will say despite the ending of this one, I LOVED this book so much. I am going to keep this review short because I do feel like readers need to go into this one completely blind. I was recommended to go into it blind, and I am glad that I did. From what I could tell there isn't anything super triggering, so as long as you don't get triggered easily, there isn't much that you will have to worry about in this one. I was highly impressed with this story and how it was built into. I really adored the growth of the relationship between the character, there is such a solid friendship and I enjoyed seeing the complexities come to light. If you are a fan of this author and her writing style, then I think it will be one that you will highly enjoy and I can't wait to read book 2 and get more from these characters and I have a feeling their story is just beginning.

2754714990	***5 ‘Everything Is Possible’ Stars***And we have another “Where do I even begin?” Book on our hands folks. This one definitely hit my dark and kinky buttons and kept me turning the pages to hopefully get some answers to the little intrigues that surround Thornchapel. But what truly got me were the characters themselves and how fascinated I was by all of them.Now, I know thinking, “ummm girl they are supposed to fascinate you, that’s why you loved this book” and you are correct, but see, it goes a little deeper than that for me. I’m an observer by nature, I like to watch people interact with each other, animals and the world around them to the point where sometimes I make them uncomfortable because I don’t verbally interact with them (it’s not intentional, I promise) I simply like to get a good read on a person before diving in and this book gave me six subjects that had my brain in its happiest of places because they were all so unique and yet relatable. And since I also got to peek into their minds, well, let’s just say my brain had found its own slice of nirvana. But with my brain all kinds happy, I don’t have a favorite thus far because they all just fascinate me and have me wanting more of them to see where this crazy journey they are on takes them.This is my first book by the author and I was hooked from the start. It was easy to fall down the rabbit hole with these characters and want to see where their choices took them. This is a read that is a little bit of everything in it, it’s dark, gritty, mysterious and romantic in its own way and filled with so many things simmering beneath the surface that I cannot wait to see how it all turns out!~ Copy provided by Candi Kane PR & voluntarily reviewed ~
2929919216	Blog | Twitter | Instagram | Review can be found here at Booked J. "At Thornchapel, time could slip by unmarked and you could walk places no one had walked in years. Maybe centuries." Thornchapel Series: A Lesson in Thorns: ★★★★★Feast of Sparks: TBD Harvest of Sighs: TBDDoor of Bruises: TBD Controversy aside, I loved A Lesson in Thorns so much and can't wait to dive into the rest of Thornchapel. I've read quite a lot from Sierra Simone in the past but this is her best, most erotic and artful work to date. Darkly entwined with its erotic nature, A Lesson in Thorns is utterly unforgettable and impossible to put down. If you've loved any of Simone's works in the past, you're going to devour this one just as it devours you. If you're not interested in erotica, or romance, this will obviously not be a read for you. A Lesson in Thorns is an atmospheric and explicit work of fiction. This, of course, won't be everyone's cup of tea. There is something irresistible in the way that Simone tells this story; her prose has never been better. Every page passes by in a heated blur, with the reminder that A Lesson in Thorns is as suspenseful as it is sensual, as filthy as it is strangely tender. While reading A Lesson in Thorns, I couldn't help but to feel like the estate in which the series is set was serving up the best of classic V.C. Andrews vibes. Simone's writing solidified my feeling of similarity, in the best possible way. While I've adored Sierra Simone's writing in the past, A Lesson in Thorns shows her at her very best and makes reading the novel compulsive and electric. Further, I loved the eeriness and mystery that the Thornchapel estate provides readers as a backdrop. Everything always leads back to the estate, after all. Mostly, I loved the characters and the archetypes that they each represent to the plot and their peculiar and sexualized bond with one another. Poe, Auden, Saint, Delphine, Rebecca and Becket are all intriguingly complex characters with a set of their own complexities. (My favourites are all of them, but my ranking is: Poe, Delphine, Saint, Rebecca, Becket and Auden.) Each of them have a varied connection with one another that makes readers double take, pause and fan themselves. There's something so electrically charged in their interactions, you are all flushed cheeks and flying high. When I say that this is one of the most erotic works of fiction I've read recently, I mean it. But A Lesson in Thorns is more than erotica and romance, it is full of mysteries and plot twists that have the potential to tangle themselves into everything we are. By the end, I was feeling so many things: heat, frustration, excitement and sadness. Sierra Simone hooked me from the start, but by the end? She owned me.

You don’t have to know their middle name to prove to them that they’re worth cherishing and spoiling, even if it’s only for an hour. Or for thirty-five swats and a kiss. And taking the time to prove to someone that they’re worthwhile and enough…isn’t that love? Isn’t that what love is for?”I'm so conflicted 😂Only Sierra Simone's gorgeous writing could make me want to finish a series even though I have mixed feelings about the first book.For one, I love an ACTUAL well written love triangle where everyone has touched mouths (and other things), and I loathe a love corner where one character is shoved into it by two other characters vying for their affections. Before reading this book, I knew this was a triangle and I was very excited! But I quickly realized that there was not ONE but two weak links in this triangle. The first weak link is the FMC, Poe Markham. I was ecstatic to see an FMC who's unapologetically horny but there's really nothing else to her personality. The second weak link was Saint Sebastian, whose entire personality is being sexy, broody and lonely. Oh, and he has a lip piercing (I'm assuming that Saint and Poe are more fleshed out later in the series) The most interesting person in this triangle is Auden, a repressed beautiful rich boy hiding unknown depths, and he ends up with his heart stomped on, not once, but TWICE by the end of this book. Seriously, Auden is the most interesting character in the triangle. The most compelling dynamics involve AUDEN. The yearning/sexual tension/hatred between Auden and Saint was giving what it needed to give, the sexual tension/yearning/I can't be with you because I'm engaged dynamic between Auden and Poe was also giving. The only time that Poe and Saint were interesting were in their scenes with AUDEN. I had no interest in Poe and Saint's relationship without him. I said what I said. In conclusion, JUSTICE FOR AUDEN. (However, if I finish the series it will be to see how the relationship between Auden/Poe/St. Sebastian further develops)I did love the relationship between Delphine and Rebecca, and I hope we see more of that in the rest of the series (yes, clown that I am I will probably be finishing this series at some point)I also wanted to see more of Becket because I will always be a sucker for a hot priest with SECRETS.
5206739906	Wow, all six of the leads wanted to get on with each other quite right from the start...Funny note aside, I just thought I'll like it more. Ends on a cliffhanger as well.
3347657693	"It hurts so much. It hurts more than stitches, than bleeding. It hurts more than breaking."A Lesson in Thorns is a dark, seductive, atmospheric read. I loved the characters and their twisted and complex relationships with each other, but the plot definitely fell onto the back burner and I wish we got more of it. The writing and atmosphere were definitely my favorite parts of this book; they really drew me in and transported me into its world, with its gothic mansion and crumbling thorn chapel. "He wants both of them so much he thinks he might be entirely made up of want, he thinks all his thorns are finally puncturing through his skin and out into the real world and everyone will see and they'll know. His darkness and his light and all the twines and ravels of his depraved, thorny heart."I'm hoping to read the second book in this series, Feast of Sparks, soon, so I know what happens next with Poe, Saint, and Auden.4.25 stars
2868752033	Well, I don’t know how I exactly feel about this book, whether I love it or just merely like it but Here is the thing I’m absolutely sure that I appreciate a lot of elements about it. A Lesson In Thorns will definitely be out of the comfort zone for many readers especially for those who don’t read Erotica but I think it could be a surprise for some also especially of you enjoy books that follows group friends, their entangled web of relationships and secrets. In that regard, it kind of remind me a little bit of If We Were Villains and The Lying Game.A Lesson In Thorns follows six childhood friends that are reuniting in Thornchapel, a remote and mysterious chapel that’s owned by one of the friends, Auden and the story kind of goes from there.I’ll just say this first, The thing that I liked the least about the book is that it has no plot at all, at least in the first 60% of the story even though the story has an intriguing and mysterious vibe that could’ve made this book a spectacular ride for me. The pacing was too slow for me too and I find myself getting bored here and there because nothing was happening at all. I just wanted more in plot terms and I though the author could’ve given the mystery of the manor and its past more focus.But putting that aside, the writing style is superb and so beautiful it reaches inside and fills you with feelings. The characters are written in a very satisfying way, they are diverse, and they are unique and have different voices, lives and motivations. The book also does a great job at portraying the complicated nature of their dynamics and how it is evolving with every single chapter.The book also deals with a lot of serious topics in a very good and honest way, some of the conversations the characters have about family, the legacy we’re left with, friendship and desires are the best I read in a while. There is something about this book is enticing and intriguing that holds you captive and never let you go. Let’s just wait and see what the author has in store for us with the second book.
4274926274	Proserpina is about to return to a place from her past, Thornchapel, to start a new job in its library. There, she hopes to uncover the secrets her mother left behind before she disappeared years ago. She also hopes to avoid the tortured boy from her childhood, Auden Guest. Upon arrival however, she is not only reunited with Auden, but four other people from her childhood as well. Thornchapel has called all of them home, and it’s secrets, rituals, and seduction are all patiently waiting for them to be together again. This is definitely unlike anything I have ever read before. At times it feels borderline fantasy with its rituals and secrets and ethereal atmosphere, but i absolutely loved it. As the six friends attempt to piece together Thornchapel’s history, they unearth one mystery after another. All the while, the connections between them grow from distant childhood friends into something more…. kinky. They can’t fight the ties that are bonding them to each other and to Thornchapel itself. This story involves six people, and while this first book is mostly told in one pov (Proserpina’s), we get a handful of third person chapters from other characters which I loved. I’m glad i didn’t have to wait til their books to get a glimpse as to what’s going on in their minds. There are a lot of secrets and past family ties to unearth here, and while it was a little overwhelming at times, I had to remind myself it’s only book 1 of 4. This book gave me very dark academia, dark fairy tale, kinky secret garden vibes. I’m very intrigued by everything i’ve learned so far, and i can’t wait to see what secrets, rituals, and sexual deviance the other books contain!
2686748654	IndulgeFrom the Latin indulgentia: a yielding; to give oneself up.Readers are in for a once in a lifetime experience with Sierra Simone’s new series, Thornchapel. It’s beguiling and unputdownable. All because Ms. Simone indulges her love – for the sacred and profane; for myths and magic long forgotten; for literature and language; for pretty submissives and tortured Dominants. There’s so much bubbling emotion and seething, squirmy longing wrapped up in this beautiful Gothic package with its undertow of dread and compulsion. It’s a woozy, absinthe fueled, waking dream and quite simply, one of the best stories I have read – bar none. With her first installment in the Thornchapel series, A Lesson in Thorns, Simone has proven herself to be the DuMaurier of kink. I love everything about it – the friends who teeter on the razor’s edge of love and hate, the unrelenting pull of sexual attraction that burns slow and white hot, and the sense that an unavoidable fate awaits them all. A fate that they ultimately yield to even as it consumes them. It’s a story that feels as if time is layered upon itself – a contemporary friends/enemies/lovers drama with a curious Victorian sensibility engulfed by the fog of a pagan past swirling with ritualistic magic charged with sex and sacrifice. It’s simply, stunningly brilliant.Indulge yourself. You’ll regret it if you don’t.“Last night I dreamt I was at Thornchapel again.” All the stars I’m allowed to give#TopReadof2019#WTFDidIJustRead
3705448838	Well… I’m not sure what happened, but I liked this much more than I thought I would, considering that monogamy isn't a thing in this book/universe. 😳I loved the theme of a close-knit group of friends exploring their sexuality in a safe (but is it really…?), secluded space. The distinct lack of judgy, heterosexual people was also very refreshing, as was the overall sex- and kink-positivity. Huge plus for that. Thornchapel itself was a mysterious, fantastic place, and a perfect background for the life-changing events unfolding there. Very atmospheric, even if some things were a bit overdramatic.My one big problem with this book, though: I’m not a fan of the (main) heroine, and considering the fact that most of the story is told from her POV, I had real trouble getting into it during the first 20% or so. Some of her inner dialogue is completely ridiculous. At first I thought I had an issue with the writing in general, but then the POV changed, and bam! it was like I was reading a completely different book. And the writing’s actually really good.The sex scenes were totally fucking hot, too.I’m off to read the second book in the series now! Can’t wait to see Proserpina’s relationship with Saint and Auden progress. Also, Delphine and Rebecca… These two, I swear… 🔥4 stars — would be .5 more if not for the annoying heroine (though I think I'm getting used to her…)
7090399322	If you like this author, you will like this book. She does spice scenes very well and they are on full display in this book. I don’t read a lot of books this explicit very often, I have to be in just the right mood. But when the mood strikes this is one of the authors I lean towards. This one was a treat in that it has multiple spice scenes, not just one or two. This book does have a slight plot, but that won’t be what you’re reading for. I think that the atmosphere was well done, and the characters were developed enough for the story. This one does involve group scenes, which again, is not something I read often, but this one was done very well. I think that this is a fun read, just don’t go into expecting a super deep story. The story is nice, and there, just not the focus. If you’re looking for group spice, then you need to check this one out. Thank you to the publisher for sending me a copy of this one.
2675784167	I don’t know if there are enough stars in the night sky for how amazing this book is. Sierra Simone has, once again, shown us why she is the queen. Poe, Auden, Saint, Becket, Delphine, and Rebecca have me bewitched. Fixated. Thirsty. Needing. Hypnotized. I didn’t think anything could top Priest or AQ... but this had everything you could want in a book, while still leaving you wanting more...***FULL REVIEW TO COME***
2806486166	I have mixed feelings about this book but the cons outweigh the pros. However I’m still giving it three stars because the things I did like, I really liked. Namely, St. Sebastian or Saint. He was my favorite part of this book. And since the next book is from his POV, I will read it. I’ve been in another no review mood lately but I’ll try and come up with something later.
2788027669	This was WILD. It was messed up and thrilling and really fucking gay - I kind of loved it. And that ending?? Oh my god.Trigger warning: discussions of rape
