6876502503	In a Nutshell: A character-driven historical fantasy combining vibes of dark academia and faerie magic. Interesting plot, complex characters, well-handled themes. Plenty of magic but need to wait a long while for it. Might seem like YA because of the characters’ ages, but the content and the plot work for adults too. Loses a little bit of steam at times, but overall, a great option for lovers of this genre.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Plot Preview: 1920. “Camford”, UK. Seventeen-year-old Clover is a commoner with no wealth or connections or even magical blood. So as a student at the Camford University of Magical Scholarship, where almost every student comes from rich families with magic in their blood, Clover knows that she must strive her best and learn enough magic to find a cure for her elder brother Matthew, one of the handful of survivors of a faerie attack on the battlefield during the Great War. But as the study of faerie magic has been banned after that incident, Clover’s options are limited. Clover finds her tribe with Alden – a spoilt rich boy with similar research interests as Clover, and his two friends – Hero (the only other female student at Camford) and Eddie (who loves plants more than anything.) With this trio, Clover learns more about friendship and heartbreak, and yes, even faerie doors. However, as often happens during dangerous pursuits, this friendship too is threatened by an unforeseen event, which creates repercussions even years later. The story comes to us in Clover’s first-person perspective, written as a flashback from some point in the future.Bookish Yays:🍀 Clover: A bit bristly at the start and also naïve almost throughout the 1920 timeline. But also ambitious and determined. Unlike typical “poor outsider” protagonists, she is not afraid to bend the rules. She’s a flawed character, which makes the story a lot more interesting to read in her voice. 🍀 Hero and Eddie, two of Clover’s friends, are excellent secondary characters. Though Eddie gets a relatively muted role, both Hero and he make their presence felt. I liked their individual personalities. Other great characters were Clover’s brother Matthew (I’d love to read a spinoff telling Matthew’s story), and Clover’s mentor Lady Anjali Winter (Indian immigrant, excellently written.)🍀 Thanks to the main friends’ group being in their late teens, the book might feel a bit YA at times. However, it doesn’t have the most common YA pitfall: a whiny protagonist with loads of inner rambling. All the characters sound and act their age without going too stereotypically teen. 🍀 The story is written as a flashback journal narrative from much in the future, and the author maintains this tone throughout. The writing is interspersed with observations, elucidations and emotions from the older Clover looking back on the past events – a great writing choice. 🍀 Love the setting of alternate England, where the Great War did occur, but also had fae interference. The historical portrayal felt fairly authentic. 🍀 The themes of wealth/class discrimination, gender discrimination, knowledge restriction, anticolonialism, and most of all, the selfishness of humans. 🍀 The magic and the faerie content, though not frequent throughout the book, is still fun to read.🍀 The writing is truly beautiful, with lyrical descriptions and lovely metaphors.Bookish Mixed Bags:🌳 The world-building gave mixed vibes. While a few settings were well-described, the rest of the book felt standard. Some parts reminded me strongly of Babel and Harry Potter, though in a good way. 🌳 The concept of “Camford University”, set up as the third reputed university along with Oxford and Cambridge. (There’s a good reason its name is an amalgamation of the other two.) However, though the book could be called ‘dark academia’ to some extent, the use of Camford is more as a location than as an institution of learning. The professor who’s supposed to be Clover’s mentor is forgotten soon after he is introduced. We hardly get to see any magical classes or teachers or training. The only dominant Camford location is the library. I wish there had been a bit more focus on the training part also to make the location feel essential to the plot. 🌳 While I did love the journal-style storytelling, this also means that there is a lot of foreshadowing. Most of it is fine, but sometimes, the foreshadowing feels too blatant. 🌳 Though the title promises us the ‘scholar’ and the ‘last faerie door’, the story has way more ‘scholar’ than ‘faerie door’. You need a lot of patience at the start because the book takes a long time to get to the faerie parts. Of course, once these come, they are worth the wait.🌳 The narrative jumps a decade after a point. It takes time to get used to the sudden change in character circumstances. This section is darker than the earlier ones, but has many more twists and surprises.Bookish Nays:🍂 Too much secret keeping, mainly but not only by one character. It feels annoyingly repetitive after a point.🍂 The overall pacing is quite slow, but some parts of the book drag too much, especially in the initial section before *that* summer, and the final face-off, even though it has a lot happening. 🍂 I wasn’t a fan of some of the events towards the end – they felt much over the top and left some unanswered questions. All in all, while the book could have done better in its pacing and worldbuilding, the story was still interesting enough. The characters worked the best for me, though I see how readers who prefer likeable protagonists might have an issue with Clover. This is my second H.G. Parry book, after ‘The Magician’s Daughter’, another standalone historical fantasy. Both books have good characters and are somewhat YA in tone. However, ‘The Magician’s Daughter’ has better magical elements, while ‘The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door’ fares better in terms of plot complexity. I liked both the books, and would love to read more by this author. Definitely recommended to those who enjoy character-driven historical fantasy. Technically, this is an adult fantasy, but considering the ages of the characters it could easily work for older YA Fantasy readers as well. 3.75 stars. (1920 timeline – 4 stars, second timeline – 3.5 stars.)My thanks to Little, Brown Book Group UK and Orbit for providing the DRC of “The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door” via NetGalley.

6911338245	The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is a captivating, dark academia novel featuring a magical school and the fae. It begins in 1920 when Clover Hill desperately wants to learn magic to break the faerie curse her brother received during WWI. She studies and soon becomes a student at the elite and secret magical academy known as Camford. Immediately, Clover is an outsider, ignored by her peers. That is until she meets Alden Lennox-Fontaine, a charming and clever boy, who welcomes her into his friend group. Clover spends the summer at Alden’s home, where the culmination of their studying and experiments go awry and have lasting consequences. The first chunk of this book has top-tier magical school/dark academia content. It’s up there with HP and The Secret History. The plot pivots away from the school setting but is no less compelling. There’s tons of foreshadowing, which had me glued to the pages. It explores discussions on class and entitlement. I enjoyed the author’s last book, The Magician’s Daughter, but this standalone is even better. The writing is excellent and feels cozy despite the dark content. If you’re looking for a thoroughly riveting dark academia/magical school setting, this is the one. Thank you to Orbit for providing a copy to review. https://booksandwheels.com
6931704894	good soup: another book exploring exploitation at the heart of academiadark academia but make it fae?? loved this
7616024388	now this is how you do a fucking good dark academia book!!!
6361354673	Thank you to NetGalley and Redhook Books for providing a digital review copy in exchange for my honest opinion.Loving character driven stories is both a blessing and a curse. Is it worth seeing so much of someone– seeing their personality, their likes and dislikes, their fears and dreams, their relationships, if it all ends in heartbreak? But I digress.If you like hidden magical schools, dark and forbidden fae magic, and saving the world with your estranged friends, you might fall a little bit in love with The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door. Yes, there’s magic and curses and plants galore, but the true heart of the story is within its relationships– the bonds between our four main characters: Clover, Alden, Hero, and Eddie. If you’re a fan of the Raven Cycle series, I think you’ll want to give this a try. The story is told in four parts, allowing us to witness how their relationships evolve over time; and what I think Parry does a fantastic job showing is how love can conflict with personal ambition.
7313830895	4.5★In the end, it was four words that changed the course of our lives and the history of the world. Perhaps it wasn’t really so surprising. They were, after all, the most important words in any language. “What are you reading?”a slow but immersive read with influences of emily wilde and vicious set in post WW1 england. TSATLFD critiques not only academia but elitism and classism as well, with colonization playing a later part. the first half was a bit slow but enjoyable, i just wish maybe we got some more specificity of the magical world in the every day. i did really come to love this friend group and thus feel the emotional impact of it throughout its course. all four were complex and interesting, with their own unique quirks that prevented them from feeling like copy paste. i especially liked the FMC clover’s later introspection and reckoning with her younger self’s shortcomings and flaws. while there were some pacing and plot issues for me, i overall really enjoyed this and felt quite emotional at the end. i look forward to more reads from parry.
6359816249	I have conflicted feelings about this one!!A dark academia fantasy about Clover, a farmer who dreams of academia and seeks a cure for her brother’s fae-afflicted curse. She attends a magical academy, she studies spellcraft with her friends, and she reckons with the inevitable consequences. Thematically, it's very successful; Parry's focus is on how academia is incentivized to uphold class disparities, coupled with a very earnest "Perhaps the real magic was the friends we made along the way" kind of vibe. But this book is also WAY WAY WAY too long. The story’s direct prose style meant that we spent pages with Clover’s internal narrative about how she felt about each plot point: how glad she was to spend X moment with her friends, her acknowledgement of her own outsider status, her love for magic and learning. This is exacerbated by the fact that Parry really REALLY wants you to go all in on the found family aspect, but doesn’t spend enough time letting these characters build off of one another naturally. I see an easy solution, where Clover’s revelations about her own status and ambitions are revealed through carefully considered conversations with the core cast. Instead, the climax is disrupted by characters cycling through monologues . . . . . .That being said, when it was good it was good, and I can see myself recommending this book to people who enjoyed the aesthetic trappings of divine rivals and Emily Wilde’s encyclopedia of fairies
6939090103	This is 100% a five star book. It’s amazing. I’m genuinely sad that I finished it a moment ago. The plot seems similar to Harry Potter at first, but the book quickly moves beyond that into a unique, fantastic, magical world all its own. Four young friends meddle in things they shouldn’t. Isn’t that always how it goes? They must come together years later to fix their mistake.I really, really hope there is a sequel to this.Thank you to Redhook Books and NetGalley for an electronic copy in exchange for my honest feedback.H.G. Parry is now a favorite author of mine.
6524229997	What a brilliant book. A unique blend of dark academia, fantasy, and historical fiction. Top notch writing, beautiful world, gripping and twisty plot, flawed and dynamic characters.In awe! The story follows Clover Hill, who finds herself thrust into a world of magic in a desperate attempt to save her brother from a faerie curse he's been struck by. In a world where magic is only known and accessible to the elite few "Families" - Clover is really out of her element when she arrives at Camford (yes, a magical mishmash of Cambridge and Oxford). After a lonely start to the semester, being ignored by those who see her as an unworthy of being there because she is not "Family", she catches the eye of Alden, golden boy, and is immediately recruited into his circle of friends (Hero, a gorgeous, witty girl who seems to have it all figured out and Eddie, a nerdy and awkward guy who loves plants lol). Clover always had aspirations beyond her life on her family's farm, but she never expected to slowly but surely be accepted by this group of elites in their wondrous world of academia. She doesn't want to lose focus of her main goal, finding a cure for her brother's faerie curse, but as time goes on, and she starts to develop closer friendships with Alden, Hero, and Eddie, and Camford starts to feel more and more like home, she questions her ambitions, what she really wants from life and how selfless her intentions really are. She and her friends also start unraveling secrets about the faerie world, faerie doors, and it turns out, there's more to the "official" story about what's going on with the fae and their curses. So much I loved about this, I highly recommend going in without reading the synopsis if possible because I was so shocked at how the stakes kept increasing when I thought we maxed out lol. I love how it started as a seemingly nice dark academia story with Clover trying to find her way at this elite, secretive university. Then as she got to know her friends better, learning more about the world and magic system, even more plot threads got introduced and I couldn't put it down! I loooved the complex and layered friendships. Alden especially was such an interesting character and his arc had me so conflicted on how to feel! Hero and Eddie also had so many different facets to them and seeing all their individual dynamics with Clover was amazing. Clover herself was also a really interesting character, I felt so bad for her but proud of everything she accomplished. Even when she made mistakes or was not the best version of herself, I couldn't help but empathize! The fae in this story were also so refreshing! No "magical hot humans" lol, the fae were mysterious tricksters. The "villain" in the story was also so complex and I could talk about that aspect forever but in an attempt to keep this spoiler free I shall not elaborate here for now.This book thoughtfully delves into social commentary on class structures, critiques academia, features betrayal, friendship, family and so much more. The writing was so polished, the world was incredibly magical, and the way second person POV was utilized was beautiful. Thoroughly enjoyed this!! Thank you Orbit Books for the ARC!
6704516567	This was just okay. I feel like it tried to do something that other books have already done better.First, I really wasn't a fan of the narration style. A lot of the book (but particularly the first third or so) read like a diary, with the narrator summarizing her interactions with the secondary characters and how she felt about those encounters after the fact, without the reader getting to experience many of them for ourselves. While the choice felt intentional and the author was consistent with it, this style just left me feeling remote from most of the characters....Which would have been fine if this wasn't supposed to be a character driven story, but I think it was given how unremarkable and underwhelming the plot itself was. The magic system wasn't anything special, the fae and their world were barely in the story at all, and the plot progression too often hinged on the supposedly "brilliant" scholars missing something painfully obvious. And while the initial betrayals definitely caught me by surprise, by the end it felt like the conflict had been going on far too long, and the betrayals got so repetitive.The anti-colonialism messaging and the exploration of systemic inequalities in academia in a fantastical setting reminded me a lot of Naomi Novik's Scholomance series, although the latter in my opinion accomplished it more deftly. So if you're looking for a "this, not that" recommendation, I'd recommend the Scholomance way over this book.
7046974096	This had so much potential but ultimately should have been edited down and the plot refined quite a bit.
6755567316	ִֶָ𓂃࣪⊹✧ 3.75If you want to read a book set in a magical school in the 1920s, where life coexists with fairies, you need to put this on your tbr.I enjoyed this book a good amount. The dark academia setting, with all the magic lessons (incantations and runes), was my favorite because it is so unique, especially in how they create connections with the fairies. I liked how the portrayal of one reckless choice and flaw could affect the entire plot. In this book, I truly saw how people’s greed for power affects their morality and challenges what they tend to believe. The friendship and journey of these characters fascinated me, because, in the end, they come back together to support each other and make things right. Even though I liked almost everything about the book, it was very slow from beginning to end. I think I finally got into the story about halfway through the book. The concept of this book is good, but there are some execution issues that were somewhat lacking. I know it focuses on the main characters, but the depth of them and other characters that actually effect the storyline was somewhat lacking. The world-building is mesmerizing, but at the same time, some aspects feel small and lack detail. There’s also a plot hole regarding the magical abilities; even though half of the answers were provided by the end, it’s still confusing. By the end, I felt like I needed more from the book, but it just ended in a way that was actually acceptable yet still left me unsettled.However, despite all of that, I still felt good about this book. It’s not boring and is somewhat engaging. Not to mention, the writing is beautiful, so I was in awe from chapter to chapter. I think if you liked emily wilde series you should pick this one up, it has similar vibes and a really good plot.Big thanks to NetGalley and Redhook for providing this digital advanced reader copy (e-ARC) in exchange for an honest review.
6888364679	Thank you to the publishter for providing me with an e-ARC in exchange for an honest review!This is dark academia done right. It follows the more traditional dark academia formula that The Secret History sets out - a main character that's offered a glimpse into world of the elite, told from the future, and a central mystery that we vaguely know but don't understand. The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is kind of like that, but with magic, set in 1920s England, and with a group of very compelling characters. Not all of them are likable, but they're all complex and distinct. I don't think the book does anything new in the genre, but it's very well executed.My main complaint with a lot of dark academia books being published these days is that they're dark academia in aesthetic only, and never dive into the actual critiques of academic institutions and the elite. This is not the case here - these themes are central to the book, though it does sometimes fall into the trap of having discussions about colonialism and discrimination with regards to the fantasy side of the world, but not really touching much the mundane side of the world. It's not completely skipped over, but I do come out of this book with many questions about the intersection of magical racism/colonialism and the very real-world racism that would have been present in 1920s England.This was my first H.G. Parry book, and it won't be my last. Again, I don't think this book reinvents the wheel in any way, so if you're looking for that, I don't know if this is going to satisfy you. However, I personally really enjoy the classic dark academia formula, and I think that this is one of the better executed ones I've read in the last few years. I kind of wish the book was a duology, as I do think there's enough content here that could easily have been expanded on, but I think standalone fantasy lovers will be pleased with this one. The pacing of this book is excellent - it's just slow paced enough for you to get to know the characters and the world, but balances that perfectly with the intrigue, so you're never bored.Overall, I highly recommend this book, and I think that anyone who enjoys dark academia should definitely have this one on their radar.
7010712357	Absolutely brilliant!! Was completely blown away by H.G. Parry and now a HUGE FAN!! This book is one of my favorite reads of the year and I see myself rereading it often. Babel meets Emily Wilde and it was a ride that I did not ever want to end. I never knew where this book was going to take me but I was ready for the ride. In the first 14 pages I was already in love and completely invested in the story. I just knew this was going to be a 5 star read. The story focuses on a personal, intergenerational guilt and the idea that true scholarship, when guided by ethics, can be a tool for reparative justice and healing the wounds of the past.The themes on colonization and cultural appropriation was done brilliantly and beautifully. And academia as a tool for both harm and healing. As a fellow book-lover, I connected instantly with our FMC and her love for knowledge and books. “𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐲, 𝐚𝐭 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐭, 𝐈 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐚𝐥𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐝, 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐬 𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐝, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐝 𝐦𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐬. 𝐈 𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐦𝐲𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟 𝐈 𝐝𝐢𝐝𝐧’𝐭 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐞𝐥𝐬𝐞.”One of the things I loved most about this book was the theme of friendship. How it’s used as an unbreakable chosen bond as well as a source of identity and strength. It is portrayed as a choice, a commitment, and a source of magic as real as any faerie spell.“𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬, 𝐈 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐦𝐲𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟, 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐚𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐰𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐝 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐰𝐞 𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐠. 𝐓𝐨 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐡, 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐰𝐢𝐬𝐡 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭.”What if everything you’ve been taught all your life was actually a lie? Taken from another culture and you see others used for their own personal gain?By the end of this book, I was an absolute mess. The climax isn't about defeating a colonial army, but about making the right choice. Everyone MUST read.
6916066109	Thank you Hachette Book Group and Redhook Books/Orbit for mailing me this ARC! It was a lovely surprise in my mailbox!If Hermoine, Neville, Draco and Lavender (from HP, obvi) took on fae and an evil Ministry of Magic together...you have this book! If you are a Dark Academia person, this is the perfect book for you!I loved every character, even the ones I probably shouldn't have. I was attached to each one of them from the start. This book did get a little slow in a couple parts but honestly it was needed for character relationships. I might have just thought it was slow because I was so eager to see what happened but I never skimmed, which was a good sign for me!I've never heard of this author before but I will now be adding everything she has written to my TBR. Her writing style was made for me!
6474373904	This is my third read by this author and I think each one gets better than the last. This story follows Clover in four parts that cover the various periods of her life: as she sends her beloved older brother Matthew off to fight in World War I, her studies of magic in her pursuit of a cure for Matthew’s malady after surviving a faerie attack on the battlefield from a local tutor to a magical school known as Camford, a combination of Cambridge and Oxford where she finds three like-minded friends who join in her interests of faerie magic despite the legality for their own reasons. When their endeavors culminate in a disastrous event, the book picks up eight years later slowly revealing what became of the four students and the repercussions of their foray into a dangerous magic that they didn’t quite understand.While this book is broken into parts and sometimes it takes a moment to adjust to the changes of settings and/or chronological time from one to the next, I became equally fascinated with each as I progressed through the story. The characters were phenomenal. The complications of family, the building of friendships, the suspicions of other’s actions and their motives and priorities were all explored with a fascinating expertise. I loved the various settings especially the school and the Ashfield estate. The exploration of faerie magic and how it works in this world and the relationship to this magic and the human world was intricate and mysterious throughout especially the divisions of class and their hierarchy.I think this story would appeal to both dark academia and fae story lovers.Thank you to Netgalley and Orbit Books for a copy provided for an honest review.
7053496999	The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door by H.G. Parry is a fusion of dark academia and historical fantasy which delves readers into a mesmerising tale of scholarly dreams, forbidden magic and a somber reflection on post war Britain. This is a book of opening doors and closing them, of knowledge holding power and of friendships which last a lifetime.“I hope you saw Camford. I hope you sat up high as we did so often, a strange pale sun at your back. The air was never still, so that the trees rustled and whispered in constant conversation overhead. Sometimes now, when I'm half asleep and I hear the creak of branches outside, my eyes snap open and I'm sure that I’m home.”The doors to the fae world are closed and faerie magic is no longer permitted to be practiced. Yet during WW1 on the battlefield of Amiens a door is opened and a faerie breaks loose. When Clover Hill’s brother Matthew returns from the war broken and cursed by dark magic she knows she must find a cure before it takes his life. Camford, a secret magical academy, may hold all the answers but it is not a place that would easily welcome a young female commoner with no magical blood such as Clover. Therefore Clover must fight tooth and nail to be accepted into Camford and once there she must find a way to belong. Parry has a real skill for bringing her settings to life with elegant, atmospheric prose. Here we are presented a juxtaposition of a Britain recovering from the devastating effects of WW1 and the elusive university of Camford. Oh Camford, how I fell in love with this place, how I longed for it to be real, for me to be able to go there. Camford is best described as the combination of Cambridge and Oxford but catering for education in the Magical Arts. From the labyrinth of corridors to the dazzling library it’s a place of grandeur, a place where knowledge, possibilities and mysteries are endless, a place where futures are made. Yet with every elite institution comes its prejudices and its privileges. In the world of secret magic, only those from the Families, where magic runs through their blood, are readily allowed to study at Camford, rarely are people like Clover permitted and rarely do they accept female scholars. I loved how Parry illustrated the role of women in the 1920s, where they were expected to run a household, take care of their family and eventually marry. This was what Clover’s mother had always expected but this was never the life Clover had wanted, she revelled in learning, reading, broadening her knowledge, and so I became swept away with the story of how she carves her own path despite all the disapproval she faces. “Because we were all pretending, weren't we? It felt like since the war and the epidemic that followed it the world had been irreparably broken, and we were all trampling barefoot through the shattered fragments as though nothing had happened-as though we weren't all broken too.”Clover often refers to Camford as home and Parry makes us see why. At Pemble Hill Clover’s responsibilities are endless and when her brother Matthew goes to war, the weight of taking care of younger siblings and running a farm is placed upon her shoulders. When Clover leaves to study at Camford she’s a young woman wrapped with excitement, guilt, loneliness and fear. There is a vulnerability to her, a sense that she isn’t quite sure of her own worth. For who is Clover but a commoner trying to fit into aristocratic society. Yet Camford is like its own little world, far from the struggles of post war, it’s an escapism of itself and it’s where Clover desperately wants to be despite being homesick. I always enjoy a coming of age narrative and Clover finding herself at university, being accepted into a circle of friends and prospering in her studies, was such an enjoyable aspect of this novel. Then as we reach the summer she spends at the Ashfield estate with her friends once again Clover is opened up to another whole new world, one of wealth and care-free days and a place she actually felt immediately accepted in. Family and friendship are strong themes throughout as most of the motivations of each character are centred on helping or saving those they love. Initially Clover is determined to go to Camford in order to help her brother but once she’s there she embarks upon a whirlwind friendship which introduces her to a life full of indulgence and possibilities with people she can belong with. Charming Alden, elegant and stylish Hero and gentle nature-loving Eddie become the centre of her world and together they become inseparable as they study forbidden fae magic and seek to uncover long buried secrets. Parry really does superbly capture how those years of Clover’s life were intoxicating, fever-dream-like and the moments she was most happy. Yet eventually all good things come to an end and as the novel spans to when these four characters are now adults they must face the mistakes of their past and put wrongs to right. This part hit me emotionally hard as the tone becomes nostalgic, reflective and of great loss. I’m a person who finds change hard to cope with but as Parry reaches the end of Clover’s story she shows us that change is necessary, that to start anew things must be broken, and that good can still come of it. I absolutely loved this sentiment. “Magic was sparking in my blood now, perhaps not as literally as it would be in the blood of one of the Families, but just as truly, and I couldn't hide it anymore. It was like trying to force myself into ill-fitting clothes, all the while twisting with guilt at not fitting them better.”The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door showcases Parry’s exquisite ability to bring historical fantasy to life in such an exhilarating way. It’s a novel which immediately enveloped me in a myriad of ways.
7033199483	It’s a bit mushy/romantic for me. The closing chapters and epilogue seem to drag. Although rich in fantasy, it’s not really worth the time invested. Cannot recommend. Clover, a girl fresh from the farm, wants to study magic and is accepted at Camford (a between worlds campus of fairy land and human earth).Cover becomes a scholar of magic and part of a team to close the doors between worlds after an escaped fairy wreaks havoc in the mortal world. But closing the door means sacrificing the university and her life’s work. Will the team be effective?
7443667860	Thus far, H. G. Parry has written one book I couldn't finish (A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians), one I loved (The Magician's Daughter), and one I was overall meh about (this one). It's unusual for me to have such varied reactions to books by the same author, so I'm a little intrigued but also a little disappointed. The first half of the book set in the early 1920s is straight up magic academia, but as I've come to expect from this author, she doesn't shy away from exploring inequality, nuance, and morality. Clover Hill is a scholarship girl to Camford, the magical university for the elite Families and very occasional scholarship student from an ordinary family. Her determination to get in and succeed is at least in part due to the fact that her brother was hit with a faerie curse in the great war. Matthew is still alive, but he needs a cure, and fast. Clover's interest in forbidden faerie magic attracts the attention of three other first-year students who are interested in faerie studies for reasons of their own.I really liked these parts of the story, even though a lot of time is spent just being a student and hanging out with fellow students Alden, Hero, and Eddie. (Eddie is a poorly socially adjusted botanist - I felt immediate kinship to him.) Parry's Camford is a special place indeed, though mirroring the inequalities of the outside world, and Clover, both female and from non-Family, struggles a bit before finding her space and people. She talks about it in golden terms from a much-later-and-sadder perspective, but it's pretty good while it lasts.And then the latter half of the book is set eight years later, after a number of things have gone terribly wrong, and I actively disliked just about everything in this half (view spoiler)[including the loss of friendship, the suddenly frantic pace of the plot - like 80% of the plot arc happens in the final 100 pages, what an SOB Alden turns out to be, the stupid pregnancy plot twist and narratorial slyness, ugh. All of it. (hide spoiler)] Clover comes across as a bit of a cypher; she's the narrator, but the characters around her are much more interesting. I truly think Eddie deserved better, and Hero too, for that matter.I'll try one more H. G. Parry book to reach a conclusion, but The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is getting returned to the library with no regrets.
7456492473	Almost put me in a reading slump. This book SHOULD be right up my alley and yet...I'm not sure what this tool in writing is called specifically but I've been calling it the 'in hindsight voice' of the MC. When they sprinkle little lines about how they "could never have known at the time" or "these were the best days of my life" or "what would happen much sooner than expected". A continuously nostalgic tilt to everything and yet extremely off-putting to me. It made me want to do anything other than read this book because it JUST KEPT HAPPENING multiple times in a single chapter. Enough please. I just want the plot to keep moving, tell me the story as it happens!! Don't keep alluding to the past and future and this and that then etcApart from that.. I'm not sure what it was but I couldn't commit to the plot, even 3/4 of the way through the book it felt a bit lackluster with all the back and forth of locations and characters selling each other out and still being hung up on something that happened nearly a decade ago.The first couple of chapters were probably the best part of the book and I would have rated it higher if the quality had stayed at that level.
6418964276	30 Books in 30 Days, Vol. 5Book 12/30This was sooooo close to getting five stars. Might come back to this rating later and bump it up after the book has had a chance to sit in my brain for a while. Historical fantasy, academia, friendship, class issues, non-sexy faeries—I just love when the faeries are dangerous, and here they're really dangerous. The post WWI aspect of the book was also a very good choice thematically for what this story was about. Continue to love H.G. Parry and think she's extremely underrated.You know what, no, I've talked myself into bumping this up to five stars right now. [4.5 stars, rounded up]
6418821487	4.5 starsAfter her brother, Matthew, is struck down by a faerie curse while fighting on the battlefields of WWI, Clover fights her way into obtaining a scholarship to attend Camford, the premier magical academy in England. While the rest of the students come from magical families, Cover’s a commoner and must work twice as hard just to keep up, let alone find a cure for Matthew.Clover’s soon befriended by popular Alden Lennon-Fontaine and his friends. They each have their own reasons for wanting to interact with the faerie world and so work together to break the seals that have closed the doors to the faerie realm. But, when things go wrong, will their friendship help pull them together or tear them apart?I love the way every book H.G. Parry writes blends the everyday with magic. And also how cozy her books are! You’ll smell the leather of the books, feel the stones of the library walls and see the dust settling on stacks of old tomes. The story takes its time, letting the reader soak in the academic atmosphere and become immersed in the setting. Even though this is a slow-paced, character-focused novel, I was fascinated with the dynamics of the friendship group and was always invested in the story. Clover grows and matures throughout the story from a young, naive student willing to trust anyone and who will do anything to fit in, to a mature, college professor, recognizing that her drive for scholarship at any cost will lose her the friends and family she’s grown to love. If you love an academic setting, fairy stories, and character heavy novels that focus on friend groups, I’d highly recommend this book! *Thanks to NetGalley and Redhook Books for the digital arc. All opinions are my own.
7040982304	The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is the story of Clover Hill. She lives on a farm in the shadow of Pendle Hill and is the eldest daughter, and as such has a great many responsibilities to her family and their livelihood. She dreams of one day being a teacher, a dream her older brother and best friend Matthew encourages, but it clashes with the guilt of needing to help out on the struggling farm. When WWI breaks out, it tears apart their world in more ways than you’d normally expect; for the Hill family, it brings along the discovery of the world of magic.Kept secret by the Families, Clover must battle against prejudices not only against her sex but her class as she’s afforded a scholarship to the magical university of Camford. There, her goal is to research a cure for the curse that struck her brother during an attack from a fae in Amiens. Fae magic is now banned, along with the studying of it, but Clover discovers in Camford that she is not the only one researching this forbidden subject.So we have a crumbling magical Oxbridge-inspired institution; an unlikely friend group studying and performing magic they absolutely shouldn’t with more at stake than simple expulsion should they be caught; and post first world war Britain. It was a heady mix that utterly transported me. I’ve been hooked on Agatha Christies lately for that nostalgic feel of times gone by, and found Faerie Door satisfied that itch perfectly. There were elements of Downton Abbey but if they could do magic. I completely bought into this world and I’m already missing it a great deal. The only other book of H. G. Parry’s I’ve read is The Magician’s Daughter, and an aspect of that I loved was the world building and setting; Faerie Door has cemented for me the fact that Parry is a vivid portrayer of magical worlds that you can completely lose yourself in.I was Clover Hill, bright and hardworking and good at drawing but nothing special, and certainly not a witch. Who was I to force my way in here, where nobody wanted me? But looking at Camford opening in front of me like a story waiting to be read, I knew I needed to be here.The above quote is from quite early in the book, and that line, like a story waiting to be read, hooked me so strongly. It just encapsulated everything facing Clover so perfectly, it surmised the situation so utterly for me, that I was hopelessly invested in her from that point on and would have stepped through any faerie door for her. It’s a true skill to make your characters believable and relatable to the degree that the reader believes in them, connects to them, misses them when you put the book down; and this was certainly the case for me. Clover is a complex person so well realised; she’s flawed, and she recognises her flaws and doesn’t deny their existence. It was quite refreshing to read a protagonist with that level of self awareness, she reminded me a lot of M. L. Wang’s protagonist from Blood Over Bright Haven in that regard. She is able to admit to herself that whilst on the surface she has left home because she had to, because she was doing it all to save Matthew but beneath that, she’s very much there for herself. Because she wants more from life than toiling on the farm.It would be tempting to categorise this as a Dark Academia; they’re in a university, they’re scholars, they’re researching, and dark things happen to them. But there’s an element of the sinister in Dark Academia that was absent here. Likewise, it has cosy and comforting elements you’d find in Light Academia, but the stakes are just a little too high for that label. It takes the best elements of both and fuels an incredibly transportive and escapist story. It reminded me a great deal of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke; that alternate history, dealing with the fae, nebulous worlds just a shimmer of moonlight away…The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is a story that is going to stay with me for a long time, its echoes will play on my mind. Parry’s writing will sweep you away and bring to life the most wondrous, mysterious, captivating tale. I can’t wait to come back to this author for more.
6757637658	This is the best book I've read so far this year. I loved it so much. Whenever I put it down after I was done reading it (e.g. on lunchbreak or commute), all I wanted to do was talk about it. When I finished it, I cried - not because the ending was sad, but because I didn't want to leave the world. Which also weaponised the feelings of nostalgia and longing that dark academia thrives on, so it just felt like a good tying up of all the book's themes.This was just such a cool book. It's definitely performing dark academia genre convention, but it does so knowingly - the voice, the tics of the expressions and pacing, the cast of characters, are all done to formula but with such skill that I just really enjoyed it. It also meant that I noticed the places that the formula was subverted, and appreciated them more.And the approach to romantic/platonic love? chef's kiss. Honestly? banger.
6365202949	i really liked this but reading it also felt like a marathon. the relationships are well developed and the world is interesting but i felt every single one of these 433 pages and in a way i feel like i’ve read an entire trilogy
7005196104	This book was clearly written for readers who love magical academia (eg Harry Potter) or Brideshead Revisited. If you like both of these, you need to read this.The FMC, Clover, is very much a gender-swapped Charles Ryder, and if she occasionally lacks focus/vibrancy, perhaps that's a symptom of her fascination with her glamorous and privileged friend group at the magical Oxbridge college, Camford. Clover earns her place among these dreaming spires by sheer determination and hard work, after she accidentally discovers the secret magical world of the English upper classes in the aftermath of WWI. (The fantasy elements are quite minimal.)I'm used to seeing toxic traits (ie sin) in romantic relationships dismantled in fiction, but I haven't seen it often done with friendship groups, and that alone was worth the price of this book to me. Parry is always incredibly, uncommonly attentive to relationships other than romantic ones. (Her passionately platonic brotherly love story in The Shadow Histories between Wilberforce and Pitt is something I think about at least weekly.) While there are very lowkey romantic/sexual subtexts, the focus is on friendship, and in a book about 1920s English academics, I heartily approve. The repentance and redemption in this book is framed in a secular way (unlike in Waugh's unmistakably Catholic novel), but still carried much food for thought for me, a Christian.It's rare that I say something like this, but I think CS Lewis might have liked this book. And unlike almost all the books I read these days in an Oxbridge setting, it feels like Parry has been there.Oh, the other books that this reminded me of were Novik's Scholomance series (with the fantasy elements pared right back, and with a MUCH less hypersexed idea of a coming-of-age narrative) and ML Wang's Blood Over Bright Haven (with less despair).
8061044463	⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️½If this isn’t a five-star read, it comes as close as it possibly can. The novel is richly detailed, and by the end, I found myself completely immersed in its world. The first quarter was admittedly a little slow to get through, but in hindsight, those chapters laid the groundwork for the depth and complexity that followed.Many readers compare it to Babel, and I can see why—the influence is clear, whether in themes, atmosphere, or the way language and power intertwine. AThis is my second book by the author, and once again, I loved it. Her ability to weave intricate worlds with layered storytelling makes me excited to see what she writes next.

A story that makes you believe you could reach into the pages and take some of it with you into the real world. The mix of dark academia and faeries was done so so well here, it spoke to my soul in a way I don't know if I can explain. :') I've always been so fascinated by faeries growing up, as a child I was so sure that they were real and would spend hours outside looking for them everywhere, being so convinced that sometimes I would see them out of the corner of my eye. 😭 It just was a huge part of the magic that made up my childhood. So now I'm always longing to find books about fae that would somehow both appeal to the child I was and who I am today.. stories about secret doorways and a hidden world among our own and of course lots of magic. This book is the type of story I've been looking for. Together with the absolutely stunning and enchanting atmosphere, the impeccable dark academia setting, I knew this was going to be an instant favorite.I won't even try to explain the plot...there's simply too much of it and I think it's best going in blind, that's what I did. All I can say is that a LOT of things went on, everything just kept on happening and whenever I thought 'okay, surely this is it' something else was uncovered. The stakes got higher and higher with each chapter until I was a nervous wreck on the edge of my seat, slowly but surely losing my mind. 😭 I loved every second of it. The narration in this book drove me absolutely insane, I LOVE a narrator that's telling the story TO the reader and inviting the reader to be a part of it. The moments of foreshadowing and the melancholy of it all had me SCREAMING, that and the stunning lyrical writing made me not wanna put it down for anything.Okay now.. the found family in this book man... its just done so well.. my god ..their friendship, the complexity of each and everyone of the four main characters, their different goals and the way they all love each other so differently... I will never get over them. They teared my heart into pieces and didn't even bother to put it back together again.(Eddie I love you so much !!😭)The character dynamics gave me the same feelings as the ones in babel and chain of gold did......yup you heard that right, do with that what you will.I have thought long and carefully about this and I'm convinced that you'll love 'the scholar and the last faerie door' if you liked ANY of these books 🙂‍↕️:babel, divine rivals, the starless sea, chain of gold, the last tale of the flower bride & I kind of wanna say the spiderwick chronicles even tho I've only seen the movie so maybe ignore this one🧍🏻‍♀️There is so much more to say about this book and tbh all I did was ramble but honestly you just need to experience it all for yourself! also I am in desperate need of more books in this world, a sequel or prequel or a short story just ANYTHING please I'll take anything!! 😭😭😭 anyway.. stay away from faerie doors y'all
6871088257	Review originally on JamReads The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is a dark academia novel written by H.G. Parry and published by Orbit Books. A great blend between historical fantasy and dark academia that puts the reader in a world of scholar dreams, forbidden faerie magic, camaraderie, and closing and opening paths, all through the eyes of Clover Hill.The faerie doors were closed and the faerie magic is forbidden to practice; during the battle of Amiens, Clover's brother, Matthew, was cursed by dark magic, and returned to house broken. Clover knows she must find a cure, and Camford, a secret magic academy, might have those answers she needs; however, for a person with common origins, getting accepted into such a world is step-up. She will fight until the end to find a place in Camford and will eventually cross paths with Alden Lennox-Fontaine and his friends, starting a friendship that will unearth many secrets about the fae, and will bring consequences in the future.Parry has created a marvelous and relatable character in the figure of Clover: not only we have a girl that is fighting to find a cure for her brother, but who also struggles to find a position in a world that is totally new for her; only through her hard work, she manages to get accepted into the magical society. A strong friendship bond is developed between her and those that she meets in Camford, even when the things take a bad turn. Lennox-Fontaine, in comparison with Clover, despite the friendship, there's a feeling that the position of his family is always there; he comes from the equivalent of nobility in this world, and will do all in his power to avoid any kind of scandal, eventually opposing those that he appreciates. While the other two members of the group are less relevant plot wise talking, Parry manages to give them an excellent characterization, allowing us to connect with them at some points of the story.The setting is another of the highlights of this novel: a post-WWI England, a world where fae magic and secrets are forbidden after the catastrophe at Amiens, and a magical world that is basically the aristocracy; Clover comes from the commoner class, and we can see how that is a handicap to be accepted into the magical families. The academia setting is impeccable, a new world that we experience through Clover's eyes; the prose is absolutely gorgeous, naturally flowing and making this read an absolute pleasant experience.The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is an excellent novel, perfect for those that are looking for a dark academia proposal that plays around with themes such as friendship, loyalty and fae. You can be sure that if you like historical fantasy, this novel is totally for you!
6938792829	If you'd asked me what my favourite book of the year was before I'd read The Scholar And The Last Faerie Door- I wouldn't have been able to tell you. Not because I haven't read any books that I've loved this year, but because there hadn't been one that really stood out from the rest. The characters in this book are flawed, but endearing. There's a sense of found family, but that family is dysfunctional- and oftentimes blinded by their love for eachother. There's betrayal, and magic, and a race against the clock. I haven't had much luck with dark academia, so I'm happy to have one that I can recommend! Idk how this author managed to escape my attention, but I look forward to reading more from her in the future!ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
6941288071	This book had so much potential, and in the end, it was just kind of fine?It's at its best when it's a school story about the main four characters, about being eighteen and on top of the world, invincible summers and eternal friendship and the world is broken and only we can Fix It. And you know it's all going to come crashing down at some point, but you don't know when or why or how, so you treasure the Hogwarts vibes and cozy hangouts and library study sessions and secret forbidden explorations.And then the anvil does come crashing down. And there's immediately an eight-year timeskip. And none of the main characters have talked to each other in that time, and some are functionally different people. Morally grey 'charming and clever does not equal good' guy who I was rooting to end up with the main character? He's straight-up evil. Always has been. All the nuance has been sucked out of him and he's boring now. Guy who's an interesting fusion between Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood? Just kind of a generic softboy who mostly hangs out in the background- half of his personality is doling out plot-relevant info, and the other half is the relationship that he's in (which feels like a retcon- all of a sudden we learn this person is really important to him and has been the whole time, when before he was only mentioned in passing). Arguably the main female character's closest friend? A total non-entity for basically all of it, for Plot Reasons.I just wanted some messy friendship fallout and reluctant reunion and it's imperfect and awkward and maybe not like it was before, but the world cannot break these four apart forever, no matter how hard it (and they) try. And maybe they save the world in the process. BUT NOOOOO. There was so much potential, but it never stuck the landing.Major ending spoilers below, and kind of a rant:(view spoiler)[ Oh, and the villain who murdered a whole bunch of people was just sad Because Colonialism Bad and Family Good. Look, I get that what happened to her sister was really bad and unjust, and I do love a good 'you hurt This One Person and I burn down the world' kind of villain, but it really felt like we were suddenly supposed to think that the villain was justified, despite all the murder and possession and chronic illness and, oh yeah, pointless massacre of uninvolved parties- it was just the few eggs you had to crack in order to bake a cake! And the metaphor used for the colonialism reveal was so on the nose that it was just painful and cringe. (Think along the lines of 'we thought they were the weeds in our garden, but actually *we're* the invasive species'.) I'd rank this exploration of 'the founding of our prized institution is actually based on the exploitation of indigenous groups' as maybe a few steps above Frozen 2. Maybe. (Incidentally, Brandon Sanderson has done a somewhat-similar twist at least twice, and pulled it off with much more thought, nuance, and pathos.)And THEN at the last minute you find out that the main character and now-evil morally grey guy had a secret lovechild from one night of passion before the timeskip that we're only finding out about now?? Two chapters from the end?? (Previously, we only knew that they kissed once and she fancied him.) I hate to say it, but it's shades of Love Never Dies. *shudders* And the sudden reveal that said lovechild exists inspires now-evil guy to have a rather rushed heel-face turn culminating in a Redemption Equals Death that felt so contrived?? It's like, yeah, we can forgive and understand the faerie who killed a bunch of people, possessed our best friend for years and kind of ruined her life, not to mention tormented the main character's brother, but a privileged rich white guy taking advantage of the existing elitist structures just to keep himself comfortable, further his career, and not disrupt the status quo that benefits him (basically kind of a Glinda type)? UNFORGIVABLE, and he even says that himself. (And he didn't even kill anyone- he ordered a house to be burned down knowing that there were likely people inside, but nobody actually died. Which is bad, yes, but the faerie, while having her reasons, is clearly much worse and yet gets a presumably happy ending.) (hide spoiler)]Two-thirds of this book is a five-star. The last third is maybe barely a three, if I'm being generous. I don't know if this book is a three or a four overall. Maybe a 3 and a half? Read everything before the timeskip, then go read some Dramione fanfiction where Neville and Daphne Greengrass are significant side characters, and you'll probably get an equivalent, if not better, experience. Or go read Divine Rivals.
6663636772	Thank you to Netgalley and Hachette Book Group for allowing me to access an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is a dark academia book in the style I usually adore. It’s reminiscent of all of my favorites (If We Were Villains, The Atlas Six) but with a world building that’s uniquely H.G. Parry. I’ve always admired how reverent Parry is of magic; even in the worlds she builds, where magic is ubiquitous, she allows the reader to experience magic through the eyes of people who don’t take it for granted, such that the magic never loses its wonder. And that is the case for the protagonist and narrator of The Scholar, Clover Hill, who is introduced to magic when her brother, Matthew, is cursed by a faerie during WWI. In an attempt to save his life, she forces herself into the upper echelons of English magical society and becomes not just a practitioner but a scholar of magic, even as her relationships with other students drag her into magic’s more sinister roots.The story itself, here, is good. Along with three other students, Clover discovers a way to open the faerie doors that have been closed since Matthew was cursed at Amiens, and this discovery has radical implications that shatter her only friendships, as well as the broader magical world that she has come to love. Clover’s desire to right her wrong is admirable, and a sufficient backbone on which to hang the plot. I was never bored while reading this book; I was fully invested in both the world building and the plot, and was ultimately satisfied with the way things resolved at the end.However, there was something lacking in this book that made me unable to enjoy it as much as I’d hoped. Part of what I tend to love about books like this is the relationships that grow, fracture, and rebuild between the main characters. That can only be accomplished by showing exactly how the characters grow together and apart, and the ways in which their worldviews and morals evolve as they get older. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Clover spends a lot of time with Alden, Hero, and Eddie, we’re mostly told that she loves them and that they love her. And, perhaps since Clover is a bit of an unreliable narrator, I never truly believed in their closeness and affection. Which is all to say that, although I did appreciate, plot-wise, how the story ended, I missed the emotional depth of the characters’ choices and resolutions. It says a lot that I cared more about what happened to the fae than what happened to Clover and her friends, with the possible exception of Eddie, who actually managed to be human and relatable in a way that the other characters did not.It’s possible that The Scholar was never meant to be about the relationships between the characters, and was rather meant to be a study of inherited power, in which case this book succeeds quite well. And some people will probably love this book for that exact angle. Unfortunately, I need a little more emotional depth to my reading experience to really love a book, so while this was a good read, it was not my favorite read. And that’s okay.
6435402341	“What does it feel like, the first time you open a window into faerie country? The nearest I can compare it to is like drawing a deep breath and opening your eyes, when your eyes are alreadyopen and your lungs are already full.”Oh this wickedly beautiful book. One of the best blends of historical fiction and folkloric fantasy I’ve ever read, reminiscent of Divine Rivals and Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It’s a story of real, true friendship, the kind that shifts and changes over time and isn’t always perfect. It’s a story of scholarship, of loving learning with every fiber of your being. It’s a story of doing what’s right, even when it tears you apart. Stupendous. Parry has done it yet again.
6653193894	3.75⭐️ this gave me Emily Wilde and Blood Over Bright Haven mixed together vibes. There were moments where I was bored and ready to give up and then there were times where I was eating this up and would read 20-30 pages and forget I was reading . This was very good, but personally I have mixed feelings. I loved how the Faeries were portrayed.
7065132288	3.5This is one of those times where I wish half stars was an option because this was too good for a mid 3 stars but also not quite good for a complete 4 stars??
6940403575	a perfect stand alone!!!! my chest is full of sparkles and my eyes are full of tears. I tabbed and annotated this one and I mourn that evenings with Clover are no longer.
7078373862	The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is the second of H.G. Parry’s works that I’ve read, the first being The Magician’s Daughter. The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door had the same sumptuous magical setting as the author’s first work, but for me, surpassed the other novel in every other way. I was immediately sucked into the dark academic world, ensnared by the found family and their somewhat enmeshed relationships, and intrigued by the unique magic system and portrayal of faeries. In all honesty, The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is my favorite work of dark academia that I’ve read yet. Though I enjoyed other works of the genre, like Babel, The Scholomance trilogy, and The Atlas Six, all of them were missing a certain indescribable something that The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door achieves effortlessly. The novel manages to capture a quietly electrifying feeling that the secrets of the universe lay beneath the pages of the right book or in an undiscovered secret of the mysterious library of the magical school, Camford, if one only knows just where to look. And if that feeling isn’t exactly what dark academia is about, I don’t know what is. “In the end, it was four words that changed the course of our lives, and the history of the world. Perhaps it wasn’t really so surprising. They were, after all, the most important words in any language. ‘What are you reading?’” To top off this spectacular atmosphere that permeates every page of The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is the incredibly compelling cast of characters. The narrator of the novel, Clover Hill, is an impoverished farm girl who dares to raise her sights to learning magic, despite not being from one of the powerful Families, who are born with a natural proficiency for magic. With plenty of determination and a new scholarship in hand, Clover enters Camford with the goal of soaking up every bit of knowledge about magic she can, and, oh yeah, saving her older brother from a deadly magical faerie curse. Along the way, she falls in with a motley crew of other Camford students who come from powerful Families: Alden, the charismatic, but selfish ringleader and his long-suffering childhood friend; Hero, who is similarly ambitious but pickier about the means to the end; Eddie, the reticent friend who is more at home with plants than people. I quickly grew to love every one of the cast of characters, who were all complex and felt like actual, flawed people with sometimes conflicting motivations. I loved learning more about the intricate give and take each one of these friends had, their childhoods, and their reasons for taking the actions they do. Like many close friendships, their found family has a good deal of complexities and contradictions, and it was truly a delight to watch all of it unfold as Clover becomes more and more enmeshed with their world. “We were at a fragile truce. I couldn’t break it without returning home, and yet I was afraid that if I did, everything would shatter. Instead, I’d thrown myself into Camford life, and it was more than happy to swallow me whole.” Despite loving the relationship between the characters, I sometimes struggled with Clover herself. I didn’t always like her, but I do think this is also what makes her such a great narrator. She’s not just an innocent, naive girl from the country blindly following her more worldly friends into trouble. Instead, she’s grasping, selfish, and curious to a fault. She has plenty of her own desires and isn’t afraid to go after them. It was honestly refreshing to read a female character like her, who is not only ambitious and hard, but also soft and caring. “‘I can’t force you to help,’ Alden said into the silence. ‘I can’t even persuade you—I know you too well for that. But you want to open that door too. If we closed it without trying, you’d never forgive yourself.‘Perhaps, I’ll never forgive myself for opening it…..’‘Not as much as you’d regret never opening it at all,’ he said.” I was also thrilled that a book about faeries didn’t spend a ton of time dedicated to romance. Now, don’t get me wrong, I like a good romance as much as the next person, but I loved reading about Clover’s hunger for knowledge and magical power more than her lust over a man. That isn’t to say that there is absolutely no romance in The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door, but it takes a back seat to the plot and character development, which I appreciated. But I didn’t just love the immaculate vibes, the setting, or the morally gray characters, I also really enjoyed the representation of the faeries themselves. To be honest, I think I’ve about hit my saturation point for faeries, much like many of us did in the height of the vampire craze. I am tired of reading about fated mates and sensual faeries as love interests, so it was exciting to get back to the devious, deadly, and wild portrayal of everything faerie in The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door. The novel expertly breadcrumbs Clover, and in turn, the readers, about the faeries and their powers throughout, making for a very entrancing read. I will say that I did struggle with the pacing of The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door at times. The pacing is not the most consistent, and some parts of the books are much slower than others. I also feel that if someone split up the different parts of the book from the whole, they wouldn’t always fit too well together, and would feel like pieces of completely different works. Despite this incongruity, the common themes of the novel keep the magical tapestry of the novel from fraying, and even when I wasn’t crazy about some parts of the book as the others, I was still invested in the outcome and what that meant for both the characters and their world. “I had ripped open the world for exactly this….But all I could think, over and over again, was that I was in a story in which the foolish farmer’s daughter makes a bargain with a faerie that ends in her losing everything she loves.” And without giving too much away, the outcome is more than worth any bumps in the pacing. I loved that Clover is faced with making a choice where there is no “right” decision to be made. Making the stakes even higher is that her selection would have repercussions for not just her friends, but the entire world as they all know it. The ending of the novel is both satisfying and bittersweet, and perfectly in line with the genre of dark academia, reminding readers that knowledge often comes at a high price. I must say that The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door is the novel for readers who love dark academia, strong heroines, and morally gray characters. I feel like this novel improved upon everything from the author’s previous novel, The Magician’s Daughter, and I'm still thinking about The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door days later. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for any of H.G. Parry’s works.Connect with Me:bloggingwithdragons.com My Book Review Policybluesky| instagram | tumblr | twitter |pinterest | facebook | storygraph | email |
7280880767	During WWI, Clover's brother Matthew was cursed by a faerie on the battlefields and the events left the doors to faerie country sealed forever. Clover, always interested in magic, is determined to help her brother. This is why, despite not being from a magical or wealthy family, she finds herself at Camford, a magical academy hidden away in England. When golden boy Alden befriends Clover, her world really opens up. Alden and Clover, along with their friends Hero and Eddie, experiment in forbidden magics and with dangerous ideas. This leaves their friendship on the rocks and the group disbanding. Years later, the faerie seals break. Clover suspects their old experiments might have something to do with it and she must call upon her former friends if she wants to help save the world from the faeries. It's fantasy mixed with dark academia and it's a slow-burn. But stick with it! It is worth it in the end. The build up can feel slow paced, but it's all there for a reason and we really explore the characters and get to know them well by the time the faster paced ending starts unfurling. And being so familiar with the characters at that point is impactful. I really loved the concepts presented here and this take on magic and a faerie world. I wound up thoroughly enjoying this book.
7556295251	4.5⭐️I loved The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door. It’s a beautifully written story full of grief, friendship, and the consequences of both magic and ambition. Clover’s journey pulled me in immediately! She’s determined and vulnerable desperately trying to save her brother while navigating a world stacked against her.The post-WWI setting and faerie lore gave it a haunting, melancholic tone. The friendships (especially with Alden and Hero) were messy, believable, and emotionally powerful.It’s a slow burn, and some plot points felt a bit over the top by the end, but the emotional payoff and gorgeous writing made it well worth it. One of those books that lingers after the last page.
7039409335	"1 star, really?" I ask myself. Yes. I've been debating it for a week, but yes. It's because: - Boring- Truly egregious telling instead of showing- Academia where? We never get to really learn what they learn. The vibes were weak. - Twist that enraged me with how blatantly obvious the clues were- Twist that enraged me because of how Out Of Nowhere and Poorly Explored it was
7929707630	4.75 stars.My heart hurts.Quotes:"He was like a burning sun. In my experience, you sneak looks at the sun, careful not to get blinded; you don't expect the sun to look back at you.""Eddie was never surprised by what people did or didn't know.""I'm not being a prat. I am a prat. You're seeing my natural form.""God, you're sentimental when you're drunk," Hero said."I'm not, actually. I'm sentimental when I'm sober. A few more of these and I won't care if any of you live or die.""I'm not a good person, Clover. You believe I am because I'm clever and charming, but neither of those things are virtues.""I couldn't help grieving bitterly not just for Hero and the collapse of my entire life, but for what Alden had once been to me and what he had become.""It only hurts because it's in a human body," he said. "Human beings hurt. That was its choice. I don't see why it shouldn't suffer for it.""I had told Eddie that he wasn't going to let it stop him. But perhaps we don't always get to choose what stops us, what catches us off guard in the middle of a dark road and puts us on another path entirely."
7130223063	I CAN'T DO THIS I'M SO SHOCKED AND SO HAPPY AND ALSO SO SAD__________________________________ "In the end, it was four words that changed the course of our lives nd the history of the world. Perhaps it wasn't really so surprising. They were, after all, the most important words in any language. 'What are you reading?' " An enthralling, lyrical, beauty of a novel - historical fantasy at its FINEST, with a dark academic setting and scholarly drama at it's centre. This is like if The Secret History was written in a world of magic and fae. Except I don't want to compartmentalise and limit this book with that comparison, only to give a rough reference!! "I looked up at the stars,high bove the alley in that smoky London sky, and knew that I, at least, was exactly where I wanted to be." The style of writing is retrospective, as our main character, Clover, looks back on the years of her student life, detailing how she first discovered magic through her brother suffering a faerie curse while at war, and her subsequent years as a student at Camford, a fictitious, magical mix of Cambridge and Oxford, where she aims to find a cure for him. In this world,faerie magic has been outlawed, and all the faerie doors have been closed. Clover researches faerie curses and cures in secret, unti she discovers the shared interest, and eventual friendship, of 3 other fellow students.I can't say much about this book without spoiling, and I feel the best experience is one like mine, where you start the book with no idea or clue as to what is going to happen. I had no clue if there was any romance, if this was considered historical fantasy or romantasy, or what the general plot was supposed to be except that we would see a time skip as present day Clover has to deal with the repercussions of her student life (as mentioned on the blurb of the book). And honestly this made the experience even better. I was RIVETED. The setting of Camford is fascinating - a sort of adult Hogwarts but more strongly resembling the English universities of Cambridge and Oxford more than anything else. This emphasis translates to the way magic is dealt with in the book - very academic and yes, scholarly. You really feel here that maggc is being studied - taken apart, put back together, understood, in a way a lot of fantasy books nowadays do not even try to show. "When it worked - when I did that - I've never felt anything like it before. Like the universe was pure light, and I could run it through my fingers and stir it about like water" Clover really values education, and takes great joy in studying and learning magic. She is my favourite kind of protagonist - curious, erudite, giving , in her need to understand this fantasy world that she is in, we too gain a fascinating insight into the magic system and the history and politics of the situation. Kind of like if Hermione Granger was a protagonist instead of Harry, the type of naturally more academic focus we would expect to see in the series - that's what we get here. "I tried not to notice how relieved I was - .... and ran towards the safe glow of books and study and magic." I don't want to introduce any other characters or plot points, because again, I feel this book is best appreciated with little to no prior knowledge. I leave you with this - after finishing this book at 1am, first I cried for 3 hours, and the the next day I ran and bought every other book I could find by this author. Get ready to be sick of me because my TBR has been reshuffled!!!!!!
7006830522	My recurring thought while reading this book was "Harry Potter did it better." I found a new appreciation for JK Rowling's ability to weave a narrative throughline into slice of life, to incorporate foreshadowing details that will only become significant later, and to infuse every scene with otherworldliness and whimsy even when no spells are being cast.For a book on magic, there's surprisingly little magic to be found. The type of magic Parry writes almost seems to be included begrudgingly. There's the barest mention of "it includes hand gestures and words, and when you use magic you feel a glow too" and then long passages take place where the characters neither use nor reference nor experience magic at all. I critique Harry Potter for having a bland, utilitarian magic system, but compared to Scholar, it's lively and full of meaning.The school is mostly an ordinary school, except for the (plot relevant) tree in the library. The characters sneak onto the ordinary roof to eat ordinary buns. They go to an ordinary fancy club and wear ordinary fancy clothing. There's an old mansion belonging to a magical family that's really like any big fancy house with fancy wine, except for one (plot relevant) spare room. I can imagine the environments in HP so vividly, but with Scholar I kept drawing a blank because they're all so generic.The four main characters and handful of periphery characters seem to inhabit an unpopulated world. When I read The Sorcerer's Stone for the first time, I could quickly tell you the names of three or four students in Harry's year, and as many teachers, along with their personalities. There's only one (plot relevant) class in Scholar described in any detail. I remember that a few other students were named, but not their names or anything about them. I can't tell you a single teacher that Clover learned from at Camford, or a single magical technique she studied in any of her classes.That's why the emotion behind the story rings hollow. We're TOLD that Clover loves her magical school, but she doesn't describe it or its magic in any detail to us. The other students snub her, and she seems to have no friends beyond her first year. The classes are a blank. She becomes a teacher yet seems to like neither her students nor teaching. It seems that what she really likes are the generic old buildings of the school, which isn't much to hang motivation on.The first part of the book is all setup, and characters bounce between plot points, stumbling upon them almost at random before getting stuck again and having to wait a few more months for the next conflict to appear. When a character makes a decision to go after a goal, it usually isn't Clover. Clover herself is a jinx to an almost comical extent. I wish the other characters would remark upon her knack for causing others pain while coming out smelling like a rose herself, because that would be an interesting character conflict. Nearly everyone close to Clover is worse off because of her. While reading, I kept thinking "Nah, at least So-And-So didn't have something bad happen to them after helping Clover ... oh no. That's ... not good."Clover is a bland, self-righteous, self-absorbed, and self-pitying character. Her narration is cringe and I got so tired of being trapped in her head the entire book. It's harsh, but she drags the entire book down by being so uninteresting.I did like the few glimpses of fairies we do get (although done better elsewhere), and at least the second half of the book makes use of details established in the first half. But the first half doesn't have an emotional arc of its own to justify the reader wading through narrative summary of an unmagical magic school to learn a few details that will be useful later.
7007223260	3.5 stars. A little bit conflicted about this one! The beginning and first half of the book has a flowing, uncurling pace - we're introduced to the Great War, Clover's humble family, and then the secret of magic and magical families. Usually, this part of a book bores me a bit, and I'm motivated to go on only because of hints of an adventure, mystery, or task to accomplish in the future. And while there is a consistent tone of foreboding in the beginning of The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door, I was actually mostly invested in discovering this new world. The early 1900s, but with the backdrop of hidden magic? Violent Faeries whose world connects to ours? Mages, spells, curses, and magical academies? The worldbuilding had a lot to offer, and I enjoyed sinking into it.Where the book began to flounder for me was actually in the second half, where the aforementioned action I usually look forward to picked up. Quite unusual for me! In fact, up until the moment that the book jumps forward 10 years and transitions into the second half, I could have seen it being a 5 star read.We get all this build-up, these ominous sentences from Clover as she's writing this story down years later, and when the big event is recorded for us readers to see, we get about 10 seconds of aftermath before the story jumps forward in time. Sure, we then do get some recollections about the months and years immediately following, but the punch has been lost. Or, at least was lost for me. And the second half. Filled with action and running and trying to find someone. Filled with magic, explosions, danger. Somehow, the previous soft notes of figuring out friendship, trust, and faithfulness struck a wrong chord and fell flat. They could have rang strongly in these tense moments, but they didn't. Same for the commentary on class, discrimination, and colonialism. And if another point was trying to be made (view spoiler)[ such as the destruction and betrayal that happened in the midst of these "friends" and whatever theme you would associate there (selfishness? secrets? being an awful person ? *cough Aldon cough*) (hide spoiler)], then it was left very messy indeed.I also ended with a few questions on how things resolved. There were convenient plot reveals that I squinted at (view spoiler)[ yes, the baby. (hide spoiler)], plus some logical jumps. (view spoiler)[ For example, the fact that other magical academies existed. Why would just destroying Camford make that much of a difference in the grand scheme of the magical world? Do they all have faeries at their center? I have seen at least one other reviewer ask this same question. (hide spoiler)]This was a miss for me! But a messy miss, as I genuinely enjoyed the first half of the book. I am left with feelings of murkiness, looking at the trouble our Clover and Co. got themselves into and the less-than-clear resolution - especially in regards to relationships - that they found. ....**content notes: death & dead bodies on page (light gore). strained family relationships. betrayal of close relationship. **romance notes: one fade-to-black/implied intimacy scene. some kisses. one character hides their sexuality (gay) for much of the book.
6959713577	** spoiler alert ** I went into this with curiosity, expecting a whimsical faerie tale grounded in magical academia. At first glance, it held promise, but I quickly found myself struggling to stay immersed. While there were flickers of intrigue, the story often slipped into a flat, linear rhythm that made it hard to stay emotionally invested.The book aims to explore themes like found family, identity, and memory—but the delivery often feels muddled. The concept is strong, especially with the magical elements and timelines, but it doesn’t fully come to life. That said, once the story shifts to the future, everything becomes clearer, more grounded, and far more engaging. It was almost as if the book finally knew what it wanted to say.The faerie door, the curse, and the magic system are all mentioned throughout the story, but they’re not explored in depth. They just kind of exist, without ever being fleshed out, which made the world feel underdeveloped. I really wanted to see the lore and consequences of the magic more deeply woven into the plot.The pacing is also uneven. Most of the book moves slowly and in a very linear fashion. But past the 70% mark, when the characters are shown as adults, the writing becomes tighter, the stakes more defined, and the tone much more intentional. It felt like the fog finally lifted.The book tries hard to build emotional bonds between the four main friends, but their dynamic never really clicks. There’s no real chemistry or connection—it felt more like a “found family” the reader was told to believe in, rather than shown through meaningful, believable interactions.Still, while many of the book’s weakest elements—character dynamics, pacing, and plot clarity—do improve significantly in the final stretch, it wasn’t quite enough to push it beyond 3 stars for me.
7130101595	Thank you Orbit books for the gifted ARC.GREAT READ.BLOG || INSTAGRAM || TIKTOK I enjoyed this one a lot and highly recommend the audiobook format for picking it up. I loved the narrator and it had such a great story telling quality that was really engaging from the get go. I loved the plot set-up and watching the slow build of Clover’s character.The middle did fall off a bit and things dragged around as some of the mundane life aspects were happening without the plot changing. But I liked the complicated dynamic and relationship between all of these college students and how the force of time and circumstances changed everything.At least the ending brought things back around and I liked how it all came together. It’s a truly solid standalone that wraps up the story lines in a satisfactory way. I admittedly would have loved a little more romance or at least generation of chemistry between one pair but that’s alright. Overall audience notes: - Historical Fantasy- Language: mild- Romance: one closed door- Violence: moderate
6971224278	The story was excellent in and of itself, but the subtle allegories at the end?! Chef’s kiss. Loved it!
6439832790	** spoiler alert ** 4.5 starsClover Hill is determined to learn magic. Her brother is one of the few survivors of a faerie attack that left him cursed during WW1. Following the attack, all doors to faerie country were locked and the study of magic was banned. Camford, a secret magical academy, is no place for Clover. She does not have magic in her blood nor is she a member of the ‘Families.’ As a rare scholarship student and commoner, Clover finds herself ignored by her peers. That is until she meets Alden Lennox-Fontaine. Popular, charming, and a member of the ‘Families’, Alden invites her into his friend group. The four friends spend their summer together at Alden’s family home where studious experiments go awry and long kept secrets become unearthed.Read if you like:- folklore studies- faeries- dark academiaThis is an excellent book. What starts out as dark academia, with a woman trying to find her way in an elite secretive university, quickly becomes more complex and the stakes continue to raise as Clover and her friends unearth more and more about the fae. I loved the complex relationships between all of the characters. Clover, Alden, Eddie, and Hero have so many layers and individualities but their friendships is what truly drives the story. I appreciated the inclusion of class and gender equality that played a role as well. I can’t recommend this enough.Thank you to NetGalley and Redhook Books for a free digital copy of this book. This is my honest review. Publication date: October 22, 2024.
6760644446	Rounding to 4 stars. I enjoyed this historical fantasy academia novel. It leans heavily on the academic side. If that's not your thing, it might not be for you, but I found the story unique and engaging. That said, I had some issues with the pacing—certain parts felt drawn out, which occasionally pulled me out of the story. I suspect my own busy schedule while reading may have contributed to this feeling, but a tighter pace could have made the experience even better. Despite this, the dynamic between the friends was compelling and emotionally impactful, especially as the story unfolded. I thoroughly enjoyed following their intriguing journey, both together and individually. The final third of the book, along with the ending, was especially strong and captivating. The conclusion tied things up nicely while also leaving some elements open, offering readers a sense of hope. I may even consider rereading it again in the future. “As long as we were still on this earth there was nothing that couldn’t be fixed.”“It doesn’t matter how long something’s taken to grow when it’s rotten at the core.” (***POTENTIAL SPOILER: represents a strong theme to how some civilizations have been built at the expense of others).“Sooner or later, if something exists, it will be used. All we can do is try to understand itsel as we can, so we can use it for good."Last year, I read another book by this author, *The Magician’s Daughter*, and thoroughly enjoyed and loved it. That story had a more atmospheric feel and leaned further into the magical elements compared to this one. I look forward to exploring more of her works in the future, as I truly appreciate the way she seamlessly weaves history and fantasy together. From the two books I’ve read so far, I wouldn’t approach her work expecting much focus on romance (for those who’ve asked). Instead, her stories tend to emphasize more wholesome themes centered around family or friendship.
6757304192	4.5 starsWow, I can't describe how much I adored this. Dark academia, dark faeries, a complex/codependent group of friends in a magical school, openly selfish characters — this book had it all. The relationships between the four main characters were my favourite part, but the world-building was also fantastic. I was completely immersed in this strange alternate history where the faerie world is blocked off by doors. I love how the story came together and the ending was wonderfully painful. I could not put this down!
6882205347	Solid 5/5 stars! This year is such an improvement with what I've been reading. A common trend when I really like a book is that my reviews are much shorter than when I have critics. So, this review should be relatively "short."This book was an absolute gem to read, so engaging with such a compelling cast of characters and storyline! I loved it all so so much. Clover was such a great narrator, and having the story told in past tense as a memoir she's writing was such a cool narrative device as she would often interject when recounting events to let the audience get a glimpse of what's to come. All the characters were so excellent and flawed too. Clover had many likeable traits but equally was selfish and ignorant at times. Alden was a whole slew of flawed traits, but he was still great to read about despite my dislike of him. Eddie and Hero were also great and honestly lacked the most flaws out of the main four but were still very dimensional and complex! I also thoroughly enjoyed how the fae world was portrayed in this book. It was unreal, chaotic, and uncanny, rather than it being a bunch of hot people that go to balls and happen to have wings. I just loooove the how creepy the fae wild can be and this book perfectly encapsulated what I love about it! Also, the way the story intertwines with World War I and the 1920s England is so fun. I really enjoyed that!I think the only things I somewhat disliked was the reveal Clover was pregnant with Alden's baby...1. I just don't like pregnancy in books and 2. it was such an obvious plot device to then be able to surprise Alden with the information and catch him off guard from being evil, lol.I also think this book could have been a bit shorter, but despite its length I also wanted more development of the relationship between the main four. I loved their dynamic, and I totally bought that they were fast growing friends, but I still would have liked more time with them as a friend group. We literally see Clover go from a stranger, to one of the core four, to a stranger again, yet, even with a seven year time jump, is still reminishing on a signular year she had with these people as her friends. I don’t know, fast friendships definitely happen but I just wanted more time with them.Still such a great read that I highly recommend!!
7039204911	5 friggin ⭐️ Never did I ever anticipate loving a post WW1 historical fantasy as much as I loved this book. Our loveable cast of characters from different walks of life becoming the unlikeliest of friend groups at the magical university….priceless. The exploration of what it’s like to have ideological differences with your peers, while also being subject to peer pressure, and just the found family nature of it all really just spoke to me. There were also twists I just didn’t see coming and I was hooked from start to finish. If you are in the market for a standalone that has great characters, interesting magic, found family, and all of the messiness of growing up and taking a stand for what you believe in….look no further.Thank you to the publisher for providing me a copy to review.
6917640369	Thank you to Little, Brown Book Group UK, Orbit and NetGalley for providing an eARC to review!Emily Wilde meets Babel with a skillful blend of historical fantasy based on WW1 and dark academia? YES! A million times YES! I loved every second of this book and once I started reading, I could not put it down again. If you love traditional dark academia like The Secret History, this one is definitely for you.The characters are well-developed, the prose is beautiful, and the plot was captivating from beginning to end, although a bit slow at times. I didn't even mind that the book was more slow-paced than my usual preference, because that way the relationships between the characters developed organically and nothing felt forced.Since we're talking about characters, I feel like it's worth mentioning that I loved every character in this book so much! They are all so fleshed out and all their virtues and flaws make them so lovable. They all stand to lose something, or they've lost it already, and it's in their nature to fight for it and try to get it back at any cost; the author did a wonderful job of making them impossible to hate even in their most damning circumstances. I felt a pang in my heart whenever something happened between them or one of them felt sad, or lonely, or betrayed. I'm sure all of them will continue to live a long time in my mind rent-free, and that's one of the reasons why I cried when I learned this is a stand-alone.I highly recommend The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door to anyone who is a fan of dark academia and/or Emily Wilde and Babel.
7056939000	This seemed right up my alley: dark academia, magic school, historical, found family. Alas, it was not for me. It was at least a reminder that I should not feel obligated to finish books I am not enjoying. What didn't work for me: I disliked our protagonist, Clover Hill (who must always be referred to by first and last name) for several reasons. Her worst sin is being a bit too boring. I wished any of the other main characters was the central character. They all intrigued me more; (view spoiler)[ sadly, they are all absent for huge chunks of the book. (hide spoiler)] There are big time jumps; they could just about allow for filming subsequent Netflix follow-ups if the series does well enough to justify them. The aging of the young actors would make sense. The faerie content was wild and will either work for you or not, I expect. I was more annoyed at the main human character. Some of the faerie stuff was a bit OTT, even for faerie stuff, but it wasn't why I should have stopped reading... Your mileage may vary; I hope my opinion remains unusual.

7190288373	When Clover's brother Matthew is injured during WWI, all is not as it first seemed, Clover soon learning that it was in fact a Faerie curse that hit Matthew, a curse that has left its mark on her beloved brother and for which she will go to any lengths to find a cure. It is thus that she finds herself entering the magical University of Camford, a place she will fall completely in love with, a place where friendships will be made that will change her life forever.My second read from H.G. Parry, I preferred this book to The Magician's Daughter, and could see the author's growth from that book to this. The Scholar and the last Faerie Door is an engaging stand alone read, a mixture of academia, historical fiction and fantasy. Set for the most part in the 1920s, I particularly liked how the author blended fantasy with elements of the real world, such as WWI. This is quite a character-driven story and the pacing, certainly in the first half, can sometimes seem slower, but I felt suited the story that was being told, in that it was important to establish Camford and also the friendships that Clover makes there, in order for the impact of what comes later to have effect.Whilst this is a story of magic, at its heart it is a story of friendships and relationships and I thought Parry did a good job of depicting the initial friendship that develops between Clover, Alden, Hero and Eddie. It is painted as very halcyon, as is their time at Camford and even Ashfield, very much them against the world, in their own bubble, and not always even in a good way. For instance, we see Clover become distant from her family and behave rather selfishly and badly when she does go home, such is she seduced by her new surroundings and friends. The author also does a good job of foreshadowing, such that even as Clover is so caught up in her new world, due to the narrative style, there is this knowledge that sooner or later it will unravel, it is just a question of how exactly? Also close as the group are, there is a sense of secrets being kept, and a question mark over just how much they can truly trust each other. The second half of the book takes place about a decade later, with Clover now a scholar, and not having seen Alden, Eddie or Hero for years, however, when the Faerie seals break, the group are thrown together again, facing the repercussions of what they did all those years before, as well as their now fractured friendships.Other themes that are explored in the book include ambition and pushing the boundaries, the latter in particular I thought the author tied in well with the time period of the rebellious twenties and of the old world changing. There are also themes of discrimination and prejudice, a class system of sorts existing between the Families and ordinary people who do not know of magic, as well as touching upon themes of Colonialism.All the main characters are presented as flawed, some more so than others. I will say that perhaps because of this I did sometimes struggle to connect to Clover herself, as she wasn't always that likeable and her ambition could err on the side of selfishness. I felt that she often chose to see things in a certain light because it suited her, and for that reason she made for somewhat of an unreliable narrator. Also I didn't find myself as immersed in the second half of the book, which whilst faster-paced and more action-driven, didn't quite pack the punch for me and just seemed messier in its execution. Also at times it did feel we were told things rather than shown them, even with regards to how close the group are supposed to be, whereas if we had been shown a little more, I think the book might have carried more weight and depth in the second half. As it was, it did all feel a little superficial.Overall, an engaging read, however, I'm not sure it is a book that will stay with me or leave a lasting impression. 3.5 stars
7899647124	At one point, I thought I would give this 4 stars but my gosh the ending. It may not be a perfect book. For one, it's slow burn so you have to stay put for a bit to really get into it but boy is the wait worth it. I have learnt the following about myself based on this deeply immersive reading experience:1. I love a retrospective tale. The entire story is told by the future self of the speaker. It adds such nuance to seemingly small moments. I adored the touch. 2. I could not, for the life of me, guess where we were going. The story is primarily character-driven while also having the best plot progression I've come across in years. What a true delight.3. This is my first fae fantasy read and it did not disappoint by any means. The fae seem to be simultaneously terrifying and enticing. I see why the characters made the decisions they made.4. I love how the narrative came together in the end. Think of the opposite of unravelled; it ravelled and how. Also, I did not anticipate any of the final revelations. At all.5. The characters are mostly grey; the relationships portrayed in the story are all real, raw, and complex. I liked everyone all the more because they were difficult to categorise. 6. Lastly, in any world, one must not trust pretty boys. If I say anything more, I'd be giving spoilers, so I shall desist. I will not forget this tale anytime soon; it's the kind that will linger and deliciously so. I'm going to leave the opening lines below for your reference. Without a doubt, one of my favourites to ever be written. HG Parry, my girl, thank you. "In the end, it was four words that changed the course of our lives and the history of the world. Perhaps it wasn't really so surprising. They were, after all, the most important words in any language." "What are you reading?"
6867427721	4.5+ stars.Although it may not work for everyone, this book struck the perfect chord for me. Stand alone, dark academia adjacent, a magical world parallel to ours that reminded me of Harry Potter in a special sort of way - honestly, there isn't a whole lot here that I'd change. The plot is slow, and the characters aren't all necessarily likable, but I thought everything was so well-balanced and I was never bored. This was the perfect sort of book to pick up in late autumn. I savored each and every page. If you decide to give this one a try, I think there are a few things worth knowing. Although a magical school is a massive part of the plot, I wouldn't say that it truly commits to the dark-academia trope. Magic in this book is very loosely defined, and it's never explored very deeply; even as the characters research it. There are also two very distinct parts to the story. It almost could be a duology if each part was fleshed out a little more. If you went in expecting to be at school the whole time, you might be disappointed. All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and I'll be looking into the author's other works. My excellent reading year continues with yet another slam dunk from Aardvark Book Club.
7360850457	3.5/5 - rounded downalright, i was really excited to read this book because i had read fantasy novels with fae in them when i was younger and this one… kinda missed the mark for me. sadly there not really all that much “fae action” if you will as a lot of it comes about in the later parts of the book.the book also suffers from sloooowwwww pacing. it made it hard to get through and while there were moments of built tension, i felt they did not contribute to a continued momentum that would have made this book a more exciting read for me.it’s also written in a diary style, which is not inherently bad, but i felt was also something that took me out of the world or at its worst irritated me. there was always an element of the narrator alluding to more issue to come, and after a certain point i just did not want to hear it anymore.i don’t want my review to be all bashing, i genuinely did like the way the characters interacted and how each of their flaws affected the group. i liked the element of a magical university, that was fun!overall, definitely wouldn’t reread and not sure if i could soundly recommend… but had its good moments that were able to slightly redeem the story.
7123056980	First book of 2025 was a winner! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Some books make you believe in magic, and this is one of them. Absolutely beautifully written, succinct and did in one standalone novel what many struggle to do in a series. We follow a young girl who goes against all odds to study magic, save her brother, and hopefully change the world. Camford is the magical version of Oxford and Cambridge and has Harry Potter vibes, we meet new friends, go on whirlwind adventures and learn more about the world. Hard to explain really too much more without giving more away but if you like Harry Potter vibes but can’t bring yourself to start another fantasy series, this is perfect for you! This is purely fantasy/adventure type read with a touch of romance but romance is not a focus of the story but the plot is well done and moves along well. Would recommend this to most readers, especially if you like fantasy. This is everything I want dark academia to be and a lot of what I hoped to find in Babel.
7488827595	This was a tome of magical academia that redeemed its ridiculous length at the end. I enjoyed the story - it was a fantastic coming of age story with strong themes of found family and self-discovery. But my goodness, it was LONG- almost unnecessarily long. It’s written like a book from the early 1900s written by a scholar, which makes sense but, in my opinion, it could have been whittled down to 400 pages instead of 600+. Some parts of the ending had my jaw on the floor. I listened to this as an audiobook. The narrator was very talented. I had no issue differentiating who was who and her male voices were good. I’m fairly certain I wouldn’t have been able to finish this book if I read the physical book.
6743792643	5/5!!!!!Dark Academia + Fae magic will ALWAYS be a great combo, but Parry REALLLLY nailed it here! I was intrigued at every point of this read and the twists were huge surprises to me (THE END?!?!). The amount of world building was just right, loved Clover, Eddie and Hero (petty about Alden). It was amazing as a standalone, but lowkey wish this was a series (I feel like I say this about all standalones I love) Thank you to Net Galley and to the Publisher for allowing me to read an ARC of this read (even though it is already out; sorry!!)
7512982835	A tale of the fae married with dark academia. I enjoyed this greatly. I will reread this at some point. The first part was a lot slow but I realize our MC needs time to find their footing in this world. My only concern? It wraps up very quickly and maybe I needed to understand why. Maybe everything does need to be remade in order to avoid past mistakes. 4.5 stars
8063251257	Oh how I loved everything about this book. A mix of dark academia, magic, found family, fae, war, books, friendship, love. So good. And it’s a standalone?? Ahhh loved. It.I had a great time with it, loved every character, great relationships. If you loved Babel, you’ll love this one. You’ll find more magic in this one, which I appreciate. It has discussions about gender, class, power and how awful people are.I liked it a lot! And great ending!
6962837625	I love Parry’s slow burn historical fantasies, and this was my favorite book of hers read to date. It was an Aardvark Book Club pick almost a year ago, and has sat in my TBR pile patiently waiting to be consumed. Thanks to GoodReads Fall challenge, it got bumped up!This one had great character development and kept me intrigued all the way through. Loved the backdrop of time after WWI and the academic setting. Fed right to my nerdy self 😅🧚‍♀️🧙🏻‍♀️
7184710513	WHY arent more ppl reading this? You say you like dark academia? You like fairies?? GET IN HEREA slow pace at the start and then this book kicks into VERY high gear and kept me glued to the edge of my seat on a 5 hour drive to Virginia. Srsly GET IN HERE4.5 rounding up
8093251024	Listened to the audiobook. Really enjoyed the storyline and there were plenty of little twists to keep me guessing. Would definitely recommend!
6873283489	5 Stars!!I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! Now this is the fantasy academia i love!!! That ending though! I just got the authors other books!!! I need more!!
6851011519	I have read a handful of heart wrenching historical fiction fantasy this year, but this one is by far the best. 🥹It has all the elements that you want in a book - family, friendship, ambition, disparity, historical backdrop, mystery, and a story that ends in a full circle. The twists were well placed - the author dropping it in places that would hurt the most. ❤️‍🩹
7915708123	This is the kind of book about magical school that I’m tryin to read. This was so so good, the characters were wonderful and believable, the setting was cozy, dark, fall vibes, and the story was gripping
6928210638	Thanks to NetGalley, Little, Brown Book Group and H.G. Parry for this ARC. All opinions are my own.5 stars because I can't give 6.If somebody took everything good from THE SECRET HISTORY and HARRY POTTER, blended the ingredients to make them even better, it would result in H.G. Parry's THE SCHOLAR AND THE LAST FAERIE DOOR.In the aftermath of WWI, Clover Hill, desperate to save her older brother from a faerie curse, puts her efforts into and succeeds at learning magic, enough to get a scholarship to Camden, Britain's secret, magical university. She is befriended by a group of students who recognise her desire to learn about fae magic and involve her into their own, forbidden doings. It's a story about despair, about friendship, about academia, and it's written in the best way you could possibly imagine. I adored everything about this. From the prose and world-building to character development and their relationships, the intricate ways everything in this universe is connected, and a magic system that is simple yet perfect for the purposes of the narrative. I could spend hours talking about this book. I cried, I laughed, I loved and I lost, and for the time I spent reading this, I existed in an entirely different universe. I wish I could read it all over again. I wish there were sequels and prequels and spin-offs just as much as I don't, because it was perfect just as it was. It's relatively slower-paced, so if you're someone expecting action from the get-go, this may not be the right fit. A lot of the story deals with the characters and their relationships, which is why THE SECRET HISTORY kept popping into my head, though I'd argue this is better written. The first part is perfect. It's everything I could've wanted from a book, as a child who grew up reading HARRY POTTER and the like, and eventually turned to dark academia. It's as if it was written for me. After the time-skip, things pick up and so does the action, everything comes to a high, and it's a brilliant pay-off. It's been a while since I've read a book I loved this much, but I know I'll be recommending it to absolutely everybody for as long as I live.
7368823054	{3.5}I am in between two ratings, and I have no idea which one will win.POST BOOK CLUBI love Eddie, thank you.The scary blonde man never wins.I really liked the writing and was shocked at the end (IYKYK) but the first half was a bit slow.Time for Fairy Cakes!
6371662756	That's one of my favorite books of the year.If you're looking for a mix of Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries and Harry Potter (but by an author who isn't openly transphobic),I can't recommend The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door enough. I was a tiny bit worried coming into it, as I don't like true wars in my reads, but decided to give it a go as I've loved The Magician's Daughter by the author, and it was so good. We follow a girl who learns that elites of UK have the ability to use magic when her brother comes home after a war, stricken by a faerie curse. She wants to help him, so she decides to try her best to learn magic in an academy, possibly earning herself a life of her own, not depending on having a husband. It's a book for people who love reading about found family, scary faeries (as opposed to the sexy ones) and a love for knowledge. It was very very immersive and the way it's told lets you know from the very beginning that not everything ends well, so there's also foreboding. There are complicated familial relations and trying to sort out your priorities in life, hidden societies, magical libraries and a queer rep. Honestly, so much is packed into this book and I've known it would be 5✨ from the very beginning. It was also probably the 'highest' 5 star book I've had this year, I wouldn't change anything about it. It's vastly underhyped and it was everything I've been looking for in a story. In a way, it made me remember what I've felt as a kid, sinking into books and forgetting about real world.
