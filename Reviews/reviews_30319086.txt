2017885442	You can justify anything, if you do it poetically enough. this is going to be one of my favorite books of the year... almost definitely. I’m saying that now on January 26th because I want you all to know. I genuinely cannot remember the last time I found myself so utterly engaged in a book. Okay, so this is a drama set at a Shakespeare theater, in which a group of theater actors accidentally kill a man and deal with the fallout. Yay! Fun happy stuff. As the plays continue, their roles within this drama shift and switch, ironically mirroring their respective development, and they accidentally get way too involved in several plays as they are occuring. Dark academia is actually such a compelling and amazing genre to me, always, but Shakespearean drama is perhaps the best dark academia pick out there. We have moral intrigue!! long soliloquys!! everyone knows who he is, but he still has plenty of speeches no one knows!! gay subtext used to its best degree!! We cracked up. But we didn't really shatter until we came back together again. The seven lead characters each fit into well-known archetypes:→Oliver - the lacking-type boy.→James - the good guy. →Alexander - the villain.→Meredith - the sexpot. →Wren - the ingenue. →Phillipa - the lacking-type girl. bi. I have no proof but definitely bi. →Richard - the dick himself. The degree to which the character dynamics affect this plot is just so so amazing. There is a genuine actual love triangle, as in every branch has some weird tension. (Actually, I don’t know how to make a love dynamic of this friend circle. Help them.)I don’t really know how to describe what made this book so completely enthralling. This isn’t a book focused on plot twists; I figured out most of the plot points here, actually, aside from a couple mini reveals. Yet every plot point, whether guessed or not, is satisfying, placed perfectly and used perfectly. This is a Shakespearean tragedy and on some level, we know how it ends. But it is completely impossible to get off the tracks. “But that is how a tragedy like ours or King Lear breaks your heart—by making you believe that the ending might still be happy, until the very last minute.” And you know what, this book would have been a five no matter how it ended, but the ending made me screech out loud. So there’s that. I want to thank Chaima, Melanie, and Aleksandra for encouraging me to read this, because honestly... dear god.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
5508761242	— 5 stars ✰ “when did we become such terrible people?”“maybe we’ve always been terrible” i don’t even know where to begin. head empty. just pain. this book was everything i thought it wouldn’t be. and it consumed me in the best way possible, i don’t think i can ever move on from this masterpiece. the foreshadowing in this book is utterly crazy.seven friends, bound by the same passion. for years they’ve played the same type of roles. but as the casting changes, so did their lives. “i couldn’t help feeling that the balanceof power had somehow shifted” the author did an incredibly amazing job to write multi-layered characters. their development and depth was so mesmerizing and i couldn’t help but be amazed by the foreshadowing of each characters fate. “people always forget about filippa. and later they always wish they hadn’t” this book took my by surprise and had me hooked til the ending. act one may have been a bit slow but as the plot started rolling, so did my insides because by the end of the book i felt sick and nauseous all the same. i can’t even pin point what’s so captivating about this book. i guess it’s about the characters and the foreshadowing here. most “plot twists” i already guessed beforehand so i wasn’t really that surprised but in return i was more shocked with the ending itself. i honestly just want to reread the book just so i can find all the easter eggs hidden behind the passages that i didn’t get the first time reading it. i just know that they’re more to be found.this book altered by brain chemistry, crying throwing up, no one talk to me for 7 business days because i need to process this ending 🤧 “his whole world is falling apart & once he realizes he can’t stop it or fix it or change it, there’s only one thing left to do” —rtc, i am unwell 🤧🤧like maya would say, currently staring at my wall and thinking—BR with like 13 people?💀😭 wish us luck
4068472994	Just got word - there's a new set of the coolest possible things you can be.1) very into Shakespeare (can quote at length in casual conversation)2) unbearably pretentious3) complicit in a murder with your group of friendsYou might think that the coolest things you can be might include traditional things, like "in possession of a motorcycle" or "a New York-based artist with family money" or "on some sort of high school athletic team / squad designated to cheer on said team."But you'd be wrong.Dark academia knocks all of those things out of the water.I loved this book very much, as I love anything that even slightly reminds me of The Secret History, and anything that invests me insanely in a set of annoying (at best) or criminal (at worst) characters, and anything with a plot so twisty and intense that it makes my heart beat faster, and anything whose ending I dread (even as I found the book less and less interesting as it went on).This is not a perfect book, but books with all of those traits are in short supply. And far be it from me to turn away any dark academia options.Beggars can't be choosers.Bottom line: Tell me any book that can help me relive the high of this one for even a second.---------------pre-reviewmy heartbeat has been elevated for like...3 straight hours.and that is very unusual because i do not work out.review to come / 4.5 stars---------------tbr reviewWAY behind on my dark academia quotas. i'm going to lose my Allowed To Be Pretentious And Everyone Finds It Charming badge
2526253759	yet another reread and its good to know that dark academia is still my preferred aesthetic.____________________________________this book! this book! my kingdom for this book!this is absolutely sensational, a true work of brilliance. i am so enamoured by this story and everything it has to offer. its quite clever and beyond invigorating - the type of book that fully immerses you whilst reading it. the passion which radiates throughout this story makes me feel so in love with shakespeare and his words (and i honestly never considered myself a fan). the way in which these students dedicate their lives to studying him is almost romantic, in a way. how they integrate his language into their own interactions, making their own lives a work of poetry in the process, is very inspiring. and because of that, i would say the characters are the main focus for me. yes, there is a mystery/thriller element that surrounds the students, but i feel like that takes a backseat to what are phenomenal characters, the boys in particular. i became so enthralled with their lives, how they orbited one another, and just their day-to-day routines. and i should have known not to get so attached, as this story follows the form of a true shakespearean tragedy. so as i closed the final page, i found myself wistfully thinking that parting is such sweet sorrow.↠ 5 stars
4682944272	i am going to break my silence and speak my truth:this is the secret history for dummies with annoying theater majors and you can't convince me otherwise.if you're gonna very blatantly rip off what i consider one of the best novels ever written, at least do a good job of it. also, coming from someone who loves shakespeare to the point where she took four shakespeare courses during college, holy fuck were they unbearably annoying.it's like off brand the secret history meets glee.it had no nuance, no subtlety, nothing between the lines. it was basically a horrible caricature of the secret history. donna tartt, i'm so sorry that you got compared to this.
5887806811	3🌟I think this book is super fun, twisty, and dark if you're looking for that vibe then you should pick up this book Unfortunately I think I rated this book a little lower because of how heavily this book is inspired by shakespeare and the impact was lost on me since I know nothing about any of his work. I ended up looking up on reddit what the purpose of it all was and I feel that if I already had that knowledge then it would've def hit the way it was supposed to but it just unfortunately did not. However, I did love the ending and spent over an hour on Reddit pondering what the ending meant and now I need a novella pls
2440521953	Uhm.. this was boring? And maybe I'm uncultured or whatever but my god all of those Shakespeare quotes annoyed the hell out of me. I didn't care for any of the characters, I didn't care for the plot and I didn't care who the murderer was (and if we're being honest, there wasn't even really a mystery here. I don't know if some stuff was supposed to be shocking or not, but it definitely was not thrilling) I was bored out of my mind.(And what's with those weird comments Oliver made about his sisters eating disorder??)
1976227804	As someone who’s not familiar with theatre plays, I still enjoyed reading this book regardless. I’m sure theatre lovers will pick up all the nuances and appreciate it more, but it’s a fun ride with all the murder and melodrama, and I could still tell that much of the narrative mirrored plays that the characters were performing and quoting. There was a lot of building tension and intrigue throughout the story, though I felt the plot twist and the murder’s identity were predictable.

2749956066	5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺 “We felt all the passions of the characters we played as if they were our own. But a character’s emotions don’t cancel out the actor’s – instead you feel both at once.” I can’t even express how upset I am to see how underrated this book is. Like, how the fuck??This is such a good book; I’ve been obsessed with it for at least a week straight and even though I felt the urge to devour it, I didn’t want it to end so fast so I had to slow down and enjoy. You know what happened when I did that? I truly enjoyed it. If We Were Villains is part of this dark academia aesthetics that has a soothing place in my heart. So, of course, I fell in love with it. I mean, how couldn’t I? I am a natural-born drama queen, I feed on theatrical stuff like this, do you expect me not to fell in love with a bunch of college kids aspiring to become actors?You are terrible wrong if your answer was yes. Because I delight in drama. (Telenovelas might have a say to that but uhm, who can say for sure?)This book is a mystery-crime story and it debuts in the life of seven theatre students after one of them dies (quite tragically).I honestly can feel the pertinence of this group. They really look like real-life people whom you might get acquainted with at some point in life. I love their dynamics as a group, but I have different feelings for each of them.- Oliver is one of my favourites and, it seems, the protagonist of the book; he’s always the sidekick, always the nice guy with a good heart; always loyal; he could do anything for those whom he loves; and he does; how could one not love him?- James is another favourite of mine; he’s always the good guy, the hero, the one with a noble heart; he’s definitely a Prince Charming and honestly, my heart just melts for him; but even the best of people have their demons talking in their ears and James is honestly fighting his demons – desperately; “Instead he was handsome the way you think of the devil as handsome – forbiddingly so.” - Filippa is the only one of the three girls of the group whom I actually love; she’s always seen as the extra – she is too volatile to fit into a category so that gives her the ability to play many roles, on- and offstage; Beware of the ones who seldom speak because they are the ones who held many secrets and truths;- Alexander is a freakshow really, a junkhead and definitely the villain of the story, but he might be the one you’ll go to when you want to forget about your worries; he exudes this calmness that you cannot grasp, but you definitely need in life;- Wren is such a weird character, it was a bit hard for me to love her; I liked her enough but there was something unpleasant about her that I just couldn’t place and so I have no developed opinion about her; she seems, somehow, too unstable, fragile; the ingénue of the group maybe;- Meredith is definitely the temptress, the femme fatale; she’s the she-devil of the story, tempting everyone with her perfect figure like she’s some sort of sexual goddess walking on Earth amongst mortals; I, for once, didn’t like her almost at all; even though I sometimes felt sorry for her, I only saw her as being fake first of all to herself and then to the other around her; I wanted to like her, but I couldn’t, she was lying to herself and she only played with the others to make herself feel better;- Richard is the tyrant and the only character that I truly despised from the beginning; no matter how talented you are, what a promising rising star you might be, if you’re not a decent human being, then you’re nothing; and Richard is absolutely disgusting as a day-to-day person and I couldn’t like him in any way. “Actors are by nature volatile—alchemic creatures composed of incendiary elements, emotion and ego and envy. Heat them up, stir them together, and sometimes you get gold. Sometimes disaster.” From the moment six of them discover the body of the seventh, an unforgiving road leading to self-depreciation opens up before all of them. They slowly start to degrade, both morally and physically. They become unsettled and cold. They have to make decisions that might alter their lives forever. They start making decisions no one has to make in life.This book is terribly deep if you really pay attention to everything that’s happening. It warns you about abuse, about obsession, about death and about the decisions we can make avoid certain situations; it is about what love looks like – it might be a friend, it might be a sister, it might be loyalty, in the end.This book talks about love, either desperate, hopeless, mad or even platonic love. Impossible love. It talks about sacrifice and whatever it is that leads one to do it. It talks about the fine line that stands between real and not real in the life of troubled, artistic and wild souls.This book is beautiful. Like, truly beautiful. And if you got a chance to read it, then read it with your mind and heart open, not only with your eyes. Because there is so much more to it than simply words.In the end, it doesn’t matter you enjoy the drama, because everything turns into a careful tragic masterpiece with no chance of changing its ending.I honestly fell in love with this. You might too. “But that is how a tragedy like ours or King Lear breaks your heart – by making you believe that the ending might still be happy, until the very last minute.”
3257467579	Jesus Christ. Where do I start? I guess I’ll begin by saying that I don’t give books a 1 star rating often. I think what makes me angry more than anything is that this book has been praised in this community by so many who have seemed to turn a blind eye to the blatant slut-shaming and sexism that seems to pop up relentlessly. I’ve seen few female characters written more poorly than Meredith. In the beginning of the story, all of the classmates are asked to share their biggest insecurities. Merediths is that she doesn’t want to just be seen as beautiful, sexy- she doesn’t want her body to cause people to overlook her personality and intelligence. ALL THE AUTHOR DID was comment on her body, any time the poor girl appears, speaks or moves! Literally every. time. the. poor. girl. appears. It’s all about how sexy and irresistible she is. The author reduces her down to her looks, her sex appeal, how she uses her body to get what she wants. Apparently that’s all she’s good for. Personality? Feelings? What are those? She’s slut shamed multiple times (at one point our main character Oliver states that they’ve all called her a slut at some point in time) as are others (Oliver’s sister makes a comment about how she was the only girl at a party not wearing lingerie, bringing back the good old ‘I’m not like other girls’ trope). Don’t even get me started on the absolute shambles of an attempt at LGBT representation! What I was most surprised and disappointed by was that this was written by a woman. If you liked this book, great. I really wanted to. I skimmed the last 120 pages.
2686478682	I haven't read a single Shakespeare play... yet I enjoyed this quite a bit!Strong dark academia vibes (think The Secret History by Donna Tartt), great audiobook.
6379488472	Slayed!!!
2164783283	Character in book: eloquently quoting lines of *relatable* Shakespeare to my face-Me: YOU DOTH QUOTE TOO MUCH BITCH, please shut the fuck up!!! If anyone quoted more than five lines of Shakespeare to my face in every single conversation they've had with me.....you can bet it can definitely end in tragedy!!!!This was literally: The Secret History VS If We Were Villains, and obviously for me, the former wins with a BIG SLAP across the face against IWWV. I think on its bare bones, there wasn't much substance following the fact after we learn who was killed...which was pretty predictable in every sense. And murderer(s)? Equally pinned down. Call me a wizardry thriller enthusiast, I don't know but the fact that this was basically a lighter thriller and even more less mysterious counterpart than that of its successor before it- The Secret History....kind of ruined it for me I suppose. I would have to agree that this was waaayyy more accessible to the wider audience and less of pretentious of a read, which ironically, had more self awareness of its vast pretentiousness.

2532335601	“You can justify anything if you do it poetically enough.” This book is so haunting, so atmospheric, so gripping, and so perfect. And If you, too, love The Secret History by Donna Tartt then I recommend this book with every single bone in my body. Also, this is such a love letter to Shakespeare and all his work, so if you appreciate that I think you’ll also fall so head over heels for this story. I’m honestly not sure what I expected going into If We Were Villains, but it is now one of my favorite books of all time. This story follows seven very pretentious theater students, going to a very prestigious and private college. They moved to Ohio to go to the university from all over the world, but they really made a found family with each other, while all living in what they call the Castle on campus. But one night their life completely changes when they all come together on a decision that alters their fate. “Nothing mattered much after that morning. Our two souls—if not all six—were forfeit.” ➽ Richard - has a bad temper and is the “mean” one. ➽ Meredith - Richard’s girlfriend, and the “sexy vixen” type. ➽ Filippa - The “cool” one, in my opinion. Mysterious home life. My second favorite.➽ Alexander - Gay, grew up in foster care, and I believe is Latinx. Yet, is the “stoner” one. ➽ Wren - Richard’s cousin, and “the girl next-door” type. ➽ James - The best actor and our main protagonist’s roommate. I’d say the “popular” one. ➽ Oliver - Our main protagonist, who is nice, and who is sweet, and who just wants to keep the peace between his group of friends. Also, Oliver is totally pansexual and no one can change my mind on this. “My infatuation […] transcended any notion of gender.” Oliver is for sure the main character, and this book starts out with him getting out of prison ten years after the events of that frightful night. And he is finally telling the story of what actually happened. This book is also broken up in five acts, but we get to see the events of what really happened that night, a decade ago, and we get to see the ramifications of how that altered everyone’s lives in present day. “How tremendous the agony of unmade decisions.” And each act, to me, really highlights a different Shakespearean play, that really sets the tone for what is unfolding in that act. From A Midsummer Night's Dream, to Julius Caesar, to King Lear, to Romeo and Juliet, to so many more; the honoring, appreciation, and celebration are all there and it truly makes for a read like no other. This book is a love letter to theater. And this book is structured so perfectly, written so expertly, that I really think that R.L. Rio crafted something beyond genius. “It’s easier now to be Romeo, or Macbeth, or Brutus, or Edmund. Someone else.” Friends, I feel like this is a book that won’t be for everyone, but if it is for you then you will love it with the sum of your being. This was perfection for me, and completely made my October this year. If you’re looking for something haunting, and thrilling, and so very atmospheric, then please give If We Were Villains a try. And that last line? It is going to haunt me forever with its beautiful perfection.

5542176480	no, i do not understand Shakespeare at all and yes, i do want to make this book my entire personality. 🖤if we were villains is a masterpiece crafted from the worst and deepest of our human afflictions. slowly watching each character spiral downward due to their own desire, secrets, heartache, and passion was so painful. it was also beautiful, in a devastating way.the fact that this is a debut novel is astounding. m.l. rio’s writing will definitely not be for everyone, but i personally couldn’t turn the pages fast enough. i ate this up like it was my last meal.i want to be the cool girl who walks around with a worn, annotated copy of this book. i’m taking a pen to the text and doing some research next time i read this. ✍🏻✨ here’s some advice if you are intimidated by this book like i was: (i literally put this book off for years.)✨ • go into this knowing that it will take some brainpower — it is not a light, fast-paced read. this book is difficult in many ways (including the writing style and the content.) • set the mood with candles, coffee/tea, blankets, and take advantage of the gloomy/cold fall weather. this book will demand all of your attention, so get comfy and focused. (it helps that this book is set in autumn & winter) • don’t be afraid to skim the Shakespeare quotes (of which there are MANY) if you don’t understand them. don’t get too caught up if you’re confused… you’ll start to understand the scenes through context. :) • it's okay to press pause and try again later if you're not liking this one. as a mood reader, i had to be in the perfect mood for this book or it wouldn’t have hit the same. • please don’t be afraid to hate this book. disliking this book is not a reflection of your intelligence or ability as a reader. this book is not for everyoneit's safe to say i love this book with my entire being. reading dark academia in autumn is a special kind of literary drug. 🖤
2291859561	This is a great book for straight women with internalized misogyny and a fetish for gay men. It can only be a slight fetish, though, since most of the story is made up of a lifeless romance between an equally lifeless man and a woman with no personality aside from being attractive.As a gay person, the stereotype of the party animal, sexually deviant gay man was disgusting. He is given a substance abuse problem and no other personality traits. He is depicted as predatory to straight men, going so far as to tease his roommates that he might r*pe them if they don’t have a good enough time at a party.None of the characters are interesting, especially not the women. If I didn’t know better, I would have sworn a man wrote it with the way they were depicted. After finishing the book I can tell you nothing on their likes, hobbies, or desires, and I can barely piece together proper personalities for each of them.As for the plot, it is as predictable as it is dull. The gay-baiting throughout it is tasteless and calculated, surrounded by oblivious homophobia that Rio must have never thought twice about. The ending feels nearly insulting, providing a dangling “what if?” that MAYBE gay people MIGHT end up happy, but we will never know because Rio couldn’t be bothered to write anything remotely close to a gay relationship.I could write an essay on how disappointed I am, and I haven’t even scratched the surface on all the slurs and insulting scenarios there are. This isn’t a book by a storyteller, this is a book by someone who wanted to make something famous by cutting and pasting recipes from different tropes and ending up with something that shouldn’t be touched.

The way it was all put together was pure genius.The structure of this book is really well put together as it is split into five 'acts' instead of the usual 'parts. These acts follow a similar formula to a Shakespeare play, these being:Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action and Denouement.There was much more of a mystery aspect than I was expecting. I would not go so far as to call it a thriller, but there was a definite eerie, who-done-it vibe. I was thoroughly invested in the story and all of the characters the entire time. And the ending.It broke my heart but in a good way and it probably boosted this book another star for me“𝙒𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙬𝙚 𝙗𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙚 𝙨𝙪𝙘𝙝 𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙥𝙚𝙤𝙥𝙡𝙚?” “𝙈𝙖𝙮𝙗𝙚 𝙬𝙚’𝙫𝙚 𝙖𝙡𝙬𝙖𝙮𝙨 𝙗𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙡𝙚.” Even though there was a lot of Shakespeare lines and plays intermixed, I still felt like it was readable and didn't confuse me at all about what was going on. It actually made me want to look up certain lines to see the context of them.

1969332082	"This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine." I have no words. I expected this to be good - there are so many exceptional reviews, I really hoped it would live up to its hype.Well, it did and more!7 drama students at an Elite Arts University are in their final year. They are as close as 7 people can be, they fight, they love and above it all they are obsessed with the works of Shakespeare (bear this in mind if you don't like Shakespeare as there are loads of quotes and sections in here).Oliver - Our main protagonist, describes himself as the least talented of the group. The most ordinary.James - Oliver's room mate and best friend, they have been inseparable for the last four years.Meredith - The vixen. Described constantly as this impossibly attractive woman, no man is immune. Every part she has ever played has invoked this sexual aura she seems to have.Richard - Dating Meredith. The absolute epitamy of the shortened version of his name (aka Dick). I hated this guy with a passion, he is arrogant, rude and violent. He usually gets the main part in every show they put on.Wren - Richard's cousin, a delicate flower. Another reviewer described her as 'the girl next door' which I think is a good description for her.Filippa - A bit mysterious. She never reveals her home life, keeps mainly to herself but she is fiercely loyal to the others.The book opens with Oliver about to leave prison after a decade, serving time for murder. Detective Colborne - the police officer who arrested Oliver, has never really believed his story. Now he is about to retire, he asks Oliver if he will finally tell the truth about what really happened all those years ago.We are swept up into the students' world of parties, drugs, obsessions and secrets. And honestly? It is so addictive - there is this underlying theme of darkness, we know something bad is going to happen, it's just a matter of when.The ending wasn't quite the twist I was hoping for. But then again, it had to be someone so there couldn't really have been any other ending without it becoming unrealistic, so I think it was done well. I was also heartbroken when (view spoiler)[ Filippa tells Oliver that James' committed suicide a few years before - he couldn't handle the guilt anymore. Though the final page does leave the possibility that maybe he didn't die? Potentially. I like that idea (hide spoiler)]Overall, I thought this was fantastic, and I highly recommend it. Murder mystery mixed in with the drama of the theatre and the passion of Shakespeare. What's not to love? "When we first walked through those doors, we did so without knowing that we were now part of some strange fanatic religion where anything could be excused so long as it was offered at the altar of the Muses. Ritual madness, ecstasy, human sacrifice. Were we bewitched? Brainwashed? Perhaps." ************************************************So this book just ruined me. I’m going to need much time to recover from this.

The dénouement of the storyline was translucent from the very first lines of Act I prologue; the epilogue was going to embrace a tragic and melodramatic ending that would—in a way—flourish wither from the ashes of a modern shakespearean, passionate plot-line. "The moral outrage we should have suffered was quietly put down, surpassed like an unpleasant rumor before it had a chance to be heard. Whatever we did—or, more crucially, did not do— it seemed that so no so long as we did it together, our individual sins might be abated. There is no comfort like complicity." M.L Rio’s plume is without contest deadly addictive. While reading and trying to dissect every complex character encountered during the course of this insane retelling, we keep swaying between hate and love, frustration and compassion. We question the gravity of their actions and the sanity of their thoughts. However, we don’t quite lose hope or faith on their souls. The obnubilating —unanswered— questions that were creeping like a sword of Damocles over the heads of our 7 talented characters; kept the story enticing and the obsession to satisfy the "unknown" alive. Who was the culprit? What was the triggering event that derived the trajectory of their promising futures into a grayer one, painting them as criminals, liars and void bodies? "The thing about Shakespeare is, he’s so eloquent… He speaks the unspeakable. He turns grief and triumph and rapture and rage into words, into something we can understand. He renders the whole mystery of humanity comprehensible." I stop. Shrug. "You can justify anything if you do it poetically enough." The more we dive into the story the more the plot has a bitter connotation in how their subjective commun love for Shakespeare shadowed and blinded any other nuance of their lives. A ridiculous connotation in how their obsession drove them to play their own melancholic Scenes in their own gory and tragic Acts. A laughable connotation in how what reunited them once was the main factor that divided them at the end.~~~I think what made me love this read so much is because i was sharing every thought and question, suspicion with my loves. The experience was without any doubt ten times better than if i have read this beast —full of Shakespeare rep and references — alone. Im glad it was as an educating as an addicting read. STILL THINKING IT’S A MACBETH FANFIC THO!!!! ~~ Quotes :"Surprising. After all, Shakespeare is poetry—most of it, anyway— and there’s a certain mathematical pattern to poetry, isn’t there?""I’m afraid," she said, after what felt like a year , speaking very slowly, "that I’m prettier than I’m talented or intelligent, and that because of that no one will ever take me seriously. As a person or a performer.""You think it was Macbeth that fucker us up?""No." She stops at a red light and glances at me. "I think we were all fucked up from the start.""Nothing about her had ever seen it simple, but she was, then. Simple and close and beautiful.

2175517149	I thought I'd never be done with this book. For a mystery wrapped in Shakespearean theatre If We Were Villains was exceptionally dull. I love theatre as a devoted audience member, and I love The Bard with all my heart, yet I could not stand another minute of this pretentious pile of garbage. Honestly, why not list Shakespeare as your co-author - he only wrote like 30% of the novel for you? The students of the super elite Shakespearean school featured as the main cast were not only super special, "quoting Bard just for fun in regular conversation" snowflakes, they were crème de la crème among their peers too. How am I supposed to feel any connection or sympathy for these pretentious douches anyway? Most of them weren't just type-cast by their teachers, but also their author too. They didn't even bother to step out of their designated roles of "the jerk", "the gay guy", "the sensitive wunderkind", "the nice guy with no real talent to be in the position he is in", "the waif", "the vixen", and "the girl nobody cares about". They were flat and boring, and really hard to route for. Most of them acted to fit the plot, instead of behaving like rational human beings. What was Dick's problem anyway? Gawd, I wanted to commit a murder against all of these people by the second act!Nothing happened in the entire book except repetitive reenactions of various plays by Shakespeare. The author made sure to indulge in every detail of this theatrical "excitement", describing precisely how I was supposed to feel like through the reactions of the nameless freshmen and sophomores watching this crap. There were pointless acting lessons that added nothing to the story, but bulk. It felt very masturbatory, considering the author herself is a so-called "theatre kid". The main intrigue of the novel had to wait till practically half-way through the book, and even then it was quite lacklustre. I honestly could care less about the murder victim or how the killing actually went down. In fact it was rather clear who the culprit was pretty early on - some mystery. Great language use, but the boring plot and insufferable characters killed any enjoyment I could have received from a literary thriller.
1945576194	until the ending, this was probably going to be a three star from me. a high three on the three-star spectrum, but a three nonetheless. it held my interest, but i think this one will resonate more with theater-kids than it did for me, because of how firmly entrenched it is in that world. rio makes it accessible to regular folk, but it probably helps to have a soft place in your heart for young actors and the things that drive them, and i’m someone impatient with affectation both in life and in my reading, so the characters were frequently more grating than charming to me. they’re definitely convincing for who they are, but i never warmed to any of them or felt sympathetic towards them - i’ve certainly known people like this in my life, but it’s exhausting to be confronted with seven of them at once, all posturing and pretentious banter, where conversations are on-the-nose passages from shakespeare’s plays shot back-and-forth, displaying the characters' education, not necessarily their personality. i’m with the detective (the first speaker) in this scene:”So,” he says. “How much of what you told me about that night was true?”“All of it,” I say, “in one way or another.”A pause. “Are we going to play this game?””Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true,” I say.“I thought they would have beaten that bullshit out of you in prison.”“That bullshit is all that kept me going.” One thing I’m sure Colborne will never understand is that I need language to live, like food - lexemes and morphemes and morsels of meaning nourish me with the knowledge that, yes, there is a word for this. Someone else has felt this before.“Why don’t you just tell me what happened? No performance. No poetics.”“For us, everything was a performance.” A small, private smile catches me off guard and I glance down, hoping he won’t see it. “Everything poetic.”Colborne is quiet for a moment and then says, “You win. Tell it your way.”to backtrack, this book is a variant on The Secret History theme - it features seven theater students in their fourth year at a very elite arts college whose discipline is strictly shakespeare. they live together in an appropriately dramatic castle-like structure, slightly off the main campus - inseparable from each other, isolated from 'normal' people, and constantly immersed in tragedies filled with feuds, vengeance, and casual murders. further complications result from the particulars of the actor’s temperament:”A good Shakespearian actor - a good actor of any stripe, really - doesn’t just say words, he feels them. We all felt the passions of the characters we played as if they were our own. But a character’s emotions don’t cancel out the actor’s - instead you feel both at once. Imagine having all your own thoughts and feelings tangled up with all the thoughts and feelings of a whole other person. It can be hard, sometimes, to sort out which is which.”considering this perfect storm of elements, it’s not surprising when life and art get blurred and one of them ends up dead. but is it the result of an accident or murrrrrderrrr? the events of that night are murky, but our verbiage-spouting narrator oliver marks confessed to the murder and has spent the past ten years in jail. his release coincides with the retirement of detective colborne, the lead investigator in the case, and oliver is ready to tell colborne exactly what happened that night. his way.the story is split between oliver ‘now,’ returning to the scene of the crime with colborne, and the story of everything that went on in this cult-like group ten years ago; of a group of people obsessed with shakespeare whose relationships with each other were as complicated as any tragedy - resentments and rivalries, sexual dalliances, unrequited longing, blood relatives and lovers, straight and gay, addictions and insecurities and the fine line between acting and lying, onstage combat and real-life consequences.it’s a debut, so there’s some first-timer clumsiness in terms of exposition - the first chapter, introducing all the players is kind of tedious, but it definitely picks up once it gets over the basic stage-setting. the scenery-chewing shakespeare stuff is a bit indulgent; shakespeare ends up doing a lot of the narrative work in what is often a pretty straightforward story, if you’ve read a lot of The Secret History type books, but there’s one interesting spin on the story: usually the narrator in these books takes the ‘outsider looking in’ role, typically separated from the group at large because of a lower socio-economic status, but in this case - yes, oliver is much less well-off than most of his peers, but i think each of the characters could claim outsider status for one reason or another, and the group is less cohesive than The Secret History norm (although it does mirror the character checklist of two (view spoiler)[possibly incestuous (hide spoiler)] relatives; cousins, not twins, one gay male, and one major asshole)it's a good read; if you're a The Secret History readalike addict like me, it's not going to blow your mind, but it's entertaining, and i did really like the little turn at the end. it opens up a lot of questions about what will happen next, but it was a nice little surprise in a story i thought had already ended. three and a half rounded up, and i will gladly read anything else she writes.come to my blog!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>

1937759825	well this is my favorite book of this year so far. also I feel attacked by that ending
4957248767	Ahhh I'm honestly SO conflicted on what to rate this book. On the one hand, it is SO well written👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 but on the other hand it was so sad😭 I wish there were more happy parts in it but that's just a personal thing because I think I've come to realize that I prefer happy/escapism books. Overall such a unique and well written read!!
4746481365	— 3.5 stars★ “You can justify anything, if you do it poetically enough.” Seven friends bound by the same passion and one secret that will change all their lives. I don´t think I will ever recover from this ending. My head feels so empty. I still don't know what to say. But one thing is for sure the ending made up for all the misery I went through while reading🤣This was so utterly well written, the foreshadowing, the character development and plot everything was so good M.L Rio has really outdone the job. The way this book made all my emotions come up from frustration to driving me insane and being sad. This was actually crazy.It didn´t really start good for me cuz act one already made me want to rip all my hair of my head and make me assume that this was gonna be a 1 or 2 star rating. It was just really boring. I was ready to fight the people who told me this was gonna be amazing UNTIL the last scene of act 1. That's where things started to get more interesting and where I slowly got dragged into the story line.But even after this I felt like it still wasn't enough. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong but I just didn't love it the way I had secretly hoped for especially since this has been on my TBR for such a long ass time. I also think my lack of knowledge about Shakespeare and especially Macbeath had played a role in this and made it a bit harder for me to get into this book. But you know I eventually got there and still enjoyed it. This book right here deserves the award for the best quotes ever.here are some of my favs: “But that is how a tragedy like ours or King Lear breaks your heart—by making you believe that the ending might still be happy, until the very last minute.”“It seemed that so long as we did it together, our individual sins might be abated. There is no comfort like complicity.”“So what do you do? Ignore your grief, or indulge it? But maybe every day we let grief in, we’ll also let a little bit of it out, and eventually we’ll be able to breathe again.”“For someone who loved words as much as I did, it was amazing how often they failed me.” ---------This last epilogue has just blown me away, and literally made me tear up. I don´t know what to say and how to describe my feelings atm, so RTC! “Who alone suffers suffers most in the mind Leaving free things and happy shows behind: But then the mind much sufferance doth o`er skip, When grief hath mates, and bearing felowship.” --------Getting ready for a very ✨chaotic, messy but fun✨ BR.This BR is with 14 people i think so wish me (us) luck, this is going to be something😭
5237908005	“You think it was Macbeth that fucked us up?”“No. I think we were all fucked up from the start.” you got that right 🤧this book truly made me unlock parts of my brain i didn’t even know existed. after my awful the secret h*story experience, i honestly went into this expecting to hate it since everyone compares the two. but i—no one is more surprised than me—ended up finding one of my favourite reads so far this year! m.l. rio did an exquisite job with this one. it’s extremely well written and leaves you so on edge the whole way through. it’s such a fast-paced, mind-blowing read. never a dull moment. “We’re afraid of looking foolish if we reveal the full force of our emotions. But in Shakespeare’s world, passion is irresistible, not embarrassing.”if you told 15 year old me she would be reading a book filled with shakespeare for fun, she would laugh in your face. but…here i am. this book is making me wanna go and read all of shakespeare’s work. this author must have put some mind altering substance in these words. i was sitting there researching the plots and meaning of the plays in the book and the way i was eating it up and couldn’t get enough. i’m shook. ”For us, everything was a performance. Everything poetic.”i need to do a reread to dissect this book in more details because i already know there are so many little hidden eggs that tie back to the plot that i didn’t pick up on. i highly recommend this book and to read it with others. it made the experience so much more enjoyable picking each others brains, and everyone noticing different details and connecting different plot points back to previous scenes. thank you to all my bookish besties for coming on this wild journey with me! we had so much fun when we weren’t yelling at each other to catch up <33 quotes: “Actors are by nature volatile—alchemic creatures composed of incendiary elements, emotion and ego and envy.

4087758176	i love you oliver but you put the bar for "practical intelligence and getting yourself out of trouble" in hell
5997514664	➵ 3.5 ✰ 💐- spoiler-free review but also shorter than usual! 💌 🌷₊⊹ # “fourth year. the year of tragedy.” for a debut novel, this was really well-written and impressive. there's so many aspects of the book that i loved from the character dynamics to the incredible foreshadowing used. i can see why it's loved by many and it honestly deserves all the love it has. i loved how it started but as it went on it became one of those books that i like but not enough for me to constantly think about it.these are the two main reasons why:1. richard's "sudden" outburst. don't get me wrong, i absolutely loved the shift in dynamics after his sudden outburst. but it's a little odd that they were so close during the first three years of school and this suddenly happens in the last year out of the blue? maybe not so out of the blue because he is described as someone who has a big ego and someone who is really full of himself but maybe it's because we didn't get to see their dynamic between the first three years that it just felt out of place for me. i feel like if he was that bad - which he definitely was - then why didn't they do something about it sooner? it was just something that i couldn't stop thinking about while reading the rest of the book and maybe i just missed something and i'm completely wrong.2. the ending. i won't be talking about it in detail because this is a spoiler-free review but it was a little disappointing, to say the least. this is a little bit more of a personal preference but i hate open endings. i hate still having questions after i finish a book. so the open ending just took all the emotional build-up from the epilogue and threw it away. it made the emotional impact disappear which ultimately left me disappointed. instead, i was left with new questions that are unanswered.⤿ overall . . . this was such a fun experience and i loved the writing style. the found family aspect is one of my favourites. i definitely understand why so many people love this book. once you get into it, this is definitely a page-turner. i'm excited to see what m.l. rio has planned for future works because her writing style is amazing.⊹ “do you blame shakespeare for any of it?”‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎"i blame him for all of it."⊹ “when did we become such terrible people?”‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎"maybe we’ve always been terrible."# all reviews are opinions of my own and you should experience a book before giving your own. happy reading! 💌₊˚ ────── ୨୧ pre-review ୨୧ ────── ˚₊all was well until that ending because WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?i said i wanted slow-burn but this was all burn ☹️rtc maybe? idk i'm very distraught
6989294477	4 stars "You can justify anything if you do it poetically enough." I enjoyed this book so much—this was actually my first true dark academia book. I've read books with dark academia vibes, but nothing can come close to the experience of a full dark academia novel written like this. I found the atmosphere and intellectual richness of this book incredibly exciting. I love books that have my brain working as they make you take in the layers of the plot, the foreshadowing, and implications. I can only give this 4 stars since, despite finding this read rewarding after finishing, I feel like being more familiar with Shakespeare's works before reading would have enhanced this experience even more.This book follows Oliver Marks leaving ten years of imprisonment for a murder he may or may not have committed. The setting is an elite arts college, with Oliver and six other students living Shakespeare every day. When one of them dies, the line between the story played out on stage and the lives lived by the seven students becomes deconstructed. The outlook of the characters reveals profound questions of who we think we are, the path we take to achieve what we want, and the consequences that arise in a world where acting is being and being is acting.This book is the kind you would want to start over again as soon as you finish to pick up all the clues and references that eventually lead to the end. I like how it made me really pay attention to the little things, and I think the complexity of that truly makes the experience of the book so much more exciting. "When did we become such terrible people?" "Maybe we've always been terrible." One of the things that I found especially interesting was how the characters of Shakespeare's plays occupied, and sometimes skewed, their identities. They seemed to literally slip into their parts, which made it hard to tell where the acting ended and where the person began—I thought this was such a cool thing to read about.The way this book had me asking questions regarding identity and persona was fascinating. I kept wondering: Do we take on the roles that define us, or do we define the roles? These questions generated a really fascinating dynamic amongst the characters, and I loved seeing their personalities evolve throughout.The writing in this book I'd describe as between flowery and sophisticated, without veering into incomprehensibility—as I had kind of feared since this book surrounds Shakespeare, I was worried the writing would be hard for me to understand. I loved how the atmosphere was described; it felt very rich and immersive, and I think the author really established the dark, tense tone that permeated the entire story.That being said, I did have a few issues with the book. I haven't read much Shakespeare, only a couple of plays back in high school, so I wasn't able to fully appreciate all the references and deeper meanings woven into the story. I still think it's accessible to those unfamiliar with Shakespeare, but I do feel that knowing his works would enhance the experience. I definitely gained a greater appreciation for Shakespeare after reading this, and I'm sure a reread would reveal even more layers, especially if I dive into his plays beforehand.Another small issue I had was with Richard's character. I found his sudden outbursts of violence hard to understand. He had such a close relationship with the others during the first few years of school, but then his behaviour suddenly shifts, and the book never fully explores why. Maybe I missed something in terms of the Shakespearean aspect that might have contributed to his character, but I kept wondering about this unexplained change throughout the book. The fact that it was never addressed left me a bit unsatisfied.Lastly, the open ending left me feeling a little underwhelmed. While I can appreciate open endings in some books, in this one, I was really craving closure—I'm not too sure why. The buildup throughout the story made me want to know definitively what happened, and the ambiguity at the end didn't quite hit for me, but that is very much a personal issue.Bottom line, this book was truly an incredibly engaging read! I think it's a perfect choice for anyone who loves dark academia and literary thrillers.What made this experience even better was reading it with Hoda—discussing theories with her made it so much more fun 💞

4667401283	Took me too long to make a review but here we are.Reading This book was a bad experience for me.FOR ME.I finished it and I'm still to this day looking for the plot but finding none.So this group of theater actors , trying to move on with their lives. Because they saw a man (who used to abuse and torment them all the time) dying and did nothing to save him. I was like oh that's cool, let's see. But nothing happened like really nothing. Even their dialogues they don't talk normally they just quote Shakespeare. Not to mention I didn't understand anything they say. I get that, that was the point theater and acting and stuff but still. I couldn't connect with the characters that way. It is my fault that I read this when I know nothing of Shakespeare but the tattoo on Aaron Warner's hip.I'm sorry to the people who liked this book, I think it's just me but I really hated the guts of this book.This book is having two stars because I actually liked James and oliver.𝗦𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀:I'm sorry what is that ending? I'm genuinely confused. Is James alive or something? 𝗣𝗿𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱:I'm finally reading this 🥱
5457365936	"'This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeit of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars … as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc’d obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting-on!'"this speech from king lear, one of shakespeare's greatest tragedies, claims that because of how man indulges their own evils and forces the blame of this indulgence onto self-created disasters or other innocent happenings, it then seems to them that this evil is inherent and unavoidable, cyclically continuing the indulgence.the novel is it's namesake for a reason.4.25/5 stars.yes, this was the big buddy read. much love to: aliki, anmol, hanna, lila, lilyya, lulu, mahek, maya, vee, rae, vio, and youssra. i will write this without spoilers in the beginning, but there will come a time when they are there and more importantly you will need character context to appreciate it so if you haven't read it yet- leave when i tell you to. but stay for now.i'll start with the few things i didn't like because i definitely an mention those without spoilers:1. the foreshadowing. i'm all for creating tension and atmosphere, and while it was successfully atmospheric, it was in excess. i kept finding myself reading phrases like "but as we know that didn't work out" or "but i know better now" to end scenes which not only felt like a cheap way to create a sense of urgency, but was so overt it sounded like the internal monologue of an emo teenager. i could practically hear my chemical romance playing in the background.2. it honestly ran a little slow for me. i wasn't bothered or turned off by it, but was never really captured by the plot. the pacing was just not my thing.3. and ofc the primary reason it's not a 5 star rating: for a murder mystery, it just wasn't good. historically, i'm not a fan of a lot of mysteries and don't find myself reading them often, but if a mystery was written for me, this would be it. and that would be because it's less mystery and more lit fic. sure, it had murder and scandal and what have you, but it was terribly predictable. especially if you had prior knowledge in shakespeare's works or idk, googled, because then the plot points fell at your feet. it would be a 5 and a half star lit fic read, but it isn't, is it?now onto general things that i loved-1. all the shakespeare. yes. just yes. i want more. i was absolutely nerding out and had the best time decoding it and seeing all the little references rio entered.2. it feels like a classic. i absolutely love that something like this is not only bringing the feel of classics back to contemporary audiences, but is making shakespeare accessible and interesting where it hasn't been considered so before.3. the writing is visceral, poetic, and just lovely.now, the time has come: SPOILER ZONE, AKA CHARACTER ANALYSIS!if you haven't read it, whether you plan to or not, you better be scurrying right out of here. i will not be spoiler blocking them. scary, i know. run.now back to the previously quoted words of william, in which he lists the way in which people convince themselves of their evil in order to justify it. it tells a lot more about the book than one may realize. i am choosing to take this angle because it's not only my takeaway and what i think rio intended, but could easily be overlooked.it starts with, "we were villains on necessity," because many of the characters displayed villainy in some sense, and in their impaired mental state, doing things such as the murder of richard, covering that up, and the consequent actions, etc., can feel necessary to them.then, "fools by heavenly compulsion," because of love. or infatuation. or obsession. whatever you want to call it, they were all in love with shakespeare and the golden, romanticized, timeless alternative reality they were presented with. and you have richard, in love with the power he had over others. and you have meredith, in love with the love she received. and of course james and oliver, in love with each other. here i call it love, but this love is not the generally agreed upon definition of healthy (or at least mutually beneficial) love, instead it is synonymous with obsession, infatuation, addiction, and is wildly extreme. but this extremity is precisely what makes it seem special, overwhelming, otherworldly, or of "heavenly compulsion." and there's no doubt they were fools under such divine emotions.then, "knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance," because surely they acted in an unsavory manner, and why? because everyone else was: it's human nature. when everyone around you acts in such a way, this is your new normal, your new baseline, and it becomes infinitely easier to do the same.then, "drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc’d obedience of planetary influence," because, well, many were drunkards, all were liars, and many were adulterers. and why obedience enforced by planetary influence? of course astrology doesn't directly puppeteer their lives and it certainly doesn't enforce anything, but at this point, isn't it easier to assume that it does?and the speech closes with, "all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting-on!" because if you aren't able to blame the evil on the divine, how else are you meant to continue to perpetuate it? it's significantly easier to choose to indulge and call it determinism.but my biggest feeling on all of this is that i don't feel that any of them are "stupid" or "evil" in the slightest. in fact, i don't feel that i can judge them at all. because perhaps what i just outlined was merely the characters justifying their indulgence, but if it feels necessary to them, does that not then make it necessary?as oliver mentions, the situation that these students found themselves in was less devotion or study or anything, and more compatible with a cult. they were isolated from the outside world; they really only had each other and the bard, and spent years deeply immersed in and living by a fictional world that not only had rules very different to those in contemporary society, but existed in an incredibly extreme state.this shifts one's perception of "normal" to a significant degree, in a way only similar in our modern world to something like extreme religious views, cults, and instances with severe gaslighting.it's impossible to understand the incomprehensible mental consequences of a shift of this kind until you have experienced it.it is impossible to tell how you will react to having the foundation of your beliefs pulled from beneath your feet.i think this also explains the "love" (as previously defined) that they suffered from. nothing looks the same under these conditions and its foolish to act like it is.so do i think oliver was bad? or stupid? not in the slightest (except when he was bitching about having to pay for school (but even then i think that is less an example of privilege and more a case study on his detachment to reality)).nor do i think james or meredith or alexander or richard or gwendolyn was good or bad or evil or angelic. it's too complicated for those simplistic categorizations. and for that, i take my hat off to m. l. rio. "you can justify anything if you do it poetically enough." what can i say, it's a tragedy of shakespearean proportions.
1977179339	If The Secret History is Kobe beef then If We Were Villains is a microwavable Salisbury steak.This is a bastardized version of that far better novel.Also...Dear Rio, we get it: you studied Shakespeare.
4626413806	I just finished if we were villains a few days back and I am in absolute shock- it was amazing and all of you were absolutely right. The phenomenal and lucid prose is an absolute joy to read and I’m simply in love with the way ML Rio conveys the characters’ thoughts and motives. It’s dramatic, but moreover it’s theatric - and that’s exactly what I adore about it. The pretentious characters manage to not be completely despicable and the relationship between James and Oliver was one of the best I’ve ever read about - those final chapters delivered all the heartbreak indeed.If I would have to give any criticism about this it’d probably be the fact that most of the side characters were underdeveloped and one dimensional but it didn’t really bother my reading experience in any way.to all my theatre geeks and dark academia lovers out there THIS is the perfect book for you- please read it and come here and scream about it with me. I’m utterly obsessed with it.full review up on my blog ! https://randomreadersrambles.wordpres...
4846405074	y’all… i have so much to say yet i cannot figure how to put it into words? first of all i took notes reading this book just because i wanted to see if i could be on my detective shit and it was so much fun, i think it helped with my enjoyment of the book. that and i’ve read 3 of the shakespeare plays that they did (macbeth being my fav). i loved the characters and the story itself. i love how this was basically a shakespeare novel, like the tragedy of it all… a lot of shakespeare retellings usually just use him as inspiration but no this bitch really said i’m going to be in my shakespeare bag and she ate! i need her to write another book and quickly! i enjoyed the friend group so much. it’s so hard for me to connect to found families that are already established but the author did such an amazing job at showing their dynamic’s individually and together. it was just so good and the ending? omg 😭 so happy i own the first edition so i don’t have to search through the depths of hell looking for one.
3816381398	i didn’t miss their red flags. i saw them and thought they were funny.
3779348751	5/5 “You can justify anything if you do it poetically enough.” This was so perfect and my heart is broken. Gosh. When I was hearing about this book, the two things that hooked me in were dark academia (an aesthetic more books need) and how it’s essentially a love letter to Shakespeare and words in general. After reading, I can confirm both things are true, and I can also say if you’re heart isn’t ripped out by the end you can’t be human. Actors are by nature volatile—alchemic creatures composed of incendiary elements, emotion and ego and envy. Heat them up, stir them together, and sometimes you get gold. Sometimes disaster. To start off, I shall examine each main character, because I have so many thoughts on them all. Oliver Marks: The Loyal Sidekick The main character, Oliver, is so amazing. I love him. He does everything out of love and deserves better. I don’t want to spoil anything but let me just say he did not deserve ten years in prison, although he was somewhat guilty.His character is very contemplative and loves literature, and also understands human emotions quite well. He overall is an amazing MC and I loved him. James Farrow: The Hero I said no spoilers so I’ll just have to scream into the void. HE DESERVED BETTER. And honestly, 6 out of the 7 main actors deserved better so it may not give much away but my god-I love James. From the first interaction between him and Oliver I just knew he was going to be a character I would fall in love with. And I can’t stress enough how much this poor boy went through. He deserved better. He deserved love.And the end- Alexander Vass: The Villian Ahh Alex! He was honestly hilarious. I feel sad for him too because of his addiction, and I truly believe he deserved better. He was a character that was sort of uncertain about everything yet confident, and I feel he could have and more development but the lack of it gave him a mysterious aura. Richard Stirling: The Tyrant I hate this boy so much. I hate him. I can’t express how much I wish he had never taken up acting and Shakespeare. If you couldn’t guess from his regular stage role, he’s a tyrant. And not a good one. He is controlling and it only gets worse as the book goes on. He is very unlikable and I hate him. But that is how a tragedy like ours or King Lear breaks your heart—by making you believe that the ending might still be happy, until the very last minute. Filippa Kosta: The Chameleon Hmm so we didn’t get much of her. I think, again, based on her role this was intentional. In fact, if we look at the book as a whole, the roles they usually played match up perfectly and I so wish they didn’t.Pip overall was a good friend to Oliver and I think she was truly a genuine person, so there’s that. She was a lifeline for him, in a way. Meredith Dardenne: The Femme Fatale Okay so I dislike and like Meredith. Do I think she deserves happiness? Yes. I just was conflicted by her character. Again, I’m sure this was the intention. I just could’ve completely like her. She was very interesting though. Wren Stirling: The Ingénue She was again, not the most focused character. Although I overall did like her and I think she is a very cool character. I can see how everyone’s actions affected her and overall did enjoy her:) Which of us could say we were more sinned against than sinning? We were so easily manipulated - confusion made a masterpiece of us. The plot is amazing. We have some chapters in present time, but most are in the past, showing how we got to Oliver just coming out of prison. I was consistently guessing over what happens and I was shocked at the end. And the epilogue, you say? Well I think it ended as a sign of hope for meeting in another life- in heaven. But it ended in tragedy, that much I believe to be true. And that what breaks my heart most. It’s not the whole truth. The whole truth is, I’m in love with him still. The truth is, the romance in this book was tragic. How they only discovered their feelings and could admit them when they were apart. How they loved each other so much that it lead them down a disastrous path. I can’t say who the couple is, because I truly think it is something that you can guess but seeing it unfold in the book is beautiful. Their interactions had me screaming, the blushes and trust the had in each other.Why must authors break my heart? Per aspera ad astra. I’d heard a variety of translations, but the one I liked best was Through the thorns, to the stars. Overall I recommend this book to absolutely everyone and I would love to discuss to if any of my friends do read this. It’s all worth it, having your heart shredded. I promise:)2nd time reading: I’m crying again why did I do this to myself. The foreshadowing in this novel is literally insane and the implications of even the roles they get into the play and how those feed into their eventual fates…. such a masterpiece and I’m crying over James and Oliver once again <3 3rd time reading: so back over winter break I decided to fully analyze and annotate the book and nearly every page has something underlined. Literally every sentence has a specific meaning and the characters are so well written and I shall never get over this masterpiece. One of my favourite books ever. And yes! I cried again :) 4th time reading: this book knows me at a molecular level 5th time reading: I forgot how fucking sad the end of this book is. God. What a masterpiece. “The things about Shakespeare is, he's so eloquent...he speaks the unspeakable. He turns grief and triumph and rapture and rage into words, into something we can understand. He renders the whole mystery of humanity comprehensible.”
4532185743	i RARELY put books onto my all time favourites shelf but ohmygod i knew within the first chapter that this would make the cut! the story, the characters, the slow descent into madness 👌🏼👌🏼 it’s everything i wanted and morealso, coming from someone who isn’t a shakespeare fanatic and tbh finds it quite difficult to understand the old timey language of the plays, it was very easy to follow alongi was also very satisfied with the ending, well no, i was actually devastated… but i mean it was a sad but great ending which made the whole thing that much more painful 😊 woo hoo
1979088606	*Update - 2018*Because I still think about this book almost a year after reading it, I'm moving it to my favorite's shelf. I think it's deserving there, right alongside The Secret History and Vicious.___________________________________4.25-4.5/5 Stars This was breathtakingly brilliant. Honestly, if this book isn't on your to-be-read list, it needs to be. It starts off shaky (at least it did to me), however, once it grabs your attention - it will not let go.Now, where do I even start? Should I start with how layered these characters are? (Though, I will say, I noticed the female characters could've used more depth). Should I begin with how flawlessly Rio tied in multiple Shakespearean plays into the actual plot? Or maybe, I should talk about the mystery/tension intertwined with everything that occurs throughout this novel? You know what? I'm going to ramble.So. This story revolves around 7 students who are majoring in Shakespearean Studies & Acting (something like that) - and from the beginning you realize that this degree and school is no joke. It's competitive. Serious. Cut throat. Which makes it all the more intriguing. It wouldn't be half as good of a story if it took place at a "nicer school."Getting right to it, I loved how every character had something going for them. Though, at first, it was difficult remembering who was who, and it sometimes bothered me that I couldn't picture anyone. However, those things hardly deterred me from continuing (surprisingly). The plot and depth of the characters made up for everything else. So don't be fooled and think that these characters are just your "shallow" sort of college students. In some ways, they might be. However, they're much more.Something else that I LOVED, was the strange/strong relationship between James and Oliver. When I was reading, I kept on wondering why the heck I wanted them to end up together. Quite badly, too. I mean, by all appearances they were just friends. Plus, Oliver was head-over-heals for Meredith. And yet, I couldn't help but feel that while he lusted after Meredith, he had a very real passion for James. Just like Oliver himself says (towards the end), he himself had no idea what he and James were. Whatever it was, it was bloody brilliant.Unfortunately, this book didn't end up in my "all time favorites." I thought it would have. Really. However, when I looked at everything, there were some dull spats throughout the story. Plus, I couldn't ignore how most of the male characters had layered personalities, whereas the female characters seemed bland. (Except perhaps Meredith, she played a big role - but in a stereotypical way).Overall, I feel like I've given away too much - and not enough. I wish I could ramble more, but I feel like I'm not doing the story justice. I'll probably comes back and re-review this. In the meantime, get this book!
3269797970	Now this is what New Adult should be like! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼I had serious Dead Poets Society vibes here, I loved the dark academia atmosphere, with weird theatre kids haha. I’m neutral when it comes to Shakespeare. I didn’t attend traditional high school so I was never academically exposed to it, nor did I seek it out on my own. I don’t like Shakespeare nor hate it...I simply just don’t know Shakespeare...So in a way, I guess I was mildly intrigued by the heavy Shakespearean content and fanaticism in If we were Villains. I found the characters pretentious Shakespearean dialect to be endearing. And also it’s simple to just gloss over the nonsense if it’s not your thing. I freaking loved the narration here. Somewhere in between verse and prose, which seems like it could be problematic but, my god, this author, this is her debut and it’s freaking phenomenal!This. Is. The. Type. Of. New. Adult. I. Want! But can rarely find! The only other that comes to mind is Red, White and Royal Blue. (If you have similar recs to both of these titles, pleeeease share!) But the character relationships were what really held my attention rapt. And the mystery and intrigue of the plot was highly entertaining and frustrating and intense and confusing and I just freaking loved it, okay????? Okay. I switched between the audiobook and ebook on Scribd. Neither of these formats are my preferred way of reading, especially an audiobook, but I wanted to say that I felt the audio narrator on scribd did a superb job and is the best I’ve heard so far 👏🏼. I especially enjoyed his high voice for the female characters 😆....it was pretty darn good. 4/9/2020 *puts on big-girl panties and picks up an adult book* I can do this, right? *shaky sigh* I totally got this, I’m 34 and I can read and enjoy an adult book, right?
4135011080	I would go as far as saying that M. L. Rio's If We Were Villains is a masterpiece. With characters you cannot help but love, while driving you to hair-pulling frustration, Rio weaves the line of morality wonderfully. As the characters are drawn into the world of Shakespeare, you are drawn into theirs. Just when you think you have it figured out, Rio pulls the rug out from under you, time and time again, ending with a finale that will leave you in a daze. The intricacies of language Rio uses tell the reader exactly what is going to happen, while still maintaining tension, is genius. Upon re-reading the book you will find yourself laughing out loud at how boldly she spelled it all out. If We Were Villains is a book you can sink your teeth into, and I intend to, many times over.
2985612230	Where you able to decipher the clues in James' last note to Oliver?If We Were Villains is an intelligent, well written theatrical thriller, with lots of emotional and physical drama. This is to be expected of a troupe of American theater students whose main focus is Shakespeare's works. The bird's-eye view of casting and producing one of these dramas was interesting, but I felt distanced by those numerous archaic dramatic passages. And yet, these passages did help set the stage for a dark and heavy tone: surely "something wicked this way comes!" James aptly warns everyone during one of his dramatic scenes that we are all deceivers on the stage of life and that we are to trust no one. What a tangled web, indeed, when first we practice to deceive.....! (I'm paraphrasing here.) I was much struck by Oliver's sacrifice and the surprise twist at the end. But after a while.... I grew dissatisfied. We are given subtle hints that the relationship between Oliver and James is deeper and more involved than mere friendship. Oliver and James might have feelings for one another, but Oliver also has a "thing" for the lovely Meredith. Then James gets passionate with Wren and does a 365 and makes a pass at Meredith. Orgy, anyone?Well, not quite, but that was a fair amount of bed-hopping. I was starting to lose track of who was sleeping with whom! And yes, I get that Oliver and James were reacting out of jealousy most of the time, but their reticence seemed unnatural. They were all actors after all, and quite used to exploring the hidden meanings and emotional motivations behind their character's actions and dialogue. (But I get that the story would have been over far too soon had Oliver and James had their "lightbulb" moment earlier in this drama.)Too late, Oliver realizes his true feelings for James, which he refused to admit or disclose either out of discomfort or fear of rejection or jealousy. Oliver makes the ultimate sacrifice of his freedom, because he knows he is mentally and emotionally stronger than the others. Finally, to make things even more melodramatic, in the spirit of all Shakespearean tragedies, Oliver discovers, again too late, upon his release from prison that James has drowned himself. Oliver is left bereft, marking time once again in Meredith's bed. Big, big spoiler alert: (view spoiler)[ But Hark, a note! Those two envelopes, penned by James just before his last fateful swim in the frigid waters of the north Pacific ocean, leave a vital clue that only Oliver can decipher. Hope stirs anew in Oliver's grieving heart: James' body was never found - he may well still be alive! The root of my dissatisfaction: Emotionally, I wanted a physical/face to face "closure" scene between Oliver and James (and judging by the many Q & A queries for a sequel to the author, I am not alone in this.) That kiss on the hand was not enough.... But I get that the author wanted her readers to do a bit of homework for the potential HEA. I took comfort from James' quote of a passage from Pericles in his last note to Oliver. At the end of Shakespeare's drama, the main character Pericles is miraculously reunited with Thaisa and Marina (the wife and daughter whom he had mistakenly thought were dead and buried at sea). The fickle hand of Fate, which had parted the happy family, was moved once again to reunite these beleaguered players. A clever use of misapprehension and misdirection! I have no doubt in my mind that the author is hinting at a similar fate for Oliver and James. What do you think? (hide spoiler)]I would have rated this higher, but the excessive use of direct quotations and excerpts from the various dramas slowed the action down considerably, and interrupted the flow of this novel. I kept pausing to look up the passages and put them into context, which messed with the atmosphere and pacing. (And yes, I studied quite a few of Shakespeare's dramas in high school, and we would often see various productions at our local Stratford Theatre, so I am not unacquainted with his works.) (Note: I have now reread this novel without dwelling on all of the direct quotations, and it was much more enjoyable.) I rate this very well done "intrigue" a 4 out of 5 stars.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
2568265390	*slams hands on table* 5 FUCKING STARSTHIS BOOK WRECKED METHIS BOOK PLAYED WITH MY FEELINGSTHIS BOOK THRUST ME INTO A NIGHTMARE I WAS HAPPY TO BE PART OF Actors are by nature volatile—alchemic creatures composed of incendiary elements, emotion and ego and envy. Heat them up, stir them together, and sometimes you get gold. Sometimes disaster. Reading this book was like drowning in syrup. The epitome of bittersweet. I loved it so much it physically hurts. I’m unable to really talk about it without making it a disservice. I’m going to try here, but know that the only way you can understand what I’m talking about is if you read it. Read the fucking book.What was I even doing with my life before I started this book? These characters are part of me now, they’re so important I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. They’re not three-dimensional, they’re so much more than that. I would be reading and I would feel them breathing on my neck. If that’s not powerful I don’t know what is.So, guess what? I like books with fucked up characters, weird intricate friendship dynamics and murder, what can I do. Which of us could say we were more sinned against than sinning? We were so easily manipulated—confusion made a masterpiece of us. I’d never really read dark academy before this book, but I had always looked fondly at the genre, as if I already knew I would love it. Before this one I’d tried a couple of books that classify as dark academia without even knowing, and I wasn’t a real fan. I’m glad this changed because now my life is not the same anymore and all I want to read is campus novels. How weird that it only takes one book to fall into obsession. Though this is not an ordinary book.This book made me want to read Shakespeare for the first time in my life since high school? Wow. I’ve had the misfortune of never having the occasion to study his work properly in school or uni, and his language has always intimidated me because I don’t understand it, which means I don’t know where to start. Enter this book. I’d love to reread it when I know more about Shakespeare. I can already see how masterfully the author inserted all the tragedies and its characters in the narrative; every play is there in a precise moment and every actor plays a certain Shakespearean character in a certain moment for a reason. Nothing’s random. Nevertheless, I have a feeling I will never really understand how CLEVER this book is.Speaking of which, that foreshadowing, man. The entire narrative is just an ode to obsessive friendship, in both its good and bad connotations. From the beginning you are thrust into the dark world of intimate betrayal, and you can’t help but notice right away. Now that I’m done reading I wonder if there’s even more details I didn’t notice because I didn’t know how the book was going to pan out in the end. ”I think you understand it perfectly. Nothing makes sense to him either. His whole world is falling apart, and once he realizes he can’t stop it or fix it or change it, there’s only one thing left to do.”My eyes adjusted slowly, maddeningly. “What’s that?”His shadow shrugged in the gloom. “Absolve yourself. Blame it on fate.” Oliver was adorable. I was expecting him to be a prick and then he wasn’t. He was the sweetest human being and he must be protected at all costs. The softest moments in the book where his. This book shines a light on him and that’s what he freaking deserves.Oliver and James...let me cry. Not only were they amazing characters, but their dynamics were out of this world. (view spoiler)[The DRAMA of their pushing and pulling, they way they care about each other and both understand and don’t understand at what level they do. I was holding my breath the entire time. I had no idea if the book would go that direction, but then it did and I was crying. Thanks for that, btw. We love when a character fakes his own death. You just gave me a HEART ATTACK, James you idiot. (hide spoiler)] James looked up, looked right at me. He seemed surprised to see me standing there, though I didn’t know for the life of me why he should be. Was I not always his right-hand man, his lieutenant? Banquo or Benvolio or Oliver—little difference. I predicted most of the ending, but honestly? It made me feel powerful, in a way. And who even CARES. This book was magnificent. It hurt me but I want more.

3883312504	How can something that didn't convince me two hours ago break me into so many pieces? Like, crying-gasping-hand on my heart kinda pain.For a moment - a long, disappointed moment -, I thought I didn't like this book. The pace is too slow; the story is too messy with all the characters, names, and things they do and don't do; the plays, all so well-described and full of emotions, seem endless compared to the need of knowing more about what happened.But then you reach a point where nothing of this matter because everything is exactly how it is supposed to be. And it's just perfect.Reading Shakespeare does something strange to me, it's like a drug that I discovered at a young age and no one ever stopped me, so you can imagine my thrill of reading about a bunch of boys and girls doing what I was born to do: become a Shakespearean character and get lost in it. Also, I don't know how many of you studied him in high school or university, but is it great to finally read something by Shakespeare that isn't Romeo and Juliet. Love it, love Leo, love the whole drama… but finally some diversity in the mass culture.So, from my pov, there's only two things you can feel about this book: love or hate. There's no grey area, there's no “I think it’d have been better if”.It's exactly like Shakespeare: you fall in love with him the first time you read his work, or you spend your life not knowing what you've lost.↠ 5 starsp.s.: about the ending, I'm as shock as I was when I finished it. And yes, I'm that type of person who believes an open ending has the same value as a “no body, no crime, no death” rule.

5321507351	But that is how a tragedy like ours or King Lear breaks your heart—by making you believe that the ending might still be happy, until the very last minute. somebody erase this book from my mind so i can relive it again. please, and thank you. -------it'll be a miracle if we finish this br without losing our goddamn minds 😭 I'm excited tho 🤌🏻
1651964192	Oh god here's to hoping I don't get lynched for this. Personally, I find making book comparisons in reviews distasteful and frankly insulting to both writers. However there are times when a work comes up with startling similarities before you decide to roll your eyes, and say ok, Cassandra Clare, plagiarizing the Harry Potter series for The Iron Trial is not cool at all (and yes, it's been years but LET ME BE PETTY). I'm not claiming that IWWV is a copy of The Secret History. Certainly there is more to the novel and Rio brings her own brand of refreshing originality. Nevertheless a core part that makes up the bare-bones skeleton of the world the 7 main characters function in IS a mirror reflection of TSH.A list compiled in my reading notes:1. IWWV: All 7 students are thespians // TSH: All 6 study classics. Both are commonly seen as 'elite' fields that are hard to 'break' into.2. IWWV: Regards each other as "siblings" as repeatedly mentioned by Oliver, (to paraphrase a quote) the closeness of the group meant that there was nothing about each other could any longer affect them // TSH: Richard sees Julian's students (before he joined them) as 'otherworldly' in a way that only they shared - "sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ore ferebat". 3. In both books the characters are specially chosen for their subject; no other students study the same courses as they do. Reinforces exclusivity and especially a 'me vs everyone else' attitude of superiority in the characters. Heavy inter-reliance within the groups. 4. Both protagonists (Oliver and Richard) are 'the odd man out'. They are less talented than their peers and both groups know this. Also personally I find them to be painfully bland; perhaps for them to better reflect the brighter & more beautiful like a mirror for the readers. And perhaps to reinforce their longing and precarious position in this elite world that they hunger for, which IMO is a easy way out of explaining their motivations w/ continuing their idiocy (shhh). 5. Mostly because both protagonists come from lower-middle class/middle-class (?) backgrounds with families and homes they would like to leave behind.6. Both groups reenacts the course of (Shakespearian vs Greek) tragedy in their lives. 7. Both groups had a member that they murdered.8. Said murdered person transforms into an increasingly erratic and uncontrollable character throughout the novel's progression, until they reach a place where both groups consider that murder is the only choice.9. Both groups are taught by mentor(s) that are (at best) unconventional with teaching methods, giving lessons that in turn affect the characters. The university is badly structured with a ridiculous system that allows and in a way encourages these groups to be formed. 10. Arguably both books can be split into two parts: what led up to the murder and then focuses on the remaining characters (and their terrible coping methods) immediately afterwards//So! I'll leave this one for you to think about. Similarities aside, this kind of setting that both novels use is unrealistic at best. Personally I find that Donna Tartt makes it work. Her lush prose draws the readers into a place where time is made to seem longer than it actually is. Richard constantly narrates these long stream of consciousness / wallowing / whatever Greek Philosophical Of The Day to the readers. Other aspects build onto this feeling; Julian's lavishly decorated room, and the concepts he discusses (the Divine, beauty, terror), so different and far from 'mainstream' education. Isolation in its all encompassing variety, from Henry's intellectualism to purposely barring themselves from the outside world. Most of the novel takes place where they are alone: their rooms, the library, Julian's classrooms, the ravine, car rides. Whenever they are in a place with other people they are uncomfortable, restless, even to the point of being violent. Snow. The hyper-surrealist quality that saturates everything in the novel helps provide a plausible acceptance for the readers, in regards to the oddity of the characters, and the way they choose to behave in. And as for Rio... I don't know. Mostly her writing is so different from Tartt; If We Were Villains is fast paced, and in turn intriguing. Yet when the scantly detailed prose and lack of character exposition works perfectly for action, it fails to build a satisfying case for the characters that makes them understandable. When everything dramatically falls apart, and the characters choose to behave in their puzzling and overly dramatic ways, I was disenchanted with how their relatively reasonable conduct quickly gives away to unreasonable choices. If you are to be morally ambiguous and make bad decisions; fine. Give me a reason, give me motivations for your actions! To avoid spoilers, and badly paraphrase a mis-remembered quote - there is nothing beautiful or monstrous in being evil for evil's sake. This is not to say that If We Were Villains was not enjoyable to read; rather, it is that I found the first half of the novel that made the latter part captivating - to be quite frustrating. (Also: I loved the ending; it made me go all slow and syrupy inside, warm like molasses.) 3.5 stars
2743010417	4.5 starsthis book was cruel for tricking me into reading shakespeare, but it was even more cruel for THAT ENDING!!!!! i'm happy that this is not the book i thought it would be. i feared that it would be dry and overly-scholarly, since i'm not the biggest fan of shakespeare. but it read almost like a YA book with its easiness to comprehend. it definitely had gorgeous, flowing writing to help the reader along.i buddy read this with my bestie bonnie and it was really fun to volley theories back and forth about the murder and how it paralleled the shakespeare plays they did. this book was atmospheric and character-focused with an interesting setting at a pretentious boarding school for the arts, which i know will be a lot of people's cup of tea. for me i wish there was slightly more explanation on what made the characters tick to suddenly become so dark. but if you need a book to read in a group or a club, i HIGHLY recommend this one. lots to discuss.
7385017589	After serving jail time for a murder, he may or may not have committed, Oliver Marks is met by the detective who put him away, Colborne, who just wants to know, for his own peace of mind, what really happened at the elite arts college ten years ago. Oliver agrees to share the details of what really happened, swearing Colborne to secrecy - how the changing of their types of roles in Shakespearian plays catalysed the problems within their small elite final-year group within an elite establishment and led to mayhem and murder!A compelling, absorbing near-hypnotic piece of dark academia, compared to The Secret History which tells a story of an elite insular too-close nihilistic group from the perspective of a new comer to the group, this literary mystery-thriller tells a story of an elite insular too-close nihilistic group from the perspective of a seemingly lesser member of the group, Oliver. Like the great literary works for me, it was the journey that I found compelling more than the actual mystery that I found very much secondary. A deftly crafted cast of unlikeable characters, shrouded in mystery as I only connected with them through Oliver’s lens had me glued to this book throughout. What makes this book standout is that the writer uses the fact that the group are all superb actors as a tool and a crutch that meant that I never know, and still don't, what their true feelings, reactions and rationale are! Literary writing at its most entertaining and accessible, easily a Four Star, 8 out of 12 read2025 read
3986944205	4.25 “Secrets carry weight, like lead.” StarsThoughts:My drama and literature teachers would be so proud if they knew how much analyzing I did while reading this. As a reader who has been strongly opposed to touching any Shakespeare after my distaste when it was forced into my curriculum growing up. Here I am now ready to reread the great works and give them another chance. I guess with time a person can change especially when it comes to the benefit of a mystery read with bookish besties!Yeah, you could read this book straight through and enjoy it, but this book is not meant to just be read. It is meant to be experienced. You are the detective. The clues and awe is unlocked after searching through the plays and the artistry to find the revelations and tie-ins to the story. There are many!! The research M.L. Rio put into this work shows, and I bow down to authors who give me jaw dropping moments of foreshadowing that is not too forced or only discovered through taking time with the work and looking into its subject matter.The separation of chapters and parts into acts was brilliantly done. I also love a book that purposefully finds ways to make you deeply dislike each character for separate things that could be described as human nature, but turned even darker (very deadly sin-like). I wanted to do a breakdown of the characters, but learning (and disliking) them all on your own is part of the fun. However, a future reread may bring me back to do just that.The only reason this book was dropped from a 5 star read to a 4.25 is due to predictability from almost the first act for me, and because I am an avid open-ending hater. It’s my downfall. I am stubborn too, so if I get caught up in guessing one character then I am stuck with them. I wish I was dissuaded from guessing that one person by the author a little bit more. Overall this read is one I would highly recommend. I recommend it even more with a friend. The theater kid in me is thriving after this, and happy we turned out more sane than others.My loves, my friends, my little detectives (lulu, maya, aliki, anmol, cait, lila, rae, lilyya, mahek, youssra, vee and vio) - this read would not have been the same without you. It is one I will treasure forever! I cannot wait for the other chaotic buddy reads our future holds!P.s. - My new and odd phrase that I learned is sexually amphibious. I can’t use it in a sentence and please don’t ask lol.

5201085747	This book is really good but it would have been better if it was gayer.
3402449930	disappointed to report that my feelings towards this book are exactly what i thought they’d be. before i started reading, i told myself that i didn’t want to compare it to the secret history, however as i got further into it the many similarities became hard to ignore and due to this, i found it quite difficult to separate the two books.similar to the secret history, the friendship group was set up to have a very complex and interesting dynamic, but it never came to fruition and instead they all felt one-note. not to mention that the character types themselves felt eerily similar to those in the secret history e.g. oliver as the naive outsider (richard papen), richard as the strongest and smartest (he’s basically a mix of henry winter and bunny corcoran), alexander as the troubled one with addiction issues (charles macaulay), james as the soft and sensitive one (francis abernathy), meredith as the femme fatale (a slightly more promiscuous version of camilla macaulay). there are 2 other girls in the friendship group, but they don’t seem to have much relevance and were definitely the least developed characters. if you strip away the specifics, both the plot structure and the themes of this book are almost identical to the secret history. granted, i know a lot of dark academia books often have this structure, but i would’ve liked some more originality. the similarities unfortunately made this book very predictable and i guessed everything that was going to happen (including who ended up dead, the twist, and part of the ending) which obviously took away from my enjoyment. also, because the book was fast-paced, the stakes felt quite low and so they all seemed to be acting rather melodramatic to me. i actually think this book would’ve benefited from being a bit longer, as it would’ve allowed both the characters and plot to be more fleshed out. some claim this book is a shorter, faster-paced version of the secret history (or the secret history for dummies). i think trying to write a book similar to donna tartt’s debut is stacking the odds against yourself, because you just can’t win against the secret history. it’s deemed a modern classic for a reason, and this book just reads like a rip-off. if you’re debating between reading this and the secret history, read the secret history. it’s the original, and it just does it better. also, for my petty reason, this book has the line ‘i exhale the breath i didn’t know i was holding’ which i just can’t forgive.
2778443027	5 sonnet-inspiring starsAn anti-Shakespeare reader reads a book structured, centered, and deeply versed in Shakespeare...and literally falls head over heels for it? If We Were Villains was amazing. Writing: ★★★★★Structure: ★★★★★Characters: ★★★★★Pacing: ★★★★★Seven senior year college students at an intense fine arts conservatory in Illinois find themselves in their own version of a Shakespearean tragedy as real life begins to blur around the edges of Shakespeare's verse. The hero, the villain, the tyrant, the ingenue, the temptress, the extra. Who plays who, and when, and why? What happens when you become immersed into your role?Oliver Marks has just spent 10 years in prison for a murder he may or may not have committed. He's never revealed the truth - until now. Voicing his story to the primary case detective in an off-the-record interview on the site of the crime, Oliver recounts his tragedy in the structure of Shakespeare—in 5 Acts.I was hooked by this.It is technically Oliver's point of view, but the story unfolds in almost third-person narration as the events of the group's fourth year unravel in atmospheric detail. There is the perfect amount of foreshadowing from Oliver—one liners that allude to future events, etc.—but for the most part, we're living the year alongside the students in real time. One of If We Were Villains's main selling points is its claustrophobic and almost familial approach to its primary cast of characters. Evoking the unique collegiate mindset of the "found family" friend group in close proximity, the cast of main characters feels disturbingly entwined, and causes deep set emotions to bubble to the surface as the seven work, live, practice, sleep, and act together as one (fractured) unit. I won't go into the seven's individual roles in the book, as part of the fun is immediate internal typecasting and subsequent role shifts that occur naturally. Suffice to say, it's obvious that all is not as it initially appears. If We Were Villains is a one of a kind adventure with a truly unforgettable cast. You'll think about these characters long after you close the book. If you're a fan of the theater, I imagine this is an easy sell. I was not (and still am not) a theater person. But If We Were Villains transcends its typecasting and has an appeal for all, not just those who can smell paint on the stage sets. This crime could have happened elsewhere, but it is best shown in its purest habitat—the theater. If I had to pick a negative, the characters' penchant for speaking in snippets of Shakespearean verse was hard to pick up at first...and I'll be the first to admit that occasionally, I skimmed those dialogue chunks. Shakespeare is definitely a living, breathing entity in these characters lives, and in order to dive deep into their story you must dive deep into the Shakespeare they surround themselves with. It's a lot to take in at the beginning, but as you spiral down into the plot it almost (okay, not quite) disappears into the background. This is a strong contender for my favorite fiction (mystery?) of all time. Recommended for anyone who enjoys entangled plot lines with close friend groups, theater-inspired stories, the Bard (of course), and viciously emotionally-motivated crimes.
3587268879	quite frankly broken
4109619384	I went into the read thinking "there's no way I'll dislike this." I am happy to report that HOLY HELL I'M OBSESSED WITH THIS BOOK. It hit every note perfectly: ✔ The epitome of Dark Academia ✔ Distinct, richly-explored, morally grey characters ✔ Theatre!! Shakespeare!! Tragedy!! ✔ Academic rivals ✔ Writing so stunning that made me ache because it was that beautiful ✔ Characters who often speak to one another in the form of Shapsearean verse and prose, pulling from loads of Shakespeare's plays ✔ The fine lines between friendship and lust, lust and repulsionSomeone somewhere is going to call this book pretentious and/or be irritated that the novel isn't 'accessible'And you know what? I'm perfectly fine with that. It should be pretentious. The 7 main characters—obsessive stage actors—are the only remaining students in their year because their highly-exclusive, small arts university culls the wheat from the chaff annually. "Actors are by nature volatile—alchemic creatures composed of incendiary elements, emotion and ego and envy. Heat them up, stir them together, and sometimes you get gold. Sometimes disaster." This is a masterpiece, and the more you know about Shakespeare's plays, the more impressed you'll be with the tragedy Rio weaves.One final note: I both read the physical book and listened to the audiobook. I HIGHLY recommend the audiobook because the narrator, Robert Petkoff, does an absolutely phenomenal job bringing each of the characters to life. I want to listen to it all over again. And again. And again.
5899670275	4.5 ⭐️I'm literally so mad at myself rn for sleeping on this book for so long when it was literally SO. GOOD. 😩😩 My first dark academia and it was PERFECT for spooky season!! Ugh i love this book 🖤🖤🫶🫶“You can justify anything if you do it poetically enough.”If We Were Villains follows seven friends studying Shakespeare and acting at an elite conservatory. Our narrator, Oliver, notices that his talented classmates seem to play the same roles even when they're off the stage- villain, hero, temptress- with him always having a supporting role. Then when the castings change, a friendly rivalry turns ugly and things get violent. Then tragedy occurs and one of the friends is found dead. It is now ten years later and Oliver has just been released from prison for the murder. He now reunites with the detective who put him in prison, who wants to know what really happened that night...“But that is how a tragedy like ours or King Lear breaks your heart—by making you believe that the ending might still be happy, until the very last minute.”The dark academia genre has always seemed really interesting to me but I've just never actually picked one up until now. And I am literally so glad I randomly decided to try this bc hello it was amazing?! 🫶🫶I feel like there are some books that I just read for pure entertainment and then once I'm done, I forget about them. But then are those books that are just so good that they stick in your memory and you still feel so connected to the story even after turning the last page- and this is one of those books for me. I don't think I'll be forgetting about it anytime soon.So much of this book is just soo well done and the characters were definitely part of that!! ✨️ These are some of the most fascinating characters i've ever read about. What i think M.L. Rio did perfectly was capturing how complicated they all were. Following their characters along on this story and exploring their complexities was an experience 🤌🤌 l I think I hated and loved them all in equal measure. Are these good people? Absolutely not. But i connected so deeply to them throughout this book and i miss them all already 🥺🥺🥺The writing was also so freaking good 🖤🖤 It was such a unique style of writing and while it was weird at first, once I got used to it, I loved it. The characters do quote Shakespeare all the time but even if that seems intimidating, please still read this. I have never read one of Shakespeare's plays nor do I know much about them, but I could still fully grasp what was going on. In fact, the Shakespeare quotes actually immersed me even more in the story and I felt like I was there with those characters, studying theatre alongside them 🫶🫶Plus the vibes of this book were absolutely PERFECT 😩😩 My first dark academia and now i desperately need more!! It was all so dark and autumnal and the aesthetic was *chefs kiss*. The atmosphere just made this book even better than it already was 🖤✨️The storyline was also executed so well imo. The way the story unravelled kept me glued to the page and i was so intrigued the whole time. it never got boring or dragged. That ending tho-- 💔💔💔 i am not okay. if you don't want a book with an ending that will rip your heart out your chest and stomp on it- stay far away from this book 🙃“When did we become such terrible people?”“Maybe we’ve always been terrible.”Overall, this was soo worth the hype 😍😍 Not quite a 5 ⭐️ for me, but it was pretty close. Definitely pick this up if you're looking for:✔ Dark academia✔ Such complex characters✔ Amazing writing✔ Great storyThis book was, simply put, exquisite 🖤🖤🖤《 2023 Challenge: Book 125 of 110!! 》~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Oh my gosh. This was SO. GOOD 😩😩 loved the setting, the dark academia vibes and the characters- it was all *chefs kiss* 🖤🖤🫶🫶That ending tho-- 💔 I am unwell.I need 2-3 business days to recover, so rtc!
7201033344	“ I need language to live, like food. Morsels of meaning nourish me with the knowledge that, yes, there is a word for this. Someone else has felt it before “ Ah , lights camera action. Im ready. Cause I’m for real about to talk this up to the max 🎭. Benevolently, allow me to present this gleaming masterpiece that flexes the English language in tenfolds. Similarly to the quote above, this book’s theatrical essence enlivened me with the realization that, yes, this is why my fondness for reading lives on, and knowing someone else has also felt this, makes it wholesome. If we were the villains is a clear love letter to theatre enthusiasts, but here’s the main thing - it’s a nod to storytelling. Told in movie like Acts and Scenes that are indulged with that resonating Shakespearean wit : I couldn’t help but rave over the brilliance that my eyes were visually consuming. Being a theatre lover, I was honestly impressed with the amount of bursting references that were intentionally painted inside these pages. The astounding feat is that they were dazzlingly fitting to what is being said and what is being hinted at. Hold on though, I got y’all. Let me answer the million dollar question. Do you have to be deeply rooted in the existence of theatre to eat this up? To understand it? Or to even like it? Thankfully, Nah. You don’t. No stress required. Because the story is there. The execution is chefs and easily digestible beginning to end for anyone. Meet seven unhinged, but talented actors and In fancier terms, “Thespians” ( feel free to show off this new vocabulary term cause its a high-key smart way of saying actor also, I learned it from this exact book hehe) Oliver, Meredith, James, Richard, Wren, Filipa, and Alexander. All of these thespians are evidently dismantled, humanized ,and intensely flawed but. That’s the allure. This profound darkness they contain in themselves was compelling to the brim. Whether I was swooning over Meredith, rooting on for Oliver, laughing with Alexander or just supporting the rest of the amazing cast in their own respective moments. Every single on them bring their uniqueness to this grand luminous and shall I say ominous stage ‼️A stage where shit hits the fan, and a murdering mystery unravels. Investigations ensues, and guilt inevitably pursues. But who can hide it best? Considering they’re all actors, and who has actually done it? Simple. Find out. And trust you will find out in the most symbolic, poetic, and anticlimactic way where applause or frustrations may follow. Because Every character. Every moment. Every dialogue. And every literary technique is coalesced to this method of unraveling a hauntingly mesmeric experience. A experience that I for one, won’t forget anytime soon. “Live Boldly - Make art, make mistakes, and have no regrets” Well fuck, allow this to be a mic drop quote that i use on anyone and everyone 🤌💀. I hereby say this book might have been the reason why i jokingly considered dropping out of my uni to enroll in a full on theatre school in attempts of becoming an actor 🎬😂. You know a book just hits different, and this was different. In the best way possible, aha.

5316297610	TW: death; physical abuse; emotional abuse; bullying; drug abuse; overdose; suicide; homophobia; drowning This is a heavy, dark academia that has a narrative structure which keeps you on your toes until the end but also allows the space for the characters to exist and feel real. This is an odd experience where the characters are both likable and not, but you do tend to understand their motivations. The moments that you don’t is what kept it from quite being a 5 star for me. But the writing is spectacular and I think the use of a very vague ending works well here.
5083366552	I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who recommended this lighthearted, bright, comedic romance to me I am not, in fact, currently recovering from a 48 hour session of intense sobbing. This book ripped my heart out, stomped on it, destroyed it, and shoved it back into my chest. WARNING: If you do not want this to happen to you, I highly recommend you avoid this book and stay a solid 10 mile radius away from it. This book is a guarantee heartbreak, but of course I loved it. How else would I fulfill my duty as a devastatingly sad book lover?
