6705450535	2 Stars almost entirely for the art alone because god this was insufferable for how short it actually was. Or boring is the right word maybe. Too much infodump at the start of the story, too much telling, etc etc.Sighh, even LittleChimera's art couldn't save Olivie Blake's storytelling abilities?
4067300382	the artwork was beautiful but the narration was exhausting and gave me all around bad vibes
4095823891	Well, I read part one, started with part two which is still updating as of now. I might change my rating after that's done. An enjoyable story so far with fantastic art (let me just stress that for a second). I do however despise our MC. I don't even know why. I can't pinpoint something about her that explains this aversion other than maybe mediocrity. I know that's a whole thing in her arc but I just don't think it works the way it's supposed to. I'd like some more Jonah tbh. A whole POV would be nice because honestly, he's the interesting one. Why would I want to read about this random small town white girl virgin when I could be reading about him instead, yaknow. And Nick .. well .. he wears Louboutins, I can't hate him.
4654751732	3.5 ⭐ overallThis was good. At least what is written is good. This was clearly supposed to be longer and then the author and the illustrator never came back. Even season 2 ends with them writing out, "See you next week." And that was a year ago.But what was here is good. Especially season one. Very interesting and unique take the devil walking around among us. Was captivated with the temptation and manipulation throughout all of season 1. Season 2 is good, but definitely wasn't expecting the sudden change in direction. But it all started coming together and just when I started to enjoy it the comic ended.....The art was absolutely amazing. Beautiful from beginning to end with an almost seductive style that is very fitting for the story told here. I especially loved that when we got character perspective changes the art changed with it to match the new character. Really good stuff there!Overall this was good. A little overly confusing sometimes, but still good. And would probably be even better if the story ever got finished. I will update my review if more is added that I can comment on.
4102156291	The only word I can think of is mesmerized. I was sure I would not like the story but would enjoy the artwork, and in fact, I was stunned by both. I've read the first section of it and I'm planning on getting to the next part soon, but heavens above, I am numb because that was just so beautiful my heart aches a little bit even now. I forgot how much I love those stories, pensive, mysterious, maybe pretensions to someone's liking; stories that are elusive and vague. I think I want to feel a little bit deprived while I'm reading. Books that leave me wanting more in all senses are the ones I cherish most. And this one is what I've been longing for.
4024180251	You guys should read this not only because the artwork is literally my favorite I've come across so far, but it's also free on webtoon. You're welcome besties 😚💕I had to take one star away because it was a bit too short 😔✌🏻
6320425211	Clara and the Devil is an intriguing and atmospheric read that explores the realms of supernatural and mystery with a hint of philosophy. The art style was beautiful in every single panel of the book and Olivie Blake’s writing style is to die for. I very much enjoyed the concept and the idea of the book, but I found it fell a bit short in the pacing of the story (It’s also a webtoon lmao what am I expecting tbh).
6698828943	I love it your honour!!!! The art style is just 😍😍 and the story itself is just so up my alley. WHERE IS SEASON 3 ???? THEY HAVENT UPDATED IN OVER A YEAR 😭😭😭
4071524608	honestly, this story was cringe and abrupt to a fault. every chapter just seems like a new beginning as there is literally no flow to it. not to mention, all the characters felt more like notions than actual people with personalities, making it monotonous as fuck.however, the artworks are gorgeous. i think this book makes a good sketch reference.
3828015976	i mean,,, i also wish the devil wanted my soul. i'm obsessed with this story and the art was so beautiful!!!
4810177743	this was like bulgakov’s master and margarita… except the plot went nowhere and the writing was a bunch of words haphazardly stringed together to mean everything and nothing at all… the artwork is incredibly beautiful and refined, though 2.5
4043943170	bisexual, sexy e irrelevante,,, just like meme dio media vergüenza ajena por momentos pero meh fue sexc y tremendas ilustraciones
4820993075	i hope we get another episode because i want more 😭 little chmura and olivie blake, you will always be my favorite duo!!! anything you both make is a banger!!!
4767227826	Author & Artist are top tier for me forever. I trust Olivie and the not knowing, and Chmura shows just enough *chef's kiss*
5949656696	it definitely had potential to go somewhere but unfortunately was not given the opportunity to do so
4075108324	ngl this was bad but the illustrations are beautiful so at least there’s that
4513057862	this is not a story about falling in love with the devil. it's a story about falling in love with sin.here are some of my favourite tropes:🐍 being tempting is not the same as being evil. the devil will only show you the way if you let him.🐍 two best friends who thought that they were satisfied with the mundane, get a taste for power and will do anything to keep that hunger from devouring them.🐍 no gender. no sexuality. just fluid sins in the shape of the dreams you pretend you don't remember.🐍 sitting with the oldest entity in the universe as he whispers sweetly the past, the present, and the future in your ears.
4274704543	10/6/2021 - Clara and the Devil Part I5/5 starsThis webcomic is the perfect Faustian fantasy that reads like a contemporary slice-of-life story! Blake's elegant and mysterious storytelling is perfectly matched by Little Chmura's absolutely stunning art.4/15/2022 - Clara and the Devil Part II4/5 starsStill a greatly intriguing series and I can't wait to see where it goes next!5/7/2023 - Clara and the Devil Part III3.5/5 stars
3999233522	Ngl I came here for the GORGEOUS artwork but the story was kind of.... interesting? Is that the right word? I’m grinning but I’m not sure why😂 I’m still not really sure what was going on but I would read it again!
4646564206	<3333 ah woah
3926595069	4 stars because the artwork is stunning, and the writing nails the surreal, dream-like mood. It feels a bit unsubstantial plot-wise, but it sure is pretty.
5313285239	Read it here.Another graphics-heavy story collaboration between Little Chmura and Olivie Blake, another time I'm left with an unfinished WIP wondering what's next, and it falls into the same problems as Alpha and Alpha II. The art is gorgeous, I'd give the traditional art 4 stars (higher when you can actually tell the characters apart -- why do so many look the same?) and the doodles throughout 2-3, but I'd give the writing 2 stars on a good day.There's no proper worldbuilding, you know nothing about any characters and have no real reason to be invested in them, and you're never given any answers and only taken on a journey where you get more questions. And then it leaves you on a cliffhanger (this one is less bad than Alpha's by a long shot, though!) and it's unclear if future updates will EVER be coming.Overall, not really worth the time sunk into it, which is unfortunate. I loved the premise, but then it never went anywhere.
8085431694	I thought the art work in this was just absolutely stunning! I do think this is one of those books that I will have to find a physical copy of because I could return to it again and again just to stare at.The story is a little slow and a bit monologuey. It did in some ways remind me of when your adhd friend tells a story and goes on a little tangent every now and again .but in the best way possible. Its giving a foreign film vibe in the pacing, which I could see some people not enjoying. However, I did really appreciate that in many of those scenes it relies heavily on the art to further the story. Overall I really did enjoy it and want to see where it heads to in Volume 2. I do hope that it has a little more of the story part in the next one. I would definitely recommend this especially for the art!
4055853513	5 stars for the art. I mean wow it was so beautiful and the characters looked hot and beautiful at the same time.2 stars or lower, I’m still not sure, for the actual story, one aspect is that it only had a few chapters so everything happened too quick for me. Another aspect is that because of the fact that everything went by way too quick for my liking I sadly could not enjoy Claras character, the fact that she folded so easily and quick to the Devil just didn’t make it for me. I would’ve liked more restraint or doubts and all. Overall a weird story, amazing illustrations but sadly not as enticing as I thought it would be.
4130967748	(3.5) I'm finding it quite difficult to 1) rate this and 2) say if I've finished this because it's a webtoon comic that has episodes being released weekly. But, as I'm all caught up now, I will say that it took me a bit at first to get attached to the characters, but the art O M G!!! so pretty, and, yes, the story is quite addicting, I'll give them that. It's free on Webtoon, I would give it a shot. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
6861257177	It is an undeniably interesting comic, but it feels a little meandering. There's a plot, but not really, and there's a lot of vagueness. That doesn't make it bad, just something to be aware of.I enjoyed the first run more than the second run, but it is still good! And the art is absolutely stunning.
4402983279	Olivie Blake and Little Chmura could make an illustrated grocery list and I would read it. For this particular work, I didn't even care about the story. The artwork was just the most beautiful thing I have seen. I also love how Blake's plots are always not what they appear to be at first.(Rating for the first section only)
4187447299	Zaujímavá téma pokušenia v živote, Diabol, hriechy a opojný pocit moci. Občas mi text nedával zmysel ale to som už pri Olivii zvyknutá, jej pretentious štýl písania je síce ojedinelý ale rozhodne nie je nijak superior. Prečo sa oplatilo túto grafickú novelu prečítať bolo rozhodne to ako bola ilustrovaná. Krásne kresby od Little Chmura sú to čo celý čas ťahalo tento komix.
4510382873	I think more people should read this!! It’s got a feverish yet icy cold feel to to it that makes you feel like you’re in a deeper, drearier part of wonderland. The characters rope you in, and the art speaks for itself. I think that it’s a must read for anyone who enjoys dark-academia style things
4093964618	don’t really know what i just read but the art is sexy.
4074836518	absolutely beautiful artwork and the story is very intriguing! my only wish is that there was more detail/development but i get why it’s short and sweet. anyways i’m excited for future updates
5789631271	Mostly because of the art and vibe
4290560642	At first I wasn’t sure if I’d like this but I actually really do and look forward to reading more when it comes out!
4821016565	interesting and the art is beautiful.
3986725688	i love how philosophical this is and the art style is so beautiful it has enchanted me completely
5225355428	beautiful artwork but I have no fucking clue what's going on.
5318735837	Obsessed…. I want Olivie Blake to right my vows, my obituary, my resume, my grocery list. Whatever. Everything she writes is gold and magic.And the illustrations? GTFOOH. It’s soooo good!
5470775714	i could only think of that american horror story quote about the devil and fallen angel and the grip it had on me on 2014 tumblr
4500292649	*1.5 the art carried this
7896241993	Clara stronger than me, I would allow the devil to seduce me and then I would even thank him
4536851241	Artwork and vibes were absolutely immaculate. The story however was aimless and severely lacking.
4032272440	The art was absolutely beautiful, and the story left me wanting more. That Q&A doesn't help, either!
4361368125	this art style is so
6363323422	This better be an ongoing series because I'm literally eating it up
3859769822	freaking gorgeous
5091848652	Overall, it was an enjoyable graphic novel. The art style is STUNNING! Wow. 5/5 stars for the illustrations.
5364815131	i like blake’s writing & the art style is beautiful but the story is lacking a lot so I’m not enjoying it that much
4193673000	just finished part one, that art was superb
5463772488	saved from 1 star by the artwork
4073465912	3.5 (:
5340741340	Will be updated after season 2Pro tip: read it’s chapter in The Lovers Grim first
5472104077	If you didn’t like part 1, KEEP READING!!! Olivie is back at it again with the most brilliant characters and Little Chmura with the most gorgeous art (ug those blue eyes I’m going to see in my sleep). This updates about weekly btw
